Now...
let's go back in time.
It's 1974.
There is the gallery somewhere
in the world,
and there is a young girl, age 23,
standing in the middle of the space.
In the front of her is a table.
On the table there are 76 objects
for pleasure and for pain.
Some of the objects are
a glass of water, a coat, a shoe, a rose.
But also the knife,
the razor blade, the hammer
and the pistol with one bullet.
There are instructions which say,
"I'm an object.
You can use everything on the table on me.
I'm taking all responsibility --
even killing me.
And the time is six hours."
The beginning of this
performance was easy.
People would give me
the glass of water to drink,
they'd give me the rose.
But very soon after,
there was a man who took the scissors
and cut my clothes,
and then they took the thorns of the rose
and stuck them in my stomach.
Somebody took the razor blade
and cut my neck and drank the blood,
and I still have the scar.
The women would tell the men what to do.
And the men didn't rape me
because it was just a normal opening,
and it was all public,
and they were with their wives.
They carried me around
and put me on the table,
and put the knife between my legs.
And somebody took the pistol and bullet
and put it against my temple.
And another person took the pistol
and they started a fight.
And after six hours were finished,
I...
started walking towards the public.
I was a mess.
I was half-naked, I was full of blood
and tears were running down my face.
And everybody escaped, they just ran away.
They could not confront myself,
with myself as a normal human being.
And then --
what happened
is I went to the hotel,
it was at two in the morning.
And
I looked at myself in the mirror,
and I had a piece of gray hair.
Alright --
please take off your blindfolds.
Welcome to the performance world.
First of all, let's explain
what the performance is.
So many artists,
so many different explanations,
but my explanation
for performance is very simple.
Performance is a mental
and physical construction
that the performer makes
in a specific time
in a space in front of an audience
and then energy dialogue happens.
The audience and the performer
make the piece together.
And the difference between
performance and theater is huge.
In the theater, the knife is not a knife
and the blood is just ketchup.
In the performance,
the blood is the material,
and the razor blade or knife is the tool.
It's all about being there
in the real time,
and you can't rehearse performance,
because you can't do many
of these types of things twice -- ever.
Which is very important,
the performance is --
you know, all human beings
are always afraid of very simple things.
We're afraid of suffering,
we're afraid of pain,
we're afraid of mortality.
So what I'm doing --
I'm staging these kinds of fears
in front of the audience.
I'm using your energy,
and with this energy I can go
and push my body as far as I can.
And then I liberate myself
from these fears.
And I'm your mirror.
If I can do this for myself,
you can do it for you.
After Belgrade, where I was born,
I went to Amsterdam.
And you know, I've been doing performances
since the last 40 years.
And here I met Ulay,
and he was the person
I actually fell in love with.
And we made, for 12 years,
performances together.
You know the knife
and the pistols and the bullets,
I exchange into love and trust.
So to do this kind work
you have to trust the person completely
because this arrow
is pointing to my heart.
So, heart beating and adrenaline
is rushing and so on,
is about trust, is about total trust
to another human being.
Our relationship was 12 years,
and we worked on so many subjects,
both male and female energy.
And as every relationship
comes to an end, ours went too.
We didn't make phone calls
like normal human beings do
and say, you know, "This is over."
We walked the Great Wall
of China to say goodbye.
I started at the Yellow Sea,
and he started from the Gobi Desert.
We walked, each of us, three months,
two and a half thousand kilometers.
It was the mountains, it was difficult.
It was climbing, it was ruins.
It was, you know, going through
the 12 Chinese provinces,
this was before China was open in '87.
And we succeeded to meet in the middle
to say goodbye.
And then our relationship stopped.
And now, it completely changed
how I see the public.
And one very important piece
I made in those days
was "Balkan Baroque."
And this was the time of the Balkan Wars,
and I wanted to create
some very strong, charismatic image,
something that could serve
for any war at any time,
because the Balkan Wars are now finished,
but there's always some war, somewhere.
So here I am washing
two and a half thousand
dead, big, bloody cow bones.
You can't wash the blood,
you never can wash shame off the wars.
So I'm washing this six hours, six days,
and wars are coming off these bones,
and becoming possible --
an unbearable smell.
But then something stays in the memory.
I want to show you the one
who really changed my life,
and this was the performance in MoMa,
which I just recently made.
This performance --
when I said to the curator,
"I'm just going to sit at the chair,
and there will be
an empty chair at the front,
and anybody from the public
can come and sit as long as they want."
The curator said to me,
"That's ridiculous, you know,
this is New York,
this chair will be empty,
nobody has time to sit in front of you."
(Laughter)
But I sit for three months.
And I sit everyday, eight hours --
the opening of the museum --
and 10 hours on Friday
when the museum is open 10 hours,
and I never move.
And I removed the table
and I'm still sitting,
and this changed everything.
This performance,
maybe 10 or 15 years ago --
nothing would have happened.
But the need of people to actually
experience something different,
the public was not anymore the group --
relation was one to one.
I was watching these people,
they would come and sit in front of me,
but they would have to wait
for hours and hours and hours
to get to this position,
and finally, they sit.
And what happened?
They are observed by the other people,
they're photographed,
they're filmed by the camera,
they're observed by me
and they have nowhere to escape
except in themselves.
And that makes a difference.
There was so much pain and loneliness,
there's so much incredible things
when you look in somebody else's eyes,
because in the gaze
with that total stranger,
that you never even say one word --
everything happened.
And I understood when I stood up
from that chair after three months,
I am not the same anymore.
And I understood
that I have a very strong mission,
that I have to communicate this experience
to everybody.
And this is how, for me, was born the idea
to have an institute
of immaterial performing arts.
Because thinking about immateriality,
performance is time-based art.
It's not like a painting.
You have the painting on the wall,
the next day it's there.
Performance, if you are missing it,
you only have the memory,
or the story of somebody else telling you,
but you actually missed the whole thing.
So you have to be there.
And in my point,
if you talk about immaterial art,
music is the highest --
absolutely highest art of all,
because it's the most immaterial.
And then after this is performance,
and then everything else.
That's my subjective way.
This institute is going to happen
in Hudson, upstate New York,
and we are trying to build
with Rem Koolhaas, an idea.
And it's very simple.
If you want to get experience,
you have to give me your time.
You have to sign the contract
before you enter the building,
that you will spend there
a full six hours,
you have to give me your word of honor.
It's something so old-fashioned,
but if you don't respect your own
word of honor and you leave before --
that's not my problem.
But it's six hours, the experience.
And then after you finish,
you get a certificate of accomplishment,
so get home and frame it if you want.
(Laughter)
This is orientation hall.
The public comes in, and the first thing
you have to do is dress in lab coats.
It's this importance
of stepping from being
just a viewer into experimenter.
And then you go to the lockers
and you put your watch,
your iPhone, your iPod, your computer
and everything digital, electronic.
And you are getting free time
for yourself for the first time.
Because there is nothing
wrong with technology,
our approach to technology is wrong.
We are losing the time
we have for ourselves.
This is an institute
to actually give you back this time.
So what you do here,
first you start slow walking,
you start slowing down.
You're going back to simplicity.
After slow walking, you're going
to learn how to drink water --
very simple, drinking water
for maybe half an hour.
After this, you're going to
the magnet chamber,
where you're going to create
some magnet streams on your body.
Then after this,
you go to crystal chamber.
After crystal chamber,
you go to eye-gazing chamber,
after eye-gazing chamber, you go to
a chamber where you are lying down.
So it's the three basic positions
of the human body,
sitting, standing and lying.
And slow walking.
And there is a sound chamber.
And then after you've seen all of this,
and prepared yourself
mentally and physically,
then you are ready to see
something with a long duration,
like in immaterial art.
It can be music, it can be opera,
it can be a theater piece,
it can be film, it can be video dance.
You go to the long duration chairs
because now you are comfortable.
In the long duration chairs,
you're transported to the big place
where you're going to see the work.
And if you fall asleep,
which is very possible
because it's been a long day,
you're going to be
transported to the parking lot.
(Laughter)
And you know, sleeping is very important.
In sleeping, you're still receiving art.
So in the parking lot you stay
for a certain amount of time,
and then after this
you just, you know, go back,
you see more of the things you like to see
or go home with your certificate.
So this institute right now is virtual.
Right now, I am just
making my institute in Brazil,
then it's going to be in Australia,
then it's coming here,
to Canada and everywhere.
And this is to experience
a kind of simple method,
how you go back to simplicity
in your own life.
Counting rice will be another thing.
(Laughter)
You know, if you count rice
you can make life, too.
How to count rice for six hours?
It's incredibly important.
You know, you go through this whole range
of being bored, being angry,
being completely frustrated, not finishing
the amount of rice you're counting.
And then this unbelievable
amount of peace you get
when satisfying work is finished --
or counting sand in the desert.
Or having the sound-isolated situation --
that you have headphones,
that you don't hear anything,
and you're just there
together without sound,
with the people experiencing silence,
just the simple silence.
We are always doing things
we like in our life.
And this is why you're not changing.
You do things in life --
it's just nothing happens
if you always do things the same way.
But my method is to do things
I'm afraid of, the things I fear,
the things I don't know,
to go to territory
that nobody's ever been.
And then also to include the failure.
I think failure is important
because if you go,
if you experiment, you can fail.
If you don't go into that area
and you don't fail,
you are actually repeating yourself
over and over again.
And I think that human beings
right now need a change,
and the only change to be made
is a personal level change.
You have to make the change on yourself.
Because the only way
to change consciousness
and to change the world around us,
is to start with yourself.
It's so easy to criticize
how it's different,
the things in the world
and they're not right,
and the governments are corrupted
and there's hunger in the world
and there's wars -- the killing.
But what we do on the personal level --
what is our contribution
to this whole thing?
Can you turn to your neighbor,
the one you don't know,
and look at them for two full minutes
in their eyes, right now?
(Chatter)
I'm asking two minutes
of your time, that's so little.
Breathe slowly, don't try to blink,
don't be self-conscious.
Be relaxed.
And just look a complete
stranger in your eyes, in his eyes.
(Silence)
Thank you for trusting me.
(Applause)
Chris Anderson: Thank you.
Thank you so much.
(Music)
(Applause)
(Applause)
(Music)
(Applause)
(Music)
(Applause)
Chris Anderson: You guys were amazing.
That's amazing.
(Applause)
You just don't hear that every day.
(Laughter)
Usman, the official story is that
you learned to play the guitar
by watching Jimmy Page on YouTube.
Usman Riaz: Yes, that was the first one. And then I --
That was the first thing I learned,
and then I started progressing to other things.
And I started watching Kaki King a lot,
and she would always cite Preston Reed as a big influence,
so then I started watching his videos,
and it's very surreal right now to be --
(Laughter)
(Applause)
CA: Was that piece just now,
that was one of his songs that you learned, or how did that happen?
UR: I'd never learned it before,
but he told me that we would be playing that on stage,
so I was familiar with it, so that's why I had so much more fun learning it.
And it finally happened, so ...
(Laughter)
CA: Preston, from your point of view,
I mean, you invented this like 20 years ago, right?
How does it feel to see someone like this
come along taking your art and doing so much with it?
Preston Reed: It's mind-blowing,
and I feel really proud, really honored.
And he's a wonderful musician, so it's cool.
(Laughter)
CA: I guess, I don't think there is like a one-minute other piece you guys can do?
Can you? Do you jam? Do you have anything else?
PR: We haven't prepared anything.
CA: There isn't. I'll tell you what.
If you have another 30 or 40 seconds,
and you have another 30 or 40 seconds,
and we just see that, I just think --
I can feel it. We want to hear a little more.
And if it goes horribly wrong, no worries.
(Applause)
(Laughter)
(Music)
(Applause)
I think stairs may be
one of the most emotionally
malleable physical elements
that an architect has to work with.
[Small thing. Big idea.]
[David Rockwell on
the Stairs]
At its most basic, a stair is a way
to get from point A to point B
at different elevations.
Stairs have a common language.
Treads, which is the thing
that you walk on.
Riser, which is the vertical element
that separates the two treads.
A lot of stairs have nosings
that create a kind of edge.
And then, the connected piece
is a stringer.
Those pieces, in different forms,
make up all stairs.
I assume stairs came to be
from the first time someone said,
"I want to get to this higher rock
from the lower rock."
People climbed
using whatever was available:
stepped logs, ladders
and natural pathways
that were worn over time.
Some of the earliest staircases,
like the pyramids in Chichén Itzá
or the roads to Mount Tai in China,
were a means of getting
to a higher elevation,
which people sought
for worship or for protection.
As engineering has evolved,
so has what's practical.
Stairs can be made
from all kinds of material.
There are linear stairs,
there are spiraled stairs.
Stairs can be indoors,
they can be outdoors.
They clearly help us in an emergency.
But they're also a form of art
in and of themselves.
As we move across a stairway,
the form dictates our pacing,
our feeling, our safety
and our relationship and engagement
with the space around us.
So for a second, think about stepping down
a gradual, monumental staircase
like the one in front
of the New York Public Library.
From those steps,
you have a view of the street
and all the people around you,
and your walk is slow and steady
because the tread is so wide.
That's a totally different experience
than going down the narrow staircase
to, say, an old pub,
where you spill into the room.
There, you encounter tall risers,
so you move more quickly.
Stairs add enormous drama.
Think about how stairs
signaled a grand entrance
and were the star of that moment.
Stairs can even be heroic.
The staircase that remained standing
after September 11th
and the attack on the World Trade Center
was dubbed the "Survivors' Staircase,"
because it played such a central role
in leading hundreds of people to safety.
But small stairs
can have a huge impact, too.
The stoop is a place
that invites neighbors to gather,
blast music, and watch the city in motion.
It's fascinating to me that you see people
wanting to hang out on the stairs.
I think they fill
a deeply human need we have
to inhabit a space
more than just on the ground plane.
And so if you're able to sit
halfway up there,
you're in a kind of magical place.
Carlos,
the Vietnam vet Marine
who volunteered for three tours
and got shot up in every one.
In 1971, he was medically retired
because he had so much
shrapnel in his body
that he was setting off metal detectors.
For the next 42 years,
he suffered from nightmares,
extreme anxiety in public,
isolation, depression.
He self-medicated with alcohol.
He was married and divorced three times.
Carlos had post-traumatic stress disorder.
Now, I became a psychologist
to help mitigate human suffering,
and for the past 10 years, my target
has been the suffering caused by PTSD,
as experienced by veterans like Carlos.
Until recently, the science of PTSD
just wasn't there.
And so, we didn't know what to do.
We put some veterans on heavy drugs.
Others we hospitalized
and gave generic group therapy,
and others still we simply said to them,
"Just go home and try to forget
about your experiences."
More recently, we've tried therapy dogs,
wilderness retreats --
many things which may
temporarily relieve stress,
but which don't actually eliminate
PTSD symptoms over the long term.
But things have changed.
And I am here to tell you
that we can now eliminate PTSD,
not just manage the symptoms,
and in huge numbers of veterans.
Because new scientific research
has been able to show,
objectively, repeatedly,
which treatments actually
get rid of symptoms and which do not.
Now as it turns out,
the best treatments for PTSD use
many of the very same training principles
that the military uses
in preparing its trainees for war.
Now, making war --
this is something that we are good at.
We humans have been making war
since before we were even fully human.
And since then, we have gone
from using stone and sinew
to developing the most sophisticated
and devastating weapon systems imaginable.
And to enable our warriors
to use these weapons,
we employ the most cutting-edge
training methods.
We are good at making war.
And we are good at training
our warriors to fight.
Yet, when we consider the experience
of the modern-day combat veteran,
we begin to see that we
have not been as good
at preparing them to come home.
Why is that?
Well, our ancestors lived
immersed in conflict,
and they fought right where they lived.
So until only very recently
in our evolutionary history,
there was hardly a need to learn
how to come home from war,
because we never really did.
But thankfully, today,
most of humanity lives
in far more peaceful societies,
and when there is conflict,
we, especially in the United States,
now have the technology to put
our warriors through advanced training,
drop them in to fight
anywhere on the globe
and when they're done,
jet them back to peacetime suburbia.
But just imagine for a moment
what this must feel like.
I've spoken with veterans who've told me
that one day they're in a brutal
firefight in Afghanistan
where they saw carnage and death,
and just three days later,
they found themselves
toting an ice chest
to their kid's soccer game.
"Mindfuck" is the most common term.
(Laughter)
It's the most common term
I've heard to describe that experience.
And that's exactly what that is.
Because while our warriors
spend countless hours training for war,
we've only recently come to understand
that many require training
on how to return to civilian life.
Now, like any training, the best
PTSD treatments require repetition.
In the military,
we don't simply hand trainees
Mark-19 automatic grenade launchers
and say, "Here's the trigger,
here's some ammo and good luck."
No. We train them, on the range
and in specific contexts,
over and over and over
until lifting their weapon
and engaging their target
is so engrained into muscle memory
that it can be performed
without even thinking,
even under the most stressful
conditions you can imagine.
Now, the same holds
for training-based treatments.
The first of these treatments
is cognitive therapy,
and this is a kind
of mental recalibration.
When veterans come home from war,
their way of mentally framing
the world is calibrated
to an immensely
more dangerous environment.
So when you try to overlay that mind frame
onto a peacetime environment,
you get problems.
You begin drowning in worries
about dangers that aren't present.
You begin not trusting family or friends.
Which is not to say there are no
dangers in civilian life; there are.
It's just that the probability
of encountering them
compared to combat
is astronomically lower.
So we never advise veterans
to turn off caution completely.
We do train them, however,
to adjust caution
according to where they are.
If you find yourself
in a bad neighborhood,
you turn it up.
Out to dinner with family?
You turn it way down.
We train veterans to be fiercely rational,
to systematically gauge
the actual statistical probability
of encountering, say, an IED
here in peacetime America.
With enough practice,
those recalibrations stick.
The next of these treatments
is exposure therapy,
and this is a kind of field training,
and the fastest of the proven
effective treatments out there.
You remember Carlos?
This was the treatment that he chose.
And so we started off
by giving him exercises,
for him, challenging ones:
going to a grocery store,
going to a shopping mall,
going to a restaurant,
sitting with his back to the door.
And, critically --
staying in these environments.
Now, at first he was very anxious.
He wanted to sit
where he could scan the room,
where he could plan escape routes,
where he could get his hands
on a makeshift weapon.
And he wanted to leave, but he didn't.
He remembered his training
in the Marine Corps,
and he pushed through his discomfort.
And every time he did this,
his anxiety ratcheted down a little bit,
and then a little bit more
and then a little bit more,
until in the end,
he had effectively relearned
how to sit in a public space
and just enjoy himself.
He also listened to recordings
of his combat experiences,
over and over and over.
He listened until those memories
no longer generated any anxiety.
He processed his memories so much
that his brain no longer needed
to return to those experiences
in his sleep.
And when I spoke with him
a year after treatment had finished,
he told me,
"Doc, this is the first time in 43 years
that I haven't had nightmares."
Now, this is different
than erasing a memory.
Veterans will always remember
their traumatic experiences,
but with enough practice,
those memories are no longer as raw
or as painful as they once were.
They don't feel emotionally
like they just happened yesterday,
and that is an immensely
better place to be.
But it's often difficult.
And, like any training,
it may not work for everybody.
And there are trust issues.
Sometimes I'm asked,
"If you haven't been there, Doc,
how can you help me?"
Which is understandable.
But at the point of returning
to civilian life,
you do not require
somebody who's been there.
You don't require training
for operations on the battlefield;
you require training on how to come home.
For the past 10 years of my work,
I have been exposed to detailed accounts
of the worst experiences
that you can imagine,
daily.
And it hasn't always been easy.
There have been times
where I have just felt my heart break
or that I've absorbed too much.
But these training-based
treatments work so well,
that whatever this work takes out of me,
it puts back even more,
because I see people get better.
I see people's lives transform.
Carlos can now enjoy outings
with his grandchildren,
which is something he couldn't even do
with his own children.
And what's amazing to me
is that after 43 years of suffering,
it only took him 10 weeks
of intense training to get his life back.
And when I spoke with him, he told me,
"I know that I can't get those years back.
But at least now, whatever days
that I have left on this Earth,
I can live them in peace."
He also said, "I hope that these
younger veterans don't wait
to get the help they need."
And that's my hope, too.
Because ...
this life is short,
and if you are fortunate enough
to have survived war
or any kind of traumatic experience,
you owe it to yourself
to live your life well.
And you shouldn't wait
to get the training you need
to make that happen.
Now, the best way of ending
human suffering caused by war
is to never go to war.
But we are just not there
yet as a species.
Until we are,
the mental suffering that we create
in our sons and in our daughters
when we send them off to fight
can be alleviated.
But we must ensure that the science,
the energy level, the value
that we place on sending them off to war
is at the very least mirrored
in how well we prepare them
to come back home to us.
This much, we owe them.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Four years ago, here at TED,
I announced Planet's Mission 1:
to launch a fleet of satellites
that would image
the entire Earth, every day,
and to democratize access to it.
The problem we were trying
to solve was simple.
Satellite imagery you find online is old,
typically years old,
yet human activity was happening
on days and weeks and months,
and you can't fix what you can't see.
We wanted to give people the tools
to see that change and take action.
The beautiful Blue Marble image,
taken by the Apollo 17 astronauts in 1972
had helped humanity become aware
that we're on a fragile planet.
And we wanted to take it
to the next level,
to give people the tools
to take action, to take care of it.
Well, after many
Apollo projects of our own,
launching the largest fleet
of satellites in human history,
we have reached our target.
Today, Planet images
the entire Earth, every single day.
Mission accomplished.
(Applause)
Thank you.
It's taken 21 rocket launches --
this animation makes it look
really simple -- it was not.
And we now have
over 200 satellites in orbit,
downlinking their data to 31 ground
stations we built around the planet.
In total, we get 1.5 million 29-megapixel
images of the Earth down each day.
And on any one location
of the Earth's surface,
we now have on average
more than 500 images.
A deep stack of data,
documenting immense change.
And lots of people are using this imagery.
Agricultural companies are using it
to improve farmers' crop yields.
Consumer-mapping companies are using it
to improve the maps you find online.
Governments are using it
for border security
or helping with disaster response
after floods and fires and earthquakes.
And lots of NGOs are using it.
So, for tracking
and stopping deforestation.
Or helping to find the refugees
fleeing Myanmar.
Or to track all the activities
in the ongoing crisis in Syria,
holding all sides accountable.
And today, I'm pleased
to announce Planet stories.
Anyone can go online to planet.com
open an account and see
all of our imagery online.
It's a bit like Google Earth,
except it's up-to-date imagery,
and you can see back through time.
You can compare any two days
and see the dramatic changes
that happen around our planet.
Or you can create a time lapse
through the 500 images that we have
and see that change
dramatically over time.
And you can share these over social media.
It's pretty cool.
(Applause)
Thank you.
We initially created this tool
for news journalists,
who wanted to get unbiased information
about world events.
But now we've opened it up
for anyone to use,
for nonprofit or personal uses.
And we hope it will give people the tools
to find and see the changes on the planet
and take action.
OK, so humanity now has this database
of information about the planet,
changing over time.
What's our next mission, what's Mission 2?
In short, it's space plus AI.
What we're doing
with artificial intelligence
is finding the objects
in all the satellite images.
The same AI tools that are used
to find cats in videos online
can also be used to find
information on our pictures.
So, imagine if you can say,
this is a ship, this is a tree,
this is a car, this is a road,
this is a building, this is a truck.
And if you could do that
for all of the millions of images
coming down per day,
then you basically create a database
of all the sizable objects
on the planet, every day.
And that database is searchable.
So that's exactly what we're doing.
Here's a prototype, working on our API.
This is Beijing.
So, imagine if we wanted
to count the planes in the airport.
We select the airport,
and it finds the planes in today's image,
and finds the planes
in the whole stack of images before it,
and then outputs this graph of all
the planes in Beijing airport over time.
Of course, you could do this
for all the airports around the world.
And let's look here
in the port of Vancouver.
So, we would do the same,
but this time we would look for vessels.
So, we zoom in on Vancouver,
we select the area,
and we search for ships.
And it outputs where all the ships are.
Now, imagine how useful this would be
to people in coast guards
who are trying to track
and stop illegal fishing.
See, legal fishing vessels
transmit their locations
using AIS beacons.
But we frequently find ships
that are not doing that.
The pictures don't lie.
And so, coast guards could use that
and go and find
those illegal fishing vessels.
And soon we'll add
not just ships and planes
but all the other objects,
and we can output data feeds
of those locations
of all these objects over time
that can be integrated digitally
from people's work flows.
In time, we could get
more sophisticated browsers
that people pull in
from different sources.
But ultimately, I can imagine us
abstracting out the imagery entirely
and just having a queryable
interface to the Earth.
Imagine if we could just ask,
"Hey, how many houses
are there in Pakistan?
Give me a plot of that versus time."
"How many trees are there in the Amazon
and can you tell me the locations
of the trees that have been felled
between this week and last week?"
Wouldn't that be great?
Well, that's what
we're trying to go towards,
and we call it "Queryable Earth."
So, Planet's Mission 1 was
to image the whole planet every day
and make it accessible.
Planet's Mission 2 is to index
all the objects on the planet over time
and make it queryable.
Let me leave you with an analogy.
Google indexed what's on the internet
and made it searchable.
Well, we're indexing what's on the Earth
and making it searchable.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
Getting a college education
is a 20-year investment.
When you're growing up poor,
you're not accustomed
to thinking that far ahead.
Instead, you're thinking about
where you're going to get your next meal
and how your family
is going to pay rent that month.
Besides, my parents
and my friends' parents
seemed to be doing just fine
driving taxis and working as janitors.
It wasn't until I was a teenager
when I realized I didn't
want to do those things.
By then, I was two-thirds of the way
through my education,
and it was almost too late
to turn things around.
When you grow up poor,
you want to be rich.
I was no different.
I'm the second-oldest of seven,
and was raised by a single mother
on government aid
in Queens, New York.
By virtue of growing up low-income,
my siblings and I went
to some of New York City's
most struggling public schools.
I had over 60 absences
when I was in seventh grade,
because I didn't feel like going to class.
My high school had
a 55 percent graduation rate,
and even worse,
only 20 percent of the kids graduating
were college-ready.
When I actually did make it to college,
I told my friend Brennan
how our teachers would always ask us
to raise our hands
if we were going to college.
I was taken aback when Brennan said,
"Karim, I've never been asked
that question before."
It was always, "What college
are you going to?"
Just the way that question is phrased
made it unacceptable for him
not to have gone to college.
Nowadays I get asked a different question.
"How were you able to make it out?"
For years I said I was lucky,
but it's not just luck.
When my older brother and I
graduated from high school
at the very same time
and he later dropped out
of a two-year college,
I wanted to understand why he dropped out
and I kept studying.
It wasn't until I got to Cornell
as a Presidential Research Scholar
that I started to learn about
the very real educational consequences
of being raised by a single mother
on government aid
and attending the schools that I did.
That's when my older brother's trajectory
began to make complete sense to me.
I also learned that our most admirable
education reformers,
people like Arne Duncan,
the former US Secretary of Education,
or Wendy Kopp, the founder
of Teach For America,
had never attended an inner city
public school like I had.
So much of our education reform
is driven by a sympathetic approach,
where people are saying,
"Let's go and help
these poor inner city kids,
or these poor black and Latino kids,"
instead of an empathetic approach,
where someone like me, who had grown up
in this environment, could say,
"I know the adversities that you're facing
and I want to help you overcome them."
Today when I get questions
about how I made it out,
I share that one of the biggest reasons
is that I wasn't ashamed to ask for help.
In a typical middle class
or affluent household,
if a kid is struggling,
there's a good chance that a parent
or a teacher will come to their rescue
even if they don't ask for help.
However, if that same kid
is growing up poor
and doesn't ask for help,
there's a good chance
that no one will help them.
There are virtually
no social safety nets available.
So seven years ago,
I started to reform
our public education system
shaped by my firsthand perspective.
And I started with summer school.
Research tells us that two-thirds
of the achievement gap,
which is the disparity
in educational attainment
between rich kids and poor kids
or black kids and white kids,
could be directly attributed
to the summer learning loss.
In low-income neighborhoods,
kids forget almost three months
of what they learned
during the school year
over the summer.
They return to school in the fall,
and their teachers
spend another two months
reteaching them old material.
That's five months.
The school year in the United States
is only 10 months.
If kids lose five months of learning
every single year,
that's half of their education.
Half.
If kids were in school over the summer,
then they couldn't regress,
but traditional summer school
is poorly designed.
For kids it feels like punishment,
and for teachers
it feels like babysitting.
But how can we expect principals
to execute an effective summer program
when the school year
ends the last week of June
and then summer school starts
just one week later?
There just isn't enough time
to find the right people,
sort out the logistics,
and design an engaging curriculum
that excites kids and teachers.
But what if we created a program
over the summer
that empowered teachers
as teaching coaches
to develop aspiring educators?
What if we empowered
college-educated role models
as teaching fellows
to help kids realize
their college ambitions?
What if empowered high-achieving kids
as mentors to tutor their younger peers
and inspire them
to invest in their education?
What if we empowered all kids as scholars,
asked them what colleges
they were going to,
designed a summer school
they want to attend
to completely eliminate
the summer learning loss
and close two-thirds
of the achievement gap?
By this summer, my team will have served
over 4,000 low-income children,
trained over 300 aspiring teachers
and created more than 1,000 seasonal jobs
across some of New York City's
most disadvantaged neighborhoods.
(Applause)
And our kids are succeeding.
Two years of independent evaluations
tell us that our kids
eliminate the summer learning loss
and make growth of one month in math
and two months in reading.
So instead of returning to school
in the fall three months behind,
they now go back four months ahead in math
and five months ahead in reading.
(Applause)
Ten years ago, if you would have told me
that I'd graduate in the top 10 percent
of my class from an Ivy League institution
and have an opportunity to make a dent
on our public education system
just by tackling two months
of the calendar year,
I would have said,
"Nah. No way."
What's even more exciting
is that if we can prevent
five months of lost time
just by redesigning two months,
imagine the possibilities
that we can unlock
by tackling the rest of the calendar year.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Vision is the most important
and prioritized sense that we have.
We are constantly looking
at the world around us,
and quickly we identify and make sense
of what it is that we see.
Let's just start with an example
of that very fact.
I'm going to show you
a photograph of a person,
just for a second or two,
and I'd like for you to identify
what emotion is on his face.
Ready?
Here you go. Go with your gut reaction.
Okay. What did you see?
Well, we actually surveyed
over 120 individuals,
and the results were mixed.
People did not agree
on what emotion they saw on his face.
Maybe you saw discomfort.
That was the most frequent response
that we received.
But if you asked the person on your left,
they might have said regret or skepticism,
and if you asked somebody on your right,
they might have said
something entirely different,
like hope or empathy.
So we are all looking
at the very same face again.
We might see something
entirely different,
because perception is subjective.
What we think we see
is actually filtered
through our own mind's eye.
Of course, there are many other examples
of how we see the world
through own mind's eye.
I'm going to give you just a few.
So dieters, for instance,
see apples as larger
than people who are not counting calories.
Softball players see the ball as smaller
if they've just come out of a slump,
compared to people who 
had a hot night at the plate.
And actually, our political beliefs also
can affect the way we see other people,
including politicians.
So my research team and I
decided to test this question.
In 2008, Barack Obama
was running for president
for the very first time,
and we surveyed hundreds of Americans
one month before the election.
What we found in this survey
was that some people, some Americans,
think photographs like these
best reflect how Obama really looks.
Of these people, 75 percent
voted for Obama in the actual election.
Other people, though,
thought photographs like these
best reflect how Obama really looks.
89 percent of these people
voted for McCain.
We presented many photographs of Obama
one at a time,
so people did not realize
that what we were changing
from one photograph to the next
was whether we had artificially lightened
or darkened his skin tone.
So how is that possible?
How could it be that
when I look at a person,
an object, or an event,
I see something very different
than somebody else does?
Well, the reasons are many,
but one reason requires that we understand
a little bit more about how our eyes work.
So vision scientists know
that the amount of information
that we can see
at any given point in time,
what we can focus on,
is actually relatively small.
What we can see with great sharpness
and clarity and accuracy
is the equivalent
of the surface area of our thumb
on our outstretched arm.
Everything else around that is blurry,
rendering much of what is presented
to our eyes as ambiguous.
But we have to clarify
and make sense of what it is that we see,
and it's our mind that
helps us fill in that gap.
As a result, perception
is a subjective experience,
and that's how we end up seeing
through our own mind's eye.
So, I'm a social psychologist,
and it's questions like these
that really intrigue me.
I am fascinated by those times
when people do not see eye to eye.
Why is it that somebody might
literally see the glass as half full,
and somebody literally sees it
as half empty?
What is it about what one person
is thinking and feeling
that leads them to see the world
in an entirely different way?
And does that even matter?
So to begin to tackle these questions,
my research team and I
decided to delve deeply
into an issue that has received
international attention:
our health and fitness.
Across the world,
people are struggling
to manage their weight,
and there is a variety of strategies
that we have to help us
keep the pounds off.
For instance, we set
the best of intentions
to exercise after the holidays,
but actually, the majority of Americans
find that their New Year's resolutions
are broken by Valentine's Day.
We talk to ourselves
in very encouraging ways,
telling ourselves this is our year
to get back into shape,
but that is not enough to bring us back
to our ideal weight.
So why?
Of course, there is no simple answer,
but one reason, I argue,
is that our mind's eye
might work against us.
Some people may literally see exercise
as more difficult,
and some people might literally
see exercise as easier.
So, as a first step
to testing these questions,
we gathered objective measurements
of individuals' physical fitness.
We measured the 
circumference of their waist,
compared to the 
circumference of their hips.
A higher waist-to-hip ratio
is an indicator of being
less physically fit
than a lower waist-to-hip ratio.
After gathering these measurements,
we told our participants that
they would walk to a finish line
while carrying extra weight
in a sort of race.
But before they did that,
we asked them to estimate the distance
to the finish line.
We thought that the physical
states of their body
might change how
they perceived the distance.
So what did we find?
Well, waist-to-hip ratio
predicted perceptions of distance.
People who were out of shape and unfit
actually saw the distance
to the finish line
as significantly greater
than people who were in better shape.
People's states of their own body
changed how they
perceived the environment.
But so too can our mind.
In fact, our bodies and our minds
work in tandem
to change how we see the world around us.
That led us to think that maybe people
with strong motivations
and strong goals to exercise
might actually see
the finish line as closer
than people who have weaker motivations.
So to test whether motivations
affect our perceptual
experiences in this way,
we conducted a second study.
Again, we gathered objective measurements
of people's physical fitness,
measuring the circumference of their waist
and the circumference of their hips,
and we had them do a 
few other tests of fitness.
Based on feedback that we gave them,
some of our participants told us
they're not motivated
to exercise any more.
They felt like they already
met their fitness goals
and they weren't going
to do anything else.
These people were not motivated.
Other people, though, 
based on our feedback,
told us they were highly 
motivated to exercise.
They had a strong goal
to make it to the finish line.
But again, before we had them
walk to the finish line,
we had them estimate the distance.
How far away was the finish line?
And again, like the previous study,
we found that waist-to-hip ratio
predicted perceptions of distance.
Unfit individuals saw
the distance as farther,
saw the finish line as farther away,
than people who were in better shape.
Importantly, though, this only happened
for people who were not motivated
to exercise.
On the other hand,
people who were highly
motivated to exercise
saw the distance as short.
Even the most out of shape individuals
saw the finish line
as just as close,
if not slightly closer,
than people who were in better shape.
So our bodies can change
how far away that finish line looks,
but people who had committed
to a manageable goal
that they could accomplish
in the near future
and who believed that they were capable
of meeting that goal
actually saw the exercise as easier.
That led us to wonder,
is there a strategy that we could use
and teach people that would help
change their perceptions of the distance,
help them make exercise look easier?
So we turned to
the vision science literature
to figure out what should we do,
and based on what we read,
we came up with a strategy
that we called, "Keep 
your eyes on the prize."
So this is not the slogan
from an inspirational poster.
It's an actual directive
for how to look around your environment.
People that we trained in this strategy,
we told them to focus
their attention on the finish line,
to avoid looking around,
to imagine a spotlight
was shining on that goal,
and that everything around it was blurry
and perhaps difficult to see.
We thought that this strategy
would help make the exercise look easier.
We compared this group
to a baseline group.
To this group we said,
just look around the environment
as you naturally would.
You will notice the finish line,
but you might also notice
the garbage can off to the right,
or the people and the 
lamp post off to the left.
We thought that people
who used this strategy
would see the distance as farther.
So what did we find?
When we had them estimate the distance,
was this strategy successful
for changing their perceptual experience?
Yes.
People who kept their eyes on the prize
saw the finish line as 30 percent closer
than people who looked around
as they naturally would.
We thought this was great.
We were really excited because it meant
that this strategy helped make
the exercise look easier,
but the big question was,
could this help make exercise
actually better?
Could it improve the quality
of exercise as well?

So next, we told our participants,
you are going to walk to the finish line
while wearing extra weight.
We added weights to their ankles
that amounted to 15 percent
of their body weight.
We told them to lift their knees up high
and walk to the finish line quickly.
We designed this exercise in particular
to be moderately challenging
but not impossible,
like most exercises
that actually improve our fitness.
So the big question, then:
Did keeping your eyes on the prize
and narrowly focusing on the finish line
change their experience of the exercise?
It did.
People who kept their eyes on the prize
told us afterward that it required
17 percent less exertion
for them to do this exercise
than people who looked around naturally.
It changed their subjective experience
of the exercise.
It also changed the objective nature
of their exercise.
People who kept their eyes on the prize
actually moved 23 percent faster
than people who looked around naturally.
To put that in perspective,
a 23 percent increase
is like trading in your
1980 Chevy Citation
for a 1980 Chevrolet Corvette.
We were so excited by this,
because this meant that a strategy
that costs nothing,
that is easy for people to use,
regardless of whether they're in shape
or struggling to get there,
had a big effect.
Keeping your eyes on the prize
made the exercise look and feel easier
even when people were working harder
because they were moving faster.
Now, I know there's more to good health
than walking a little bit faster,
but keeping your eyes on the prize
might be one additional strategy
that you can use to help promote
a healthy lifestyle.
If you're not convinced yet
that we all see the world
through our own mind's eye,
let me leave you with one final example.
Here's a photograph of a beautiful 
street in Stockholm, with two cars.
The car in the back looks much larger
than the car in the front.
However, in reality,
these cars are the same size,
but that's not how we see it.
So does this mean that
our eyes have gone haywire
and that our brains are a mess?
No, it doesn't mean that at all.
It's just how our eyes work.
We might see the world in a different way,
and sometimes that might not
line up with reality,
but it doesn't mean
that one of us is right
and one of us is wrong.
We all see the world
through our mind's eye,
but we can teach ourselves
to see it differently.
So I can think of days
that have gone horribly wrong for me.
I'm fed up, I'm grumpy, I'm tired,
and I'm so behind,
and there's a big black cloud
hanging over my head,
and on days like these,
it looks like everyone around me
is down in the dumps too.
My colleague at work looks annoyed
when I ask for an extension on a deadline,
and my friend looks frustrated
when I show up late for lunch
because a meeting ran long,
and at the end of the day,
my husband looks disappointed
because I'd rather go to 
bed than go to the movies.
And on days like these,
when everybody looks
upset and angry to me,
I try to remind myself that there
are other ways of seeing them.
Perhaps my colleague was confused,
perhaps my friend was concerned,
and perhaps my husband was 
feeling empathy instead.
So we all see the world
through our own mind's eye,
and on some days, it might look
like the world is a dangerous
and challenging and insurmountable place,
but it doesn't have to look
that way all the time.
We can teach ourselves
to see it differently,
and when we find a way to make the world
look nicer and easier,
it might actually become so.
Thank you.
(Applause)
I know what you're thinking.
You think I've lost my way,
and somebody's going to come on the stage in a minute
and guide me gently back to my seat.
(Applause)
I get that all the time in Dubai.
"Here on holiday are you, dear?"
(Laughter)
"Come to visit the children?
How long are you staying?"
Well actually, I hope for a while longer yet.
I have been living and teaching in the Gulf
for over 30 years.
(Applause)
And in that time, I have seen a lot of changes.
Now that statistic
is quite shocking.
And I want to talk to you today
about language loss
and the globalization of English.
I want to tell you about my friend
who was teaching English to adults in Abu Dhabi.
And one fine day,
she decided to take them into the garden
to teach them some nature vocabulary.
But it was she who ended up learning
all the Arabic words for the local plants,
as well as their uses --
medicinal uses, cosmetics,
cooking, herbal.
How did those students get all that knowledge?
Of course, from their grandparents
and even their great-grandparents.
It's not necessary to tell you how important it is
to be able to communicate
across generations.
But sadly, today,
languages are dying
at an unprecedented rate.
A language dies every 14 days.
Now, at the same time,
English is the undisputed global language.
Could there be a connection?
Well I don't know.
But I do know that I've seen a lot of changes.
When I first came out to the Gulf, I came to Kuwait
in the days when it was still a hardship post.
Actually, not that long ago.
That is a little bit too early.
But nevertheless,
I was recruited by the British Council,
along with about 25 other teachers.
And we were the first non-Muslims
to teach in the state schools there in Kuwait.
We were brought to teach English
because the government wanted to modernize the country
and to empower the citizens through education.
And of course, the U.K. benefited
from some of that lovely oil wealth.
Okay.
Now this is the major change that I've seen --
how teaching English
has morphed
from being a mutually beneficial practice
to becoming a massive international business that it is today.
No longer just a foreign language on the school curriculum,
and no longer the sole domain
of mother England,
it has become a bandwagon
for every English-speaking nation on earth.
And why not?
After all, the best education --
according to the latest World University Rankings --
is to be found in the universities
of the U.K. and the U.S.
So everybody wants to have an English education, naturally.
But if you're not a native speaker,
you have to pass a test.
Now can it be right
to reject a student
on linguistic ability alone?
Perhaps you have a computer scientist
who's a genius.
Would he need the same language as a lawyer, for example?
Well, I don't think so.
We English teachers reject them all the time.
We put a stop sign,
and we stop them in their tracks.
They can't pursue their dream any longer,
'til they get English.
Now let me put it this way:
if I met a monolingual Dutch speaker
who had the cure for cancer,
would I stop him from entering my British University?
I don't think so.
But indeed, that is exactly what we do.
We English teachers are the gatekeepers.
And you have to satisfy us first
that your English is good enough.
Now it can be dangerous
to give too much power
to a narrow segment of society.
Maybe the barrier would be too universal.
Okay.
"But," I hear you say,
"what about the research?
It's all in English."
So the books are in English,
the journals are done in English,
but that is a self-fulfilling prophecy.
It feeds the English requirement.
And so it goes on.
I ask you, what happened to translation?
If you think about the Islamic Golden Age,
there was lots of translation then.
They translated from Latin and Greek
into Arabic, into Persian,
and then it was translated on
into the Germanic languages of Europe
and the Romance languages.
And so light shone upon the Dark Ages of Europe.
Now don't get me wrong;
I am not against teaching English,
all you English teachers out there.
I love it that we have a global language.
We need one today more than ever.
But I am against using it
as a barrier.
Do we really want to end up with 600 languages
and the main one being English, or Chinese?
We need more than that. Where do we draw the line?
This system
equates intelligence
with a knowledge of English,
which is quite arbitrary.
(Applause)
And I want to remind you
that the giants upon whose shoulders
today's intelligentsia stand
did not have to have English,
they didn't have to pass an English test.
Case in point, Einstein.
He, by the way, was considered remedial at school
because he was, in fact, dyslexic.
But fortunately for the world,
he did not have to pass an English test.
Because they didn't start until 1964
with TOEFL,
the American test of English.
Now it's exploded.
There are lots and lots of tests of English.
And millions and millions of students
take these tests every year.
Now you might think, you and me,
"Those fees aren't bad, they're okay,"
but they are prohibitive
to so many millions of poor people.
So immediately, we're rejecting them.
(Applause)
It brings to mind a headline I saw recently:
"Education: The Great Divide."
Now I get it,
I understand why people would want to focus on English.
They want to give their children the best chance in life.
And to do that, they need a Western education.
Because, of course, the best jobs
go to people out of the Western Universities,
that I put on earlier.
It's a circular thing.
Okay.
Let me tell you a story about two scientists,
two English scientists.
They were doing an experiment
to do with genetics
and the forelimbs and the hind limbs of animals.
But they couldn't get the results they wanted.
They really didn't know what to do,
until along came a German scientist
who realized that they were using two words
for forelimb and hind limb,
whereas genetics does not differentiate
and neither does German.
So bingo,
problem solved.
If you can't think a thought,
you are stuck.
But if another language can think that thought,
then, by cooperating,
we can achieve and learn so much more.
My daughter
came to England from Kuwait.
She had studied science and mathematics in Arabic.
It's an Arabic-medium school.
She had to translate it into English at her grammar school.
And she was the best in the class
at those subjects.
Which tells us
that when students come to us from abroad,
we may not be giving them enough credit
for what they know,
and they know it in their own language.
When a language dies,
we don't know what we lose with that language.
This is -- I don't know if you saw it on CNN recently --
they gave the Heroes Award
to a young Kenyan shepherd boy
who couldn't study at night in his village,
like all the village children,
because the kerosene lamp,
it had smoke and it damaged his eyes.
And anyway, there was never enough kerosene,
because what does a dollar a day buy for you?
So he invented
a cost-free solar lamp.
And now the children in his village
get the same grades at school
as the children who have electricity at home.
(Applause)
When he received his award,
he said these lovely words:
"The children can lead Africa from what it is today,
a dark continent,
to a light continent."
A simple idea,
but it could have such far-reaching consequences.
People who have no light,
whether it's physical or metaphorical,
cannot pass our exams,
and we can never know what they know.
Let us not keep them and ourselves
in the dark.
Let us celebrate diversity.
Mind your language.
Use it to spread great ideas.
(Applause)
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
What I thought I would do
is I would start with a simple request.
I'd like all of you
to pause for a moment,
you wretched weaklings,
and take stock of your miserable existence.
(Laughter)
Now that was the advice
that St. Benedict gave his rather startled followers
in the fifth century.
It was the advice that I decided to follow myself
when I turned 40.
Up until that moment, I had been that classic corporate warrior --
I was eating too much, I was drinking too much,
I was working too hard
and I was neglecting the family.
And I decided that I would try
and turn my life around.
In particular, I decided
I would try to address the thorny issue
of work-life balance.
So I stepped back from the workforce,
and I spent a year at home
with my wife and four young children.
But all I learned about work-life balance
from that year
was that I found it quite easy
to balance work and life
when I didn't have any work.
(Laughter)
Not a very useful skill,
especially when the money runs out.
So I went back to work,
and I've spent these seven years since
struggling with, studying
and writing about work-life balance.
And I have four observations
I'd like to share with you today.
The first is:
if society's to make any progress on this issue,
we need an honest debate.
But the trouble is
so many people talk so much rubbish
about work-life balance.
All the discussions about flexi-time
or dress-down Fridays
or paternity leave
only serve to mask the core issue,
which is
that certain job and career choices
are fundamentally incompatible
with being meaningfully engaged
on a day-to-day basis
with a young family.
Now the first step in solving any problem
is acknowledging the reality of the situation you're in.
And the reality of the society that we're in
is there are thousands and thousands
of people out there
leading lives of quiet, screaming desperation,
where they work long, hard hours
at jobs they hate
to enable them to buy things they don't need
to impress people they don't like.
(Laughter)
(Applause)
It's my contention that going to work on Friday in jeans and [a] T-shirt
isn't really getting to the nub of the issue.
(Laughter)
The second observation I'd like to make
is we need to face the truth
that governments and corporations
aren't going to solve this issue for us.
We should stop looking outside.
It's up to us as individuals
to take control and responsibility
for the type of lives that we want to lead.
If you don't design your life,
someone else will design it for you,
and you may just not like
their idea of balance.
It's particularly important --
this isn't on the World Wide Web, is it? I'm about to get fired --
it's particularly important
that you never put the quality of your life
in the hands of a commercial corporation.
Now I'm not talking here just about the bad companies --
the "abattoirs of the human soul," as I call them.
(Laughter)
I'm talking about all companies.
Because commercial companies
are inherently designed
to get as much out of you [as]
they can get away with.
It's in their nature; it's in their DNA;
it's what they do --
even the good, well-intentioned companies.
On the one hand,
putting childcare facilities in the workplace
is wonderful and enlightened.
On the other hand, it's a nightmare --
it just means you spend more time at the bloody office.
We have to be responsible
for setting and enforcing
the boundaries that we want in our life.
The third observation is
we have to be careful
with the time frame that we choose
upon which to judge our balance.
Before I went back to work
after my year at home,
I sat down
and I wrote out
a detailed, step-by-step description
of the ideal balanced day
that I aspired to.
And it went like this:
wake up well rested
after a good night's sleep.
Have sex.
Walk the dog.
Have breakfast with my wife and children.
Have sex again.
(Laughter)
Drive the kids to school on the way to the office.
Do three hours' work.
Play a sport with a friend at lunchtime.
Do another three hours' work.
Meet some mates in the pub for an early evening drink.
Drive home for dinner
with my wife and kids.
Meditate for half an hour.
Have sex.
Walk the dog. Have sex again.
Go to bed.
(Applause)
How often do you think I have that day?
(Laughter)
We need to be realistic.
You can't do it all in one day.
We need to elongate the time frame
upon which we judge the balance in our life,
but we need to elongate it
without falling into the trap
of the "I'll have a life when I retire,
when my kids have left home,
when my wife has divorced me, my health is failing,
I've got no mates or interests left."
(Laughter)
A day is too short; "after I retire" is too long.
There's got to be a middle way.
A fourth observation:
We need to approach balance
in a balanced way.
A friend came to see me last year --
and she doesn't mind me telling this story -- a friend came to see me last year
and said, "Nigel, I've read your book.
And I realize that my life is completely out of balance.
It's totally dominated by work.
I work 10 hours a day; I commute two hours a day.
All of my relationships have failed.
There's nothing in my life
apart from my work.
So I've decided to get a grip and sort it out.
So I joined a gym."
(Laughter)
Now I don't mean to mock,
but being a fit 10-hour-a-day office rat
isn't more balanced; it's more fit.
(Laughter)
Lovely though physical exercise may be,
there are other parts to life --
there's the intellectual side; there's the emotional side;
there's the spiritual side.
And to be balanced,
I believe we have to attend
to all of those areas --
not just do 50 stomach crunches.
Now that can be daunting.
Because people say, "Bloody hell mate, I haven't got time to get fit.
You want me to go to church and call my mother."
And I understand.
I truly understand how that can be daunting.
But an incident that happened a couple of years ago
gave me a new perspective.
My wife, who is somewhere in the audience today,
called me up at the office
and said, "Nigel, you need to pick our youngest son" --
Harry -- "up from school."
Because she had to be somewhere else with the other three children for that evening.
So I left work an hour early that afternoon
and picked Harry up at the school gates.
We walked down to the local park,
messed around on the swings, played some silly games.
I then walked him up the hill to the local cafe,
and we shared a pizza for two,
then walked down the hill to our home,
and I gave him his bath
and put him in his Batman pajamas.
I then read him a chapter
of Roald Dahl's "James and the Giant Peach."
I then put him to bed, tucked him in,
gave him a kiss on his forehead and said, "Goodnight, mate,"
and walked out of his bedroom.
As I was walking out of his bedroom,
he said, "Dad?" I went, "Yes, mate?"
He went, "Dad, this has been the best day
of my life, ever."
I hadn't done anything,
hadn't taken him to Disney World or bought him a Playstation.
Now my point is
the small things matter.
Being more balanced
doesn't mean dramatic upheaval in your life.
With the smallest investment
in the right places,
you can radically transform the quality of your relationships
and the quality of your life.
Moreover, I think,
it can transform society.
Because if enough people do it,
we can change society's definition of success
away from the moronically simplistic notion
that the person with the most money when he dies wins,
to a more thoughtful and balanced definition
of what a life well lived looks like.
And that, I think,
is an idea worth spreading.
(Applause)

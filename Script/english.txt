Now...
let's go back in time.
It's 1974.
There is the gallery somewhere
in the world,
and there is a young girl, age 23,
standing in the middle of the space.
In the front of her is a table.
On the table there are 76 objects
for pleasure and for pain.
Some of the objects are
a glass of water, a coat, a shoe, a rose.
But also the knife,
the razor blade, the hammer
and the pistol with one bullet.
There are instructions which say,
"I'm an object.
You can use everything on the table on me.
I'm taking all responsibility --
even killing me.
And the time is six hours."
The beginning of this
performance was easy.
People would give me
the glass of water to drink,
they'd give me the rose.
But very soon after,
there was a man who took the scissors
and cut my clothes,
and then they took the thorns of the rose
and stuck them in my stomach.
Somebody took the razor blade
and cut my neck and drank the blood,
and I still have the scar.
The women would tell the men what to do.
And the men didn't rape me
because it was just a normal opening,
and it was all public,
and they were with their wives.
They carried me around
and put me on the table,
and put the knife between my legs.
And somebody took the pistol and bullet
and put it against my temple.
And another person took the pistol
and they started a fight.
And after six hours were finished,
I...
started walking towards the public.
I was a mess.
I was half-naked, I was full of blood
and tears were running down my face.
And everybody escaped, they just ran away.
They could not confront myself,
with myself as a normal human being.
And then --
what happened
is I went to the hotel,
it was at two in the morning.
And
I looked at myself in the mirror,
and I had a piece of gray hair.
Alright --
please take off your blindfolds.
Welcome to the performance world.
First of all, let's explain
what the performance is.
So many artists,
so many different explanations,
but my explanation
for performance is very simple.
Performance is a mental
and physical construction
that the performer makes
in a specific time
in a space in front of an audience
and then energy dialogue happens.
The audience and the performer
make the piece together.
And the difference between
performance and theater is huge.
In the theater, the knife is not a knife
and the blood is just ketchup.
In the performance,
the blood is the material,
and the razor blade or knife is the tool.
It's all about being there
in the real time,
and you can't rehearse performance,
because you can't do many
of these types of things twice -- ever.
Which is very important,
the performance is --
you know, all human beings
are always afraid of very simple things.
We're afraid of suffering,
we're afraid of pain,
we're afraid of mortality.
So what I'm doing --
I'm staging these kinds of fears
in front of the audience.
I'm using your energy,
and with this energy I can go
and push my body as far as I can.
And then I liberate myself
from these fears.
And I'm your mirror.
If I can do this for myself,
you can do it for you.
After Belgrade, where I was born,
I went to Amsterdam.
And you know, I've been doing performances
since the last 40 years.
And here I met Ulay,
and he was the person
I actually fell in love with.
And we made, for 12 years,
performances together.
You know the knife
and the pistols and the bullets,
I exchange into love and trust.
So to do this kind work
you have to trust the person completely
because this arrow
is pointing to my heart.
So, heart beating and adrenaline
is rushing and so on,
is about trust, is about total trust
to another human being.
Our relationship was 12 years,
and we worked on so many subjects,
both male and female energy.
And as every relationship
comes to an end, ours went too.
We didn't make phone calls
like normal human beings do
and say, you know, "This is over."
We walked the Great Wall
of China to say goodbye.
I started at the Yellow Sea,
and he started from the Gobi Desert.
We walked, each of us, three months,
two and a half thousand kilometers.
It was the mountains, it was difficult.
It was climbing, it was ruins.
It was, you know, going through
the 12 Chinese provinces,
this was before China was open in '87.
And we succeeded to meet in the middle
to say goodbye.
And then our relationship stopped.
And now, it completely changed
how I see the public.
And one very important piece
I made in those days
was "Balkan Baroque."
And this was the time of the Balkan Wars,
and I wanted to create
some very strong, charismatic image,
something that could serve
for any war at any time,
because the Balkan Wars are now finished,
but there's always some war, somewhere.
So here I am washing
two and a half thousand
dead, big, bloody cow bones.
You can't wash the blood,
you never can wash shame off the wars.
So I'm washing this six hours, six days,
and wars are coming off these bones,
and becoming possible --
an unbearable smell.
But then something stays in the memory.
I want to show you the one
who really changed my life,
and this was the performance in MoMa,
which I just recently made.
This performance --
when I said to the curator,
"I'm just going to sit at the chair,
and there will be
an empty chair at the front,
and anybody from the public
can come and sit as long as they want."
The curator said to me,
"That's ridiculous, you know,
this is New York,
this chair will be empty,
nobody has time to sit in front of you."
(Laughter)
But I sit for three months.
And I sit everyday, eight hours --
the opening of the museum --
and 10 hours on Friday
when the museum is open 10 hours,
and I never move.
And I removed the table
and I'm still sitting,
and this changed everything.
This performance,
maybe 10 or 15 years ago --
nothing would have happened.
But the need of people to actually
experience something different,
the public was not anymore the group --
relation was one to one.
I was watching these people,
they would come and sit in front of me,
but they would have to wait
for hours and hours and hours
to get to this position,
and finally, they sit.
And what happened?
They are observed by the other people,
they're photographed,
they're filmed by the camera,
they're observed by me
and they have nowhere to escape
except in themselves.
And that makes a difference.
There was so much pain and loneliness,
there's so much incredible things
when you look in somebody else's eyes,
because in the gaze
with that total stranger,
that you never even say one word --
everything happened.
And I understood when I stood up
from that chair after three months,
I am not the same anymore.
And I understood
that I have a very strong mission,
that I have to communicate this experience
to everybody.
And this is how, for me, was born the idea
to have an institute
of immaterial performing arts.
Because thinking about immateriality,
performance is time-based art.
It's not like a painting.
You have the painting on the wall,
the next day it's there.
Performance, if you are missing it,
you only have the memory,
or the story of somebody else telling you,
but you actually missed the whole thing.
So you have to be there.
And in my point,
if you talk about immaterial art,
music is the highest --
absolutely highest art of all,
because it's the most immaterial.
And then after this is performance,
and then everything else.
That's my subjective way.
This institute is going to happen
in Hudson, upstate New York,
and we are trying to build
with Rem Koolhaas, an idea.
And it's very simple.
If you want to get experience,
you have to give me your time.
You have to sign the contract
before you enter the building,
that you will spend there
a full six hours,
you have to give me your word of honor.
It's something so old-fashioned,
but if you don't respect your own
word of honor and you leave before --
that's not my problem.
But it's six hours, the experience.
And then after you finish,
you get a certificate of accomplishment,
so get home and frame it if you want.
(Laughter)
This is orientation hall.
The public comes in, and the first thing
you have to do is dress in lab coats.
It's this importance
of stepping from being
just a viewer into experimenter.
And then you go to the lockers
and you put your watch,
your iPhone, your iPod, your computer
and everything digital, electronic.
And you are getting free time
for yourself for the first time.
Because there is nothing
wrong with technology,
our approach to technology is wrong.
We are losing the time
we have for ourselves.
This is an institute
to actually give you back this time.
So what you do here,
first you start slow walking,
you start slowing down.
You're going back to simplicity.
After slow walking, you're going
to learn how to drink water --
very simple, drinking water
for maybe half an hour.
After this, you're going to
the magnet chamber,
where you're going to create
some magnet streams on your body.
Then after this,
you go to crystal chamber.
After crystal chamber,
you go to eye-gazing chamber,
after eye-gazing chamber, you go to
a chamber where you are lying down.
So it's the three basic positions
of the human body,
sitting, standing and lying.
And slow walking.
And there is a sound chamber.
And then after you've seen all of this,
and prepared yourself
mentally and physically,
then you are ready to see
something with a long duration,
like in immaterial art.
It can be music, it can be opera,
it can be a theater piece,
it can be film, it can be video dance.
You go to the long duration chairs
because now you are comfortable.
In the long duration chairs,
you're transported to the big place
where you're going to see the work.
And if you fall asleep,
which is very possible
because it's been a long day,
you're going to be
transported to the parking lot.
(Laughter)
And you know, sleeping is very important.
In sleeping, you're still receiving art.
So in the parking lot you stay
for a certain amount of time,
and then after this
you just, you know, go back,
you see more of the things you like to see
or go home with your certificate.
So this institute right now is virtual.
Right now, I am just
making my institute in Brazil,
then it's going to be in Australia,
then it's coming here,
to Canada and everywhere.
And this is to experience
a kind of simple method,
how you go back to simplicity
in your own life.
Counting rice will be another thing.
(Laughter)
You know, if you count rice
you can make life, too.
How to count rice for six hours?
It's incredibly important.
You know, you go through this whole range
of being bored, being angry,
being completely frustrated, not finishing
the amount of rice you're counting.
And then this unbelievable
amount of peace you get
when satisfying work is finished --
or counting sand in the desert.
Or having the sound-isolated situation --
that you have headphones,
that you don't hear anything,
and you're just there
together without sound,
with the people experiencing silence,
just the simple silence.
We are always doing things
we like in our life.
And this is why you're not changing.
You do things in life --
it's just nothing happens
if you always do things the same way.
But my method is to do things
I'm afraid of, the things I fear,
the things I don't know,
to go to territory
that nobody's ever been.
And then also to include the failure.
I think failure is important
because if you go,
if you experiment, you can fail.
If you don't go into that area
and you don't fail,
you are actually repeating yourself
over and over again.
And I think that human beings
right now need a change,
and the only change to be made
is a personal level change.
You have to make the change on yourself.
Because the only way
to change consciousness
and to change the world around us,
is to start with yourself.
It's so easy to criticize
how it's different,
the things in the world
and they're not right,
and the governments are corrupted
and there's hunger in the world
and there's wars -- the killing.
But what we do on the personal level --
what is our contribution
to this whole thing?
Can you turn to your neighbor,
the one you don't know,
and look at them for two full minutes
in their eyes, right now?
(Chatter)
I'm asking two minutes
of your time, that's so little.
Breathe slowly, don't try to blink,
don't be self-conscious.
Be relaxed.
And just look a complete
stranger in your eyes, in his eyes.
(Silence)
Thank you for trusting me.
(Applause)
Chris Anderson: Thank you.
Thank you so much.
(Music)
(Applause)
(Applause)
(Music)
(Applause)
(Music)
(Applause)
Chris Anderson: You guys were amazing.
That's amazing.
(Applause)
You just don't hear that every day.
(Laughter)
Usman, the official story is that
you learned to play the guitar
by watching Jimmy Page on YouTube.
Usman Riaz: Yes, that was the first one. And then I --
That was the first thing I learned,
and then I started progressing to other things.
And I started watching Kaki King a lot,
and she would always cite Preston Reed as a big influence,
so then I started watching his videos,
and it's very surreal right now to be --
(Laughter)
(Applause)
CA: Was that piece just now,
that was one of his songs that you learned, or how did that happen?
UR: I'd never learned it before,
but he told me that we would be playing that on stage,
so I was familiar with it, so that's why I had so much more fun learning it.
And it finally happened, so ...
(Laughter)
CA: Preston, from your point of view,
I mean, you invented this like 20 years ago, right?
How does it feel to see someone like this
come along taking your art and doing so much with it?
Preston Reed: It's mind-blowing,
and I feel really proud, really honored.
And he's a wonderful musician, so it's cool.
(Laughter)
CA: I guess, I don't think there is like a one-minute other piece you guys can do?
Can you? Do you jam? Do you have anything else?
PR: We haven't prepared anything.
CA: There isn't. I'll tell you what.
If you have another 30 or 40 seconds,
and you have another 30 or 40 seconds,
and we just see that, I just think --
I can feel it. We want to hear a little more.
And if it goes horribly wrong, no worries.
(Applause)
(Laughter)
(Music)
(Applause)
I think stairs may be
one of the most emotionally
malleable physical elements
that an architect has to work with.
[Small thing. Big idea.]
[David Rockwell on
the Stairs]
At its most basic, a stair is a way
to get from point A to point B
at different elevations.
Stairs have a common language.
Treads, which is the thing
that you walk on.
Riser, which is the vertical element
that separates the two treads.
A lot of stairs have nosings
that create a kind of edge.
And then, the connected piece
is a stringer.
Those pieces, in different forms,
make up all stairs.
I assume stairs came to be
from the first time someone said,
"I want to get to this higher rock
from the lower rock."
People climbed
using whatever was available:
stepped logs, ladders
and natural pathways
that were worn over time.
Some of the earliest staircases,
like the pyramids in Chichén Itzá
or the roads to Mount Tai in China,
were a means of getting
to a higher elevation,
which people sought
for worship or for protection.
As engineering has evolved,
so has what's practical.
Stairs can be made
from all kinds of material.
There are linear stairs,
there are spiraled stairs.
Stairs can be indoors,
they can be outdoors.
They clearly help us in an emergency.
But they're also a form of art
in and of themselves.
As we move across a stairway,
the form dictates our pacing,
our feeling, our safety
and our relationship and engagement
with the space around us.
So for a second, think about stepping down
a gradual, monumental staircase
like the one in front
of the New York Public Library.
From those steps,
you have a view of the street
and all the people around you,
and your walk is slow and steady
because the tread is so wide.
That's a totally different experience
than going down the narrow staircase
to, say, an old pub,
where you spill into the room.
There, you encounter tall risers,
so you move more quickly.
Stairs add enormous drama.
Think about how stairs
signaled a grand entrance
and were the star of that moment.
Stairs can even be heroic.
The staircase that remained standing
after September 11th
and the attack on the World Trade Center
was dubbed the "Survivors' Staircase,"
because it played such a central role
in leading hundreds of people to safety.
But small stairs
can have a huge impact, too.
The stoop is a place
that invites neighbors to gather,
blast music, and watch the city in motion.
It's fascinating to me that you see people
wanting to hang out on the stairs.
I think they fill
a deeply human need we have
to inhabit a space
more than just on the ground plane.
And so if you're able to sit
halfway up there,
you're in a kind of magical place.
Carlos,
the Vietnam vet Marine
who volunteered for three tours
and got shot up in every one.
In 1971, he was medically retired
because he had so much
shrapnel in his body
that he was setting off metal detectors.
For the next 42 years,
he suffered from nightmares,
extreme anxiety in public,
isolation, depression.
He self-medicated with alcohol.
He was married and divorced three times.
Carlos had post-traumatic stress disorder.
Now, I became a psychologist
to help mitigate human suffering,
and for the past 10 years, my target
has been the suffering caused by PTSD,
as experienced by veterans like Carlos.
Until recently, the science of PTSD
just wasn't there.
And so, we didn't know what to do.
We put some veterans on heavy drugs.
Others we hospitalized
and gave generic group therapy,
and others still we simply said to them,
"Just go home and try to forget
about your experiences."
More recently, we've tried therapy dogs,
wilderness retreats --
many things which may
temporarily relieve stress,
but which don't actually eliminate
PTSD symptoms over the long term.
But things have changed.
And I am here to tell you
that we can now eliminate PTSD,
not just manage the symptoms,
and in huge numbers of veterans.
Because new scientific research
has been able to show,
objectively, repeatedly,
which treatments actually
get rid of symptoms and which do not.
Now as it turns out,
the best treatments for PTSD use
many of the very same training principles
that the military uses
in preparing its trainees for war.
Now, making war --
this is something that we are good at.
We humans have been making war
since before we were even fully human.
And since then, we have gone
from using stone and sinew
to developing the most sophisticated
and devastating weapon systems imaginable.
And to enable our warriors
to use these weapons,
we employ the most cutting-edge
training methods.
We are good at making war.
And we are good at training
our warriors to fight.
Yet, when we consider the experience
of the modern-day combat veteran,
we begin to see that we
have not been as good
at preparing them to come home.
Why is that?
Well, our ancestors lived
immersed in conflict,
and they fought right where they lived.
So until only very recently
in our evolutionary history,
there was hardly a need to learn
how to come home from war,
because we never really did.
But thankfully, today,
most of humanity lives
in far more peaceful societies,
and when there is conflict,
we, especially in the United States,
now have the technology to put
our warriors through advanced training,
drop them in to fight
anywhere on the globe
and when they're done,
jet them back to peacetime suburbia.
But just imagine for a moment
what this must feel like.
I've spoken with veterans who've told me
that one day they're in a brutal
firefight in Afghanistan
where they saw carnage and death,
and just three days later,
they found themselves
toting an ice chest
to their kid's soccer game.
"Mindfuck" is the most common term.
(Laughter)
It's the most common term
I've heard to describe that experience.
And that's exactly what that is.
Because while our warriors
spend countless hours training for war,
we've only recently come to understand
that many require training
on how to return to civilian life.
Now, like any training, the best
PTSD treatments require repetition.
In the military,
we don't simply hand trainees
Mark-19 automatic grenade launchers
and say, "Here's the trigger,
here's some ammo and good luck."
No. We train them, on the range
and in specific contexts,
over and over and over
until lifting their weapon
and engaging their target
is so engrained into muscle memory
that it can be performed
without even thinking,
even under the most stressful
conditions you can imagine.
Now, the same holds
for training-based treatments.
The first of these treatments
is cognitive therapy,
and this is a kind
of mental recalibration.
When veterans come home from war,
their way of mentally framing
the world is calibrated
to an immensely
more dangerous environment.
So when you try to overlay that mind frame
onto a peacetime environment,
you get problems.
You begin drowning in worries
about dangers that aren't present.
You begin not trusting family or friends.
Which is not to say there are no
dangers in civilian life; there are.
It's just that the probability
of encountering them
compared to combat
is astronomically lower.
So we never advise veterans
to turn off caution completely.
We do train them, however,
to adjust caution
according to where they are.
If you find yourself
in a bad neighborhood,
you turn it up.
Out to dinner with family?
You turn it way down.
We train veterans to be fiercely rational,
to systematically gauge
the actual statistical probability
of encountering, say, an IED
here in peacetime America.
With enough practice,
those recalibrations stick.
The next of these treatments
is exposure therapy,
and this is a kind of field training,
and the fastest of the proven
effective treatments out there.
You remember Carlos?
This was the treatment that he chose.
And so we started off
by giving him exercises,
for him, challenging ones:
going to a grocery store,
going to a shopping mall,
going to a restaurant,
sitting with his back to the door.
And, critically --
staying in these environments.
Now, at first he was very anxious.
He wanted to sit
where he could scan the room,
where he could plan escape routes,
where he could get his hands
on a makeshift weapon.
And he wanted to leave, but he didn't.
He remembered his training
in the Marine Corps,
and he pushed through his discomfort.
And every time he did this,
his anxiety ratcheted down a little bit,
and then a little bit more
and then a little bit more,
until in the end,
he had effectively relearned
how to sit in a public space
and just enjoy himself.
He also listened to recordings
of his combat experiences,
over and over and over.
He listened until those memories
no longer generated any anxiety.
He processed his memories so much
that his brain no longer needed
to return to those experiences
in his sleep.
And when I spoke with him
a year after treatment had finished,
he told me,
"Doc, this is the first time in 43 years
that I haven't had nightmares."
Now, this is different
than erasing a memory.
Veterans will always remember
their traumatic experiences,
but with enough practice,
those memories are no longer as raw
or as painful as they once were.
They don't feel emotionally
like they just happened yesterday,
and that is an immensely
better place to be.
But it's often difficult.
And, like any training,
it may not work for everybody.
And there are trust issues.
Sometimes I'm asked,
"If you haven't been there, Doc,
how can you help me?"
Which is understandable.
But at the point of returning
to civilian life,
you do not require
somebody who's been there.
You don't require training
for operations on the battlefield;
you require training on how to come home.
For the past 10 years of my work,
I have been exposed to detailed accounts
of the worst experiences
that you can imagine,
daily.
And it hasn't always been easy.
There have been times
where I have just felt my heart break
or that I've absorbed too much.
But these training-based
treatments work so well,
that whatever this work takes out of me,
it puts back even more,
because I see people get better.
I see people's lives transform.
Carlos can now enjoy outings
with his grandchildren,
which is something he couldn't even do
with his own children.
And what's amazing to me
is that after 43 years of suffering,
it only took him 10 weeks
of intense training to get his life back.
And when I spoke with him, he told me,
"I know that I can't get those years back.
But at least now, whatever days
that I have left on this Earth,
I can live them in peace."
He also said, "I hope that these
younger veterans don't wait
to get the help they need."
And that's my hope, too.
Because ...
this life is short,
and if you are fortunate enough
to have survived war
or any kind of traumatic experience,
you owe it to yourself
to live your life well.
And you shouldn't wait
to get the training you need
to make that happen.
Now, the best way of ending
human suffering caused by war
is to never go to war.
But we are just not there
yet as a species.
Until we are,
the mental suffering that we create
in our sons and in our daughters
when we send them off to fight
can be alleviated.
But we must ensure that the science,
the energy level, the value
that we place on sending them off to war
is at the very least mirrored
in how well we prepare them
to come back home to us.
This much, we owe them.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Four years ago, here at TED,
I announced Planet's Mission 1:
to launch a fleet of satellites
that would image
the entire Earth, every day,
and to democratize access to it.
The problem we were trying
to solve was simple.
Satellite imagery you find online is old,
typically years old,
yet human activity was happening
on days and weeks and months,
and you can't fix what you can't see.
We wanted to give people the tools
to see that change and take action.
The beautiful Blue Marble image,
taken by the Apollo 17 astronauts in 1972
had helped humanity become aware
that we're on a fragile planet.
And we wanted to take it
to the next level,
to give people the tools
to take action, to take care of it.
Well, after many
Apollo projects of our own,
launching the largest fleet
of satellites in human history,
we have reached our target.
Today, Planet images
the entire Earth, every single day.
Mission accomplished.
(Applause)
Thank you.
It's taken 21 rocket launches --
this animation makes it look
really simple -- it was not.
And we now have
over 200 satellites in orbit,
downlinking their data to 31 ground
stations we built around the planet.
In total, we get 1.5 million 29-megapixel
images of the Earth down each day.
And on any one location
of the Earth's surface,
we now have on average
more than 500 images.
A deep stack of data,
documenting immense change.
And lots of people are using this imagery.
Agricultural companies are using it
to improve farmers' crop yields.
Consumer-mapping companies are using it
to improve the maps you find online.
Governments are using it
for border security
or helping with disaster response
after floods and fires and earthquakes.
And lots of NGOs are using it.
So, for tracking
and stopping deforestation.
Or helping to find the refugees
fleeing Myanmar.
Or to track all the activities
in the ongoing crisis in Syria,
holding all sides accountable.
And today, I'm pleased
to announce Planet stories.
Anyone can go online to planet.com
open an account and see
all of our imagery online.
It's a bit like Google Earth,
except it's up-to-date imagery,
and you can see back through time.
You can compare any two days
and see the dramatic changes
that happen around our planet.
Or you can create a time lapse
through the 500 images that we have
and see that change
dramatically over time.
And you can share these over social media.
It's pretty cool.
(Applause)
Thank you.
We initially created this tool
for news journalists,
who wanted to get unbiased information
about world events.
But now we've opened it up
for anyone to use,
for nonprofit or personal uses.
And we hope it will give people the tools
to find and see the changes on the planet
and take action.
OK, so humanity now has this database
of information about the planet,
changing over time.
What's our next mission, what's Mission 2?
In short, it's space plus AI.
What we're doing
with artificial intelligence
is finding the objects
in all the satellite images.
The same AI tools that are used
to find cats in videos online
can also be used to find
information on our pictures.
So, imagine if you can say,
this is a ship, this is a tree,
this is a car, this is a road,
this is a building, this is a truck.
And if you could do that
for all of the millions of images
coming down per day,
then you basically create a database
of all the sizable objects
on the planet, every day.
And that database is searchable.
So that's exactly what we're doing.
Here's a prototype, working on our API.
This is Beijing.
So, imagine if we wanted
to count the planes in the airport.
We select the airport,
and it finds the planes in today's image,
and finds the planes
in the whole stack of images before it,
and then outputs this graph of all
the planes in Beijing airport over time.
Of course, you could do this
for all the airports around the world.
And let's look here
in the port of Vancouver.
So, we would do the same,
but this time we would look for vessels.
So, we zoom in on Vancouver,
we select the area,
and we search for ships.
And it outputs where all the ships are.
Now, imagine how useful this would be
to people in coast guards
who are trying to track
and stop illegal fishing.
See, legal fishing vessels
transmit their locations
using AIS beacons.
But we frequently find ships
that are not doing that.
The pictures don't lie.
And so, coast guards could use that
and go and find
those illegal fishing vessels.
And soon we'll add
not just ships and planes
but all the other objects,
and we can output data feeds
of those locations
of all these objects over time
that can be integrated digitally
from people's work flows.
In time, we could get
more sophisticated browsers
that people pull in
from different sources.
But ultimately, I can imagine us
abstracting out the imagery entirely
and just having a queryable
interface to the Earth.
Imagine if we could just ask,
"Hey, how many houses
are there in Pakistan?
Give me a plot of that versus time."
"How many trees are there in the Amazon
and can you tell me the locations
of the trees that have been felled
between this week and last week?"
Wouldn't that be great?
Well, that's what
we're trying to go towards,
and we call it "Queryable Earth."
So, Planet's Mission 1 was
to image the whole planet every day
and make it accessible.
Planet's Mission 2 is to index
all the objects on the planet over time
and make it queryable.
Let me leave you with an analogy.
Google indexed what's on the internet
and made it searchable.
Well, we're indexing what's on the Earth
and making it searchable.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
Getting a college education
is a 20-year investment.
When you're growing up poor,
you're not accustomed
to thinking that far ahead.
Instead, you're thinking about
where you're going to get your next meal
and how your family
is going to pay rent that month.
Besides, my parents
and my friends' parents
seemed to be doing just fine
driving taxis and working as janitors.
It wasn't until I was a teenager
when I realized I didn't
want to do those things.
By then, I was two-thirds of the way
through my education,
and it was almost too late
to turn things around.
When you grow up poor,
you want to be rich.
I was no different.
I'm the second-oldest of seven,
and was raised by a single mother
on government aid
in Queens, New York.
By virtue of growing up low-income,
my siblings and I went
to some of New York City's
most struggling public schools.
I had over 60 absences
when I was in seventh grade,
because I didn't feel like going to class.
My high school had
a 55 percent graduation rate,
and even worse,
only 20 percent of the kids graduating
were college-ready.
When I actually did make it to college,
I told my friend Brennan
how our teachers would always ask us
to raise our hands
if we were going to college.
I was taken aback when Brennan said,
"Karim, I've never been asked
that question before."
It was always, "What college
are you going to?"
Just the way that question is phrased
made it unacceptable for him
not to have gone to college.
Nowadays I get asked a different question.
"How were you able to make it out?"
For years I said I was lucky,
but it's not just luck.
When my older brother and I
graduated from high school
at the very same time
and he later dropped out
of a two-year college,
I wanted to understand why he dropped out
and I kept studying.
It wasn't until I got to Cornell
as a Presidential Research Scholar
that I started to learn about
the very real educational consequences
of being raised by a single mother
on government aid
and attending the schools that I did.
That's when my older brother's trajectory
began to make complete sense to me.
I also learned that our most admirable
education reformers,
people like Arne Duncan,
the former US Secretary of Education,
or Wendy Kopp, the founder
of Teach For America,
had never attended an inner city
public school like I had.
So much of our education reform
is driven by a sympathetic approach,
where people are saying,
"Let's go and help
these poor inner city kids,
or these poor black and Latino kids,"
instead of an empathetic approach,
where someone like me, who had grown up
in this environment, could say,
"I know the adversities that you're facing
and I want to help you overcome them."
Today when I get questions
about how I made it out,
I share that one of the biggest reasons
is that I wasn't ashamed to ask for help.
In a typical middle class
or affluent household,
if a kid is struggling,
there's a good chance that a parent
or a teacher will come to their rescue
even if they don't ask for help.
However, if that same kid
is growing up poor
and doesn't ask for help,
there's a good chance
that no one will help them.
There are virtually
no social safety nets available.
So seven years ago,
I started to reform
our public education system
shaped by my firsthand perspective.
And I started with summer school.
Research tells us that two-thirds
of the achievement gap,
which is the disparity
in educational attainment
between rich kids and poor kids
or black kids and white kids,
could be directly attributed
to the summer learning loss.
In low-income neighborhoods,
kids forget almost three months
of what they learned
during the school year
over the summer.
They return to school in the fall,
and their teachers
spend another two months
reteaching them old material.
That's five months.
The school year in the United States
is only 10 months.
If kids lose five months of learning
every single year,
that's half of their education.
Half.
If kids were in school over the summer,
then they couldn't regress,
but traditional summer school
is poorly designed.
For kids it feels like punishment,
and for teachers
it feels like babysitting.
But how can we expect principals
to execute an effective summer program
when the school year
ends the last week of June
and then summer school starts
just one week later?
There just isn't enough time
to find the right people,
sort out the logistics,
and design an engaging curriculum
that excites kids and teachers.
But what if we created a program
over the summer
that empowered teachers
as teaching coaches
to develop aspiring educators?
What if we empowered
college-educated role models
as teaching fellows
to help kids realize
their college ambitions?
What if empowered high-achieving kids
as mentors to tutor their younger peers
and inspire them
to invest in their education?
What if we empowered all kids as scholars,
asked them what colleges
they were going to,
designed a summer school
they want to attend
to completely eliminate
the summer learning loss
and close two-thirds
of the achievement gap?
By this summer, my team will have served
over 4,000 low-income children,
trained over 300 aspiring teachers
and created more than 1,000 seasonal jobs
across some of New York City's
most disadvantaged neighborhoods.
(Applause)
And our kids are succeeding.
Two years of independent evaluations
tell us that our kids
eliminate the summer learning loss
and make growth of one month in math
and two months in reading.
So instead of returning to school
in the fall three months behind,
they now go back four months ahead in math
and five months ahead in reading.
(Applause)
Ten years ago, if you would have told me
that I'd graduate in the top 10 percent
of my class from an Ivy League institution
and have an opportunity to make a dent
on our public education system
just by tackling two months
of the calendar year,
I would have said,
"Nah. No way."
What's even more exciting
is that if we can prevent
five months of lost time
just by redesigning two months,
imagine the possibilities
that we can unlock
by tackling the rest of the calendar year.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Vision is the most important
and prioritized sense that we have.
We are constantly looking
at the world around us,
and quickly we identify and make sense
of what it is that we see.
Let's just start with an example
of that very fact.
I'm going to show you
a photograph of a person,
just for a second or two,
and I'd like for you to identify
what emotion is on his face.
Ready?
Here you go. Go with your gut reaction.
Okay. What did you see?
Well, we actually surveyed
over 120 individuals,
and the results were mixed.
People did not agree
on what emotion they saw on his face.
Maybe you saw discomfort.
That was the most frequent response
that we received.
But if you asked the person on your left,
they might have said regret or skepticism,
and if you asked somebody on your right,
they might have said
something entirely different,
like hope or empathy.
So we are all looking
at the very same face again.
We might see something
entirely different,
because perception is subjective.
What we think we see
is actually filtered
through our own mind's eye.
Of course, there are many other examples
of how we see the world
through own mind's eye.
I'm going to give you just a few.
So dieters, for instance,
see apples as larger
than people who are not counting calories.
Softball players see the ball as smaller
if they've just come out of a slump,
compared to people who 
had a hot night at the plate.
And actually, our political beliefs also
can affect the way we see other people,
including politicians.
So my research team and I
decided to test this question.
In 2008, Barack Obama
was running for president
for the very first time,
and we surveyed hundreds of Americans
one month before the election.
What we found in this survey
was that some people, some Americans,
think photographs like these
best reflect how Obama really looks.
Of these people, 75 percent
voted for Obama in the actual election.
Other people, though,
thought photographs like these
best reflect how Obama really looks.
89 percent of these people
voted for McCain.
We presented many photographs of Obama
one at a time,
so people did not realize
that what we were changing
from one photograph to the next
was whether we had artificially lightened
or darkened his skin tone.
So how is that possible?
How could it be that
when I look at a person,
an object, or an event,
I see something very different
than somebody else does?
Well, the reasons are many,
but one reason requires that we understand
a little bit more about how our eyes work.
So vision scientists know
that the amount of information
that we can see
at any given point in time,
what we can focus on,
is actually relatively small.
What we can see with great sharpness
and clarity and accuracy
is the equivalent
of the surface area of our thumb
on our outstretched arm.
Everything else around that is blurry,
rendering much of what is presented
to our eyes as ambiguous.
But we have to clarify
and make sense of what it is that we see,
and it's our mind that
helps us fill in that gap.
As a result, perception
is a subjective experience,
and that's how we end up seeing
through our own mind's eye.
So, I'm a social psychologist,
and it's questions like these
that really intrigue me.
I am fascinated by those times
when people do not see eye to eye.
Why is it that somebody might
literally see the glass as half full,
and somebody literally sees it
as half empty?
What is it about what one person
is thinking and feeling
that leads them to see the world
in an entirely different way?
And does that even matter?
So to begin to tackle these questions,
my research team and I
decided to delve deeply
into an issue that has received
international attention:
our health and fitness.
Across the world,
people are struggling
to manage their weight,
and there is a variety of strategies
that we have to help us
keep the pounds off.
For instance, we set
the best of intentions
to exercise after the holidays,
but actually, the majority of Americans
find that their New Year's resolutions
are broken by Valentine's Day.
We talk to ourselves
in very encouraging ways,
telling ourselves this is our year
to get back into shape,
but that is not enough to bring us back
to our ideal weight.
So why?
Of course, there is no simple answer,
but one reason, I argue,
is that our mind's eye
might work against us.
Some people may literally see exercise
as more difficult,
and some people might literally
see exercise as easier.
So, as a first step
to testing these questions,
we gathered objective measurements
of individuals' physical fitness.
We measured the 
circumference of their waist,
compared to the 
circumference of their hips.
A higher waist-to-hip ratio
is an indicator of being
less physically fit
than a lower waist-to-hip ratio.
After gathering these measurements,
we told our participants that
they would walk to a finish line
while carrying extra weight
in a sort of race.
But before they did that,
we asked them to estimate the distance
to the finish line.
We thought that the physical
states of their body
might change how
they perceived the distance.
So what did we find?
Well, waist-to-hip ratio
predicted perceptions of distance.
People who were out of shape and unfit
actually saw the distance
to the finish line
as significantly greater
than people who were in better shape.
People's states of their own body
changed how they
perceived the environment.
But so too can our mind.
In fact, our bodies and our minds
work in tandem
to change how we see the world around us.
That led us to think that maybe people
with strong motivations
and strong goals to exercise
might actually see
the finish line as closer
than people who have weaker motivations.
So to test whether motivations
affect our perceptual
experiences in this way,
we conducted a second study.
Again, we gathered objective measurements
of people's physical fitness,
measuring the circumference of their waist
and the circumference of their hips,
and we had them do a 
few other tests of fitness.
Based on feedback that we gave them,
some of our participants told us
they're not motivated
to exercise any more.
They felt like they already
met their fitness goals
and they weren't going
to do anything else.
These people were not motivated.
Other people, though, 
based on our feedback,
told us they were highly 
motivated to exercise.
They had a strong goal
to make it to the finish line.
But again, before we had them
walk to the finish line,
we had them estimate the distance.
How far away was the finish line?
And again, like the previous study,
we found that waist-to-hip ratio
predicted perceptions of distance.
Unfit individuals saw
the distance as farther,
saw the finish line as farther away,
than people who were in better shape.
Importantly, though, this only happened
for people who were not motivated
to exercise.
On the other hand,
people who were highly
motivated to exercise
saw the distance as short.
Even the most out of shape individuals
saw the finish line
as just as close,
if not slightly closer,
than people who were in better shape.
So our bodies can change
how far away that finish line looks,
but people who had committed
to a manageable goal
that they could accomplish
in the near future
and who believed that they were capable
of meeting that goal
actually saw the exercise as easier.
That led us to wonder,
is there a strategy that we could use
and teach people that would help
change their perceptions of the distance,
help them make exercise look easier?
So we turned to
the vision science literature
to figure out what should we do,
and based on what we read,
we came up with a strategy
that we called, "Keep 
your eyes on the prize."
So this is not the slogan
from an inspirational poster.
It's an actual directive
for how to look around your environment.
People that we trained in this strategy,
we told them to focus
their attention on the finish line,
to avoid looking around,
to imagine a spotlight
was shining on that goal,
and that everything around it was blurry
and perhaps difficult to see.
We thought that this strategy
would help make the exercise look easier.
We compared this group
to a baseline group.
To this group we said,
just look around the environment
as you naturally would.
You will notice the finish line,
but you might also notice
the garbage can off to the right,
or the people and the 
lamp post off to the left.
We thought that people
who used this strategy
would see the distance as farther.
So what did we find?
When we had them estimate the distance,
was this strategy successful
for changing their perceptual experience?
Yes.
People who kept their eyes on the prize
saw the finish line as 30 percent closer
than people who looked around
as they naturally would.
We thought this was great.
We were really excited because it meant
that this strategy helped make
the exercise look easier,
but the big question was,
could this help make exercise
actually better?
Could it improve the quality
of exercise as well?

So next, we told our participants,
you are going to walk to the finish line
while wearing extra weight.
We added weights to their ankles
that amounted to 15 percent
of their body weight.
We told them to lift their knees up high
and walk to the finish line quickly.
We designed this exercise in particular
to be moderately challenging
but not impossible,
like most exercises
that actually improve our fitness.
So the big question, then:
Did keeping your eyes on the prize
and narrowly focusing on the finish line
change their experience of the exercise?
It did.
People who kept their eyes on the prize
told us afterward that it required
17 percent less exertion
for them to do this exercise
than people who looked around naturally.
It changed their subjective experience
of the exercise.
It also changed the objective nature
of their exercise.
People who kept their eyes on the prize
actually moved 23 percent faster
than people who looked around naturally.
To put that in perspective,
a 23 percent increase
is like trading in your
1980 Chevy Citation
for a 1980 Chevrolet Corvette.
We were so excited by this,
because this meant that a strategy
that costs nothing,
that is easy for people to use,
regardless of whether they're in shape
or struggling to get there,
had a big effect.
Keeping your eyes on the prize
made the exercise look and feel easier
even when people were working harder
because they were moving faster.
Now, I know there's more to good health
than walking a little bit faster,
but keeping your eyes on the prize
might be one additional strategy
that you can use to help promote
a healthy lifestyle.
If you're not convinced yet
that we all see the world
through our own mind's eye,
let me leave you with one final example.
Here's a photograph of a beautiful 
street in Stockholm, with two cars.
The car in the back looks much larger
than the car in the front.
However, in reality,
these cars are the same size,
but that's not how we see it.
So does this mean that
our eyes have gone haywire
and that our brains are a mess?
No, it doesn't mean that at all.
It's just how our eyes work.
We might see the world in a different way,
and sometimes that might not
line up with reality,
but it doesn't mean
that one of us is right
and one of us is wrong.
We all see the world
through our mind's eye,
but we can teach ourselves
to see it differently.
So I can think of days
that have gone horribly wrong for me.
I'm fed up, I'm grumpy, I'm tired,
and I'm so behind,
and there's a big black cloud
hanging over my head,
and on days like these,
it looks like everyone around me
is down in the dumps too.
My colleague at work looks annoyed
when I ask for an extension on a deadline,
and my friend looks frustrated
when I show up late for lunch
because a meeting ran long,
and at the end of the day,
my husband looks disappointed
because I'd rather go to 
bed than go to the movies.
And on days like these,
when everybody looks
upset and angry to me,
I try to remind myself that there
are other ways of seeing them.
Perhaps my colleague was confused,
perhaps my friend was concerned,
and perhaps my husband was 
feeling empathy instead.
So we all see the world
through our own mind's eye,
and on some days, it might look
like the world is a dangerous
and challenging and insurmountable place,
but it doesn't have to look
that way all the time.
We can teach ourselves
to see it differently,
and when we find a way to make the world
look nicer and easier,
it might actually become so.
Thank you.
(Applause)
I know what you're thinking.
You think I've lost my way,
and somebody's going to come on the stage in a minute
and guide me gently back to my seat.
(Applause)
I get that all the time in Dubai.
"Here on holiday are you, dear?"
(Laughter)
"Come to visit the children?
How long are you staying?"
Well actually, I hope for a while longer yet.
I have been living and teaching in the Gulf
for over 30 years.
(Applause)
And in that time, I have seen a lot of changes.
Now that statistic
is quite shocking.
And I want to talk to you today
about language loss
and the globalization of English.
I want to tell you about my friend
who was teaching English to adults in Abu Dhabi.
And one fine day,
she decided to take them into the garden
to teach them some nature vocabulary.
But it was she who ended up learning
all the Arabic words for the local plants,
as well as their uses --
medicinal uses, cosmetics,
cooking, herbal.
How did those students get all that knowledge?
Of course, from their grandparents
and even their great-grandparents.
It's not necessary to tell you how important it is
to be able to communicate
across generations.
But sadly, today,
languages are dying
at an unprecedented rate.
A language dies every 14 days.
Now, at the same time,
English is the undisputed global language.
Could there be a connection?
Well I don't know.
But I do know that I've seen a lot of changes.
When I first came out to the Gulf, I came to Kuwait
in the days when it was still a hardship post.
Actually, not that long ago.
That is a little bit too early.
But nevertheless,
I was recruited by the British Council,
along with about 25 other teachers.
And we were the first non-Muslims
to teach in the state schools there in Kuwait.
We were brought to teach English
because the government wanted to modernize the country
and to empower the citizens through education.
And of course, the U.K. benefited
from some of that lovely oil wealth.
Okay.
Now this is the major change that I've seen --
how teaching English
has morphed
from being a mutually beneficial practice
to becoming a massive international business that it is today.
No longer just a foreign language on the school curriculum,
and no longer the sole domain
of mother England,
it has become a bandwagon
for every English-speaking nation on earth.
And why not?
After all, the best education --
according to the latest World University Rankings --
is to be found in the universities
of the U.K. and the U.S.
So everybody wants to have an English education, naturally.
But if you're not a native speaker,
you have to pass a test.
Now can it be right
to reject a student
on linguistic ability alone?
Perhaps you have a computer scientist
who's a genius.
Would he need the same language as a lawyer, for example?
Well, I don't think so.
We English teachers reject them all the time.
We put a stop sign,
and we stop them in their tracks.
They can't pursue their dream any longer,
'til they get English.
Now let me put it this way:
if I met a monolingual Dutch speaker
who had the cure for cancer,
would I stop him from entering my British University?
I don't think so.
But indeed, that is exactly what we do.
We English teachers are the gatekeepers.
And you have to satisfy us first
that your English is good enough.
Now it can be dangerous
to give too much power
to a narrow segment of society.
Maybe the barrier would be too universal.
Okay.
"But," I hear you say,
"what about the research?
It's all in English."
So the books are in English,
the journals are done in English,
but that is a self-fulfilling prophecy.
It feeds the English requirement.
And so it goes on.
I ask you, what happened to translation?
If you think about the Islamic Golden Age,
there was lots of translation then.
They translated from Latin and Greek
into Arabic, into Persian,
and then it was translated on
into the Germanic languages of Europe
and the Romance languages.
And so light shone upon the Dark Ages of Europe.
Now don't get me wrong;
I am not against teaching English,
all you English teachers out there.
I love it that we have a global language.
We need one today more than ever.
But I am against using it
as a barrier.
Do we really want to end up with 600 languages
and the main one being English, or Chinese?
We need more than that. Where do we draw the line?
This system
equates intelligence
with a knowledge of English,
which is quite arbitrary.
(Applause)
And I want to remind you
that the giants upon whose shoulders
today's intelligentsia stand
did not have to have English,
they didn't have to pass an English test.
Case in point, Einstein.
He, by the way, was considered remedial at school
because he was, in fact, dyslexic.
But fortunately for the world,
he did not have to pass an English test.
Because they didn't start until 1964
with TOEFL,
the American test of English.
Now it's exploded.
There are lots and lots of tests of English.
And millions and millions of students
take these tests every year.
Now you might think, you and me,
"Those fees aren't bad, they're okay,"
but they are prohibitive
to so many millions of poor people.
So immediately, we're rejecting them.
(Applause)
It brings to mind a headline I saw recently:
"Education: The Great Divide."
Now I get it,
I understand why people would want to focus on English.
They want to give their children the best chance in life.
And to do that, they need a Western education.
Because, of course, the best jobs
go to people out of the Western Universities,
that I put on earlier.
It's a circular thing.
Okay.
Let me tell you a story about two scientists,
two English scientists.
They were doing an experiment
to do with genetics
and the forelimbs and the hind limbs of animals.
But they couldn't get the results they wanted.
They really didn't know what to do,
until along came a German scientist
who realized that they were using two words
for forelimb and hind limb,
whereas genetics does not differentiate
and neither does German.
So bingo,
problem solved.
If you can't think a thought,
you are stuck.
But if another language can think that thought,
then, by cooperating,
we can achieve and learn so much more.
My daughter
came to England from Kuwait.
She had studied science and mathematics in Arabic.
It's an Arabic-medium school.
She had to translate it into English at her grammar school.
And she was the best in the class
at those subjects.
Which tells us
that when students come to us from abroad,
we may not be giving them enough credit
for what they know,
and they know it in their own language.
When a language dies,
we don't know what we lose with that language.
This is -- I don't know if you saw it on CNN recently --
they gave the Heroes Award
to a young Kenyan shepherd boy
who couldn't study at night in his village,
like all the village children,
because the kerosene lamp,
it had smoke and it damaged his eyes.
And anyway, there was never enough kerosene,
because what does a dollar a day buy for you?
So he invented
a cost-free solar lamp.
And now the children in his village
get the same grades at school
as the children who have electricity at home.
(Applause)
When he received his award,
he said these lovely words:
"The children can lead Africa from what it is today,
a dark continent,
to a light continent."
A simple idea,
but it could have such far-reaching consequences.
People who have no light,
whether it's physical or metaphorical,
cannot pass our exams,
and we can never know what they know.
Let us not keep them and ourselves
in the dark.
Let us celebrate diversity.
Mind your language.
Use it to spread great ideas.
(Applause)
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
What I thought I would do
is I would start with a simple request.
I'd like all of you
to pause for a moment,
you wretched weaklings,
and take stock of your miserable existence.
(Laughter)
Now that was the advice
that St. Benedict gave his rather startled followers
in the fifth century.
It was the advice that I decided to follow myself
when I turned 40.
Up until that moment, I had been that classic corporate warrior --
I was eating too much, I was drinking too much,
I was working too hard
and I was neglecting the family.
And I decided that I would try
and turn my life around.
In particular, I decided
I would try to address the thorny issue
of work-life balance.
So I stepped back from the workforce,
and I spent a year at home
with my wife and four young children.
But all I learned about work-life balance
from that year
was that I found it quite easy
to balance work and life
when I didn't have any work.
(Laughter)
Not a very useful skill,
especially when the money runs out.
So I went back to work,
and I've spent these seven years since
struggling with, studying
and writing about work-life balance.
And I have four observations
I'd like to share with you today.
The first is:
if society's to make any progress on this issue,
we need an honest debate.
But the trouble is
so many people talk so much rubbish
about work-life balance.
All the discussions about flexi-time
or dress-down Fridays
or paternity leave
only serve to mask the core issue,
which is
that certain job and career choices
are fundamentally incompatible
with being meaningfully engaged
on a day-to-day basis
with a young family.
Now the first step in solving any problem
is acknowledging the reality of the situation you're in.
And the reality of the society that we're in
is there are thousands and thousands
of people out there
leading lives of quiet, screaming desperation,
where they work long, hard hours
at jobs they hate
to enable them to buy things they don't need
to impress people they don't like.
(Laughter)
(Applause)
It's my contention that going to work on Friday in jeans and [a] T-shirt
isn't really getting to the nub of the issue.
(Laughter)
The second observation I'd like to make
is we need to face the truth
that governments and corporations
aren't going to solve this issue for us.
We should stop looking outside.
It's up to us as individuals
to take control and responsibility
for the type of lives that we want to lead.
If you don't design your life,
someone else will design it for you,
and you may just not like
their idea of balance.
It's particularly important --
this isn't on the World Wide Web, is it? I'm about to get fired --
it's particularly important
that you never put the quality of your life
in the hands of a commercial corporation.
Now I'm not talking here just about the bad companies --
the "abattoirs of the human soul," as I call them.
(Laughter)
I'm talking about all companies.
Because commercial companies
are inherently designed
to get as much out of you [as]
they can get away with.
It's in their nature; it's in their DNA;
it's what they do --
even the good, well-intentioned companies.
On the one hand,
putting childcare facilities in the workplace
is wonderful and enlightened.
On the other hand, it's a nightmare --
it just means you spend more time at the bloody office.
We have to be responsible
for setting and enforcing
the boundaries that we want in our life.
The third observation is
we have to be careful
with the time frame that we choose
upon which to judge our balance.
Before I went back to work
after my year at home,
I sat down
and I wrote out
a detailed, step-by-step description
of the ideal balanced day
that I aspired to.
And it went like this:
wake up well rested
after a good night's sleep.
Have sex.
Walk the dog.
Have breakfast with my wife and children.
Have sex again.
(Laughter)
Drive the kids to school on the way to the office.
Do three hours' work.
Play a sport with a friend at lunchtime.
Do another three hours' work.
Meet some mates in the pub for an early evening drink.
Drive home for dinner
with my wife and kids.
Meditate for half an hour.
Have sex.
Walk the dog. Have sex again.
Go to bed.
(Applause)
How often do you think I have that day?
(Laughter)
We need to be realistic.
You can't do it all in one day.
We need to elongate the time frame
upon which we judge the balance in our life,
but we need to elongate it
without falling into the trap
of the "I'll have a life when I retire,
when my kids have left home,
when my wife has divorced me, my health is failing,
I've got no mates or interests left."
(Laughter)
A day is too short; "after I retire" is too long.
There's got to be a middle way.
A fourth observation:
We need to approach balance
in a balanced way.
A friend came to see me last year --
and she doesn't mind me telling this story -- a friend came to see me last year
and said, "Nigel, I've read your book.
And I realize that my life is completely out of balance.
It's totally dominated by work.
I work 10 hours a day; I commute two hours a day.
All of my relationships have failed.
There's nothing in my life
apart from my work.
So I've decided to get a grip and sort it out.
So I joined a gym."
(Laughter)
Now I don't mean to mock,
but being a fit 10-hour-a-day office rat
isn't more balanced; it's more fit.
(Laughter)
Lovely though physical exercise may be,
there are other parts to life --
there's the intellectual side; there's the emotional side;
there's the spiritual side.
And to be balanced,
I believe we have to attend
to all of those areas --
not just do 50 stomach crunches.
Now that can be daunting.
Because people say, "Bloody hell mate, I haven't got time to get fit.
You want me to go to church and call my mother."
And I understand.
I truly understand how that can be daunting.
But an incident that happened a couple of years ago
gave me a new perspective.
My wife, who is somewhere in the audience today,
called me up at the office
and said, "Nigel, you need to pick our youngest son" --
Harry -- "up from school."
Because she had to be somewhere else with the other three children for that evening.
So I left work an hour early that afternoon
and picked Harry up at the school gates.
We walked down to the local park,
messed around on the swings, played some silly games.
I then walked him up the hill to the local cafe,
and we shared a pizza for two,
then walked down the hill to our home,
and I gave him his bath
and put him in his Batman pajamas.
I then read him a chapter
of Roald Dahl's "James and the Giant Peach."
I then put him to bed, tucked him in,
gave him a kiss on his forehead and said, "Goodnight, mate,"
and walked out of his bedroom.
As I was walking out of his bedroom,
he said, "Dad?" I went, "Yes, mate?"
He went, "Dad, this has been the best day
of my life, ever."
I hadn't done anything,
hadn't taken him to Disney World or bought him a Playstation.
Now my point is
the small things matter.
Being more balanced
doesn't mean dramatic upheaval in your life.
With the smallest investment
in the right places,
you can radically transform the quality of your relationships
and the quality of your life.
Moreover, I think,
it can transform society.
Because if enough people do it,
we can change society's definition of success
away from the moronically simplistic notion
that the person with the most money when he dies wins,
to a more thoughtful and balanced definition
of what a life well lived looks like.
And that, I think,
is an idea worth spreading.
(Applause)
This is really a two-hour presentation
I give to high school students,
cut down to three minutes.
And it all started one day
on a plane, on my way to TED,
seven years ago.
And in the seat next to me
was a high school student, a teenager,
and she came from a really poor family.
And she wanted to make
something of her life,
and she asked me a simple little question.
She said, "What leads to success?"
And I felt really badly,
because I couldn't give her a good answer.
So I get off the plane, and I come to TED.
And I think, jeez, I'm in the middle
of a room of successful people!
So why don't I ask them
what helped them succeed,
and pass it on to kids?
So here we are, seven years,
500 interviews later,
and I'm going to tell you
what really leads to success
and makes TEDsters tick.
And the first thing is passion.
Freeman Thomas says,
"I'm driven by my passion."
TEDsters do it for love;
they don't do it for money.
Carol Coletta says, "I would pay
someone to do what I do."
And the interesting thing is:
if you do it for love,
the money comes anyway.
Work! Rupert Murdoch said
to me, "It's all hard work.
Nothing comes easily.
But I have a lot of fun."
Did he say fun? Rupert? Yes!
(Laughter)
TEDsters do have fun working.
And they work hard.
I figured, they're not workaholics.
They're workafrolics.
(Laughter)
Good!
(Applause)
Alex Garden says, "To be successful,
put your nose down in something
and get damn good at it."
There's no magic;
it's practice, practice, practice.
And it's focus.
Norman Jewison said to me,
"I think it all has to do
with focusing yourself on one thing."
And push!
David Gallo says, "Push yourself.
Physically, mentally,
you've got to push, push, push."
You've got to push through shyness
and self-doubt.
Goldie Hawn says,
"I always had self-doubts.
I wasn't good enough;
I wasn't smart enough.
I didn't think I'd make it."
Now it's not always easy to push yourself,
and that's why they invented mothers.
(Laughter)
(Applause)
Frank Gehry said to me,
"My mother pushed me."
(Laughter)
Serve!
Sherwin Nuland says,
"It was a privilege to serve as a doctor."
A lot of kids want to be millionaires.
The first thing I say is:
"OK, well you can't serve yourself;
you've got to serve others
something of value.
Because that's the way
people really get rich."
Ideas!
TEDster Bill Gates says, "I had an idea:
founding the first micro-computer
software company."
I'd say it was a pretty good idea.
And there's no magic to creativity
in coming up with ideas --
it's just doing some very simple things.
And I give lots of evidence.
Persist!
Joe Kraus says,
"Persistence is the number
one reason for our success."
You've got to persist through failure.
You've got to persist through crap!
Which of course means "Criticism,
Rejection, Assholes and Pressure."
(Laughter)
So, the answer to this question is simple:
Pay 4,000 bucks and come to TED.
(Laughter)
Or failing that, do
the eight things -- and trust me,
these are the big eight things
that lead to success.
Thank you TEDsters
for all your interviews!
(Applause)
I design engineering projects
for middle school
and high school students,
often using materials
that are pretty unexpected.
My inspiration comes
from problems in my daily life.
For example,
one time I needed a costume
to go to a comic convention,
but I didn't want to spend too much money,
so I made my own ...
with a light-up crown and skirt.
(Laughter)
Another time,
I was devastated
because my favorite mobile game,
Flappy Bird,
was being taken off the app store.
(Laughter)
So I was faced with the dilemma
to either never update my phone
or never play Flappy Bird again.
(Laughter)
Unhappy with both options,
I did the only thing
that made sense to me.
I made a physical version of Flappy Bird
that could never be
taken off the app store.
(Laughter)
(Music)
(Beeping)
(Music)
(Laughter)
So a few of my friends
were also pretty addicted to the game,
and I invited them to play as well.
(Video) Friend: Ah!
(Laughter)
(Video) Friend: What the heck?
(Laughter)
And they told me that it was
just as infuriating as the original game.
(Laughter)
So I uploaded a demo
of this project online,
and to my surprise it went viral.
It had over two million views
in just a few days.
(Laughter)
And what's more interesting
are people's comments.
A lot of people
wanted to make it their own,
or asked me how it was made.
So this kind of confirmed my idea
that through a creative project,
we can teach people about engineering.
With the money made from the viral video,
we were able to let students
in our classroom
all make their own game in a box.
Although it was pretty challenging,
they learned a lot of new concepts
in engineering and programming.
And they were all eager to learn
so they could finish the game as well.
(Laughter)
So before Flappy Bird Box,
I had the idea of using creative
engineering projects to teach students.
When I was teaching at a middle school,
we asked our students to build a robot
from a standard technology kit.
And I noticed that
a lot of them seemed bored.
Then a few of them
started taking pieces of paper
and decorating their robots.
And then more of them got into it,
and they became
more interested in the project.
So I started looking
for more creative ways
to introduce technology to students.
What I found was that most technology kits
available in school
look a little intimidating.
They're all made of plastic parts
that you can't customize.
On top of that,
they're all very expensive,
costing hundreds of dollars per kit.
So that's certainly not very affordable
for most classroom budgets.
Since I didn't find anything,
I decided to make something on my own.
I started with paper and fabric.
After all, we all played
with those since we were kids,
and they are also pretty cheap
and can be found
anywhere around the house.
And I prototyped a project
where students
can create a light-up creature
using fabric and googly eyes.
They were all helping
each other in classrooms,
and were laughing
and discussing the project.
And most importantly,
they were able to insert
their own creativity into the project.
So because of the success of this project,
I continued to create
more engineering projects
to challenge my students.
And I also started to take
these workshops outside of school
and into the community.
And something really interesting happened.
I noticed a lot of people
from very diverse backgrounds
started coming to our workshops.
And specifically,
there were a lot more women
and minorities than I expected,
and that you wouldn't usually see
at a traditional engineering workshop.
Now take a look at this employee report
at a major technology company in 2016.
Women make up only 19 percent
of the technology workforce.
And underrepresented minorities
make up only four percent.
This statistic might look familiar
if you walked into
a high school robotics club,
or a college engineering class.
Now, there's a wide variety of problems
that contribute to the lack of diversity
in the technology force.
Perhaps one solution could be
to introduce technology to students
through creative projects.
I'm not saying that this
could solve everything,
but it could introduce technology
to people who originally
wouldn't be interested in it
because of how it has been
portrayed and taught in school.
So how do we start to change
the perception of technology?
Most students think
that it's boring or unwelcoming,
so I have always designed projects
following three principles.
First is having a low floor,
and that means this project
is easy to get started.
So take a look at this tutorial.
The first project
we asked students to learn
is to make a circuit on paper.
As you can see, it doesn't
take very long to learn,
and it's pretty easy even for beginners.
And having a low floor also means
that we're removing the financial barrier
that prevents people
from completing a project.
So with paper, copper tape,
lightbulb and a battery,
people can complete this project
for under a dollar.
So second principle
is having a high ceiling.
This means that there's
a lot of room to grow,
and students are
constantly being challenged.
At first it might just be
a light-up creature,
but then you can add sensors
and microcontrollers,
and start to program the creature
to interact with its environment.
(Laughter)
And finally,
the third principle is customization.
This means that we can make
this project relevant to anyone.
That's the beauty
of using everyday materials;
it's very easy to customize
using paper and fabric.
So even if you don't like Flappy Bird,
you can still make your own game.
(Video) Student: So our game
is about Justin Bieber,
because he's been speeding,
and the object is to prevent him
from getting caught by the LAPD --
(Laughter)
(Video) Student:
Yeah, but he's changing so --
we're a part of his posse.
(Laughter)
Thank you.
(Applause)
I'm really excited to share with you
some findings that really surprise me
about what makes companies 
succeed the most,
what factors actually matter the most
for startup success.
I believe that the startup organization
is one of the greatest forms
to make the world a better place.
If you take a group of people 
with the right equity incentives
and organize them in a startup,
you can unlock human potential
in a way never before possible.
You get them to achieve 
unbelievable things.
But if the startup 
organization is so great,
why do so many fail?
That's what I wanted to find out.
I wanted to find out what
actually matters most
for startup success.
And I wanted to try 
to be systematic about it,
avoid some of my instincts
and maybe misperceptions I have
from so many companies
I've seen over the years.
I wanted to know this
because I've been starting businesses
since I was 12 years old
when I sold candy at the bus stop
in junior high school,
to high school, when I made
solar energy devices,
to college, when I made loudspeakers.
And when I graduated from college,
I started software companies.
And 20 years ago,
I started Idealab,
and in the last 20 years,
we started more than 100 companies,
many successes, and many big failures.
We learned a lot from those failures.
So I tried to look across what factors
accounted the most for company
success and failure.
So I looked at these five.
First, the idea.
I used to think that 
the idea was everything.
I named my company Idealab
for how much I worship
the "aha!" moment when you first
come up with the idea.
But then over time,
I came to think that maybe the team,
the execution, adaptability,
that mattered even more than the idea.
I never thought I'd be quoting
boxer Mike Tyson on the TED stage,
but he once said,
"Everybody has a plan, until they get
punched in the face." (Laughter)
And I think that's so true
about business as well.
So much about a team's execution

is its ability to adapt to getting punched
in the face by the customer.
The customer is the true reality.
And that's why I came to think
that the team maybe
was the most important thing.
Then I started looking
at the business model.
Does the company have a very clear path
generating customer revenues?
That started rising to the top
in my thinking
about maybe what mattered
most for success.
Then I looked at the funding.
Sometimes companies received
intense amounts of funding.
Maybe that's the most important thing?
And then of course,
the timing.
Is the idea way too early and
the world's not ready for it?
Is it early, as in, you're in advance
and you have to educate the world?
Is it just right?
Or is it too late, and there's
already too many competitors?
So I tried to look very carefully
at these five factors
across many companies.
And I looked across all 100
Idealab companies,
and 100 non-Idealab companies
to try and come up with 
something scientific about it.
So first, on these Idealab companies,
the top five companies --
Citysearch, CarsDirect, GoTo,
NetZero, Tickets.com --
those all became billion-dollar successes.
And the five companies on the bottom --
Z.com, Insider Pages, MyLife,
Desktop Factory, Peoplelink --
we all had high hopes for,
but didn't succeed.
So I tried to rank across all 
of those attributes
how I felt those companies scored
on each of those dimensions.
And then for non-Idealab companies,
I looked at wild successes,
like Airbnb and Instagram and Uber
and Youtube and LinkedIn.
And some failures:
Webvan, Kozmo, Pets.com
Flooz and Friendster.
The bottom companies had intense funding,
they even had business models
in some cases,
but they didn't succeed.
I tried to look at what factors
actually accounted the most
for success and failure across
all of these companies,
and the results really surprised me.
The number one thing was timing.
Timing accounted for 42 percent
of the difference
between success and failure.
Team and execution came in second,
and the idea,
the differentiability of the idea,
the uniqueness of the idea,
that actually came in third.
Now, this isn't absolutely definitive,
it's not to say that 
the idea isn't important,
but it very much surprised me that
the idea wasn't the most important thing.
Sometimes it mattered more when 
it was actually timed.
The last two, business model and funding,
made sense to me actually.
I think business model
makes sense to be that low
because you can start out
without a business model
and add one later if your customers
are demanding what you're creating.
And funding, I think as well,
if you're underfunded at first
but you're gaining traction,
especially in today's age,
it's very, very easy to get
intense funding.
So now let me give you some specific
examples about each of these.
So take a wild success like Airbnb
that everybody knows about.
Well, that company was famously
passed on by many smart investors
because people thought,
"No one's going to rent out a space
in their home to a stranger."
Of course, people proved that wrong.
But one of the reasons it succeeded,
aside from a good business model,
a good idea, great execution,
is the timing.
That company came out
right during the height of the recession
when people really needed extra money,
and that maybe helped people overcome
their objection to renting out
their own home to a stranger.
Same thing with Uber.
Uber came out,
incredible company,
incredible business model,
great execution, too.
But the timing was so perfect
for their need to get drivers
into the system.
Drivers were looking for extra money;
it was very, very important.
Some of our early successes, Citysearch,
came out when people needed web pages.
GoTo.com, which we announced
actually at TED in 1998,
was when companies were looking for
cost-effective ways to get traffic.
We thought the idea was so great,
but actually, the timing was probably
maybe more important.
And then some of our failures.
We started a company called Z.com,
it was an online entertainment company.
We were so excited about it --
we raised enough money,
we had a great business model,
we even signed incredibly great
Hollywood talent to join the company.
But broadband penetration
was too low in 1999-2000.
It was too hard to watch
video content online,
you had to put codecs in your browser
and do all this stuff,
and the company eventually
went out of business in 2003.
Just two years later,
when the codec problem
was solved by Adobe Flash
and when broadband penetration
crossed 50 percent in America,
YouTube was perfectly timed.
Great idea, but unbelievable timing.
In fact, YouTube didn't even have
a business model when it first started.
It wasn't even certain that 
that would work out.
But that was beautifully, 
beautifully timed.
So what I would say, in summary,
is execution definitely matters a lot.
The idea matters a lot.
But timing might matter even more.
And the best way to really assess timing
is to really look at whether 
consumers are really ready
for what you have to offer them.
And to be really, really honest about it,
not be in denial about
any results that you see,
because if you have something you love,
you want to push it forward,
but you have to be very, very honest
about that factor on timing.
As I said earlier,
I think startups can change the world
and make the world a better place.
I hope some of these insights
can maybe help you
have a slightly higher success ratio,
and thus make something great
come to the world
that wouldn't have happened otherwise.
Thank you very much,
you've been a great audience.
(Applause)
We are drowning in news.
Reuters alone puts out
three and a half million news stories a year.
That's just one source.
My question is: How many of those stories
are actually going to matter in the long run?
That's the idea behind The Long News.
It's a project by The Long Now Foundation,
which was founded by TEDsters including
Kevin Kelly and Stewart Brand.
And what we're looking for is news stories that might still matter
50 or 100 or 10,000 years from now.
And when you look at the news through that filter,
a lot falls by the wayside.
To take the top stories from the A.P. this last year,
is this going to matter in a decade?
Or this?
Or this?
Really?
Is this going to matter in 50 or 100 years?
Okay, that was kind of cool.
(Laughter)
But the top story of this past year was the economy,
and I'm just betting that, sooner or later,
this particular recession is going to be old news.
So, what kind of stories might
make a difference for the future?
Well, let's take science.
Someday, little robots will go
through our bloodstreams fixing things.
That someday is already here if you're a mouse.
Some recent stories:
nanobees zap tumors with real bee venom;
they're sending genes into the brain;
a robot they built that can crawl through the human body.
What about resources? How are we going to feed nine billion people?
We're having trouble feeding six billion today.
As we heard yesterday, there's over a billion people hungry.
Britain will starve without genetically modified crops.
Bill Gates, fortunately, has bet a billion on [agricultural] research.
What about global politics?
The world's going to be very different when and if China sets the agenda,
and they may.
They've overtaken the U.S. as the world's biggest car market,
they've overtaken Germany as the largest exporter,
and they've started doing DNA tests on kids
to choose their careers.
We're finding all kinds of ways to push back the limits of what we know.
Some recent discoveries:
There's an ant colony from Argentina that has now
spread to every continent but Antarctica;
there's a self-directed robot scientist that's made a discovery --
soon, science may no longer need us,
and life may no longer need us either;
a microbe wakes up after 120,000 years.
It seems that with or without us,
life will go on.
But my pick for the top Long News story of this past year
was this one: water found on the moon.
Makes it a lot easier to put a colony up there.
And if NASA doesn't do it, China might,
or somebody in this room might write a big check.
My point is this:
In the long run, some news stories
are more important than others.
(Applause)
One of the most common ways of dividing the world
is into those who believe
and those who don't --
into the religious and the atheists.
And for the last decade or so,
it's been quite clear
what being an atheist means.
There have been some very vocal atheists
who've pointed out,
not just that religion is wrong,
but that it's ridiculous.
These people, many of whom have lived in North Oxford,
have argued --
they've argued that believing in God
is akin to believing in fairies
and essentially that the whole thing
is a childish game.
Now I think it's too easy.
I think it's too easy
to dismiss the whole of religion that way.
And it's as easy as shooting fish in a barrel.
And what I'd like to inaugurate today
is a new way of being an atheist --
if you like, a new version of atheism
we could call Atheism 2.0.
Now what is Atheism 2.0?
Well it starts from a very basic premise:
of course, there's no God.
Of course, there are no deities or supernatural spirits
or angels, etc.
Now let's move on; that's not the end of the story,
that's the very, very beginning.
I'm interested in the kind of constituency
that thinks something along these lines:
that thinks, "I can't believe in any of this stuff.
I can't believe in the doctrines.
I don't think these doctrines are right.
But," a very important but, "I love Christmas carols.
I really like the art of Mantegna.
I really like looking at old churches.
I really like turning the pages of the Old Testament."
Whatever it may be,
you know the kind of thing I'm talking about --
people who are attracted to the ritualistic side,
the moralistic, communal side of religion,
but can't bear the doctrine.
Until now, these people have faced a rather unpleasant choice.
It's almost as though either you accept the doctrine
and then you can have all the nice stuff,
or you reject the doctrine and
you're living in some kind of spiritual wasteland
under the guidance of CNN and Walmart.
So that's a sort of tough choice.
I don't think we have to make that choice.
I think there is an alternative.
I think there are ways --
and I'm being both very respectful and completely impious --
of stealing from religions.
If you don't believe in a religion,
there's nothing wrong with picking and mixing,
with taking out the best sides of religion.
And for me, atheism 2.0
is about both, as I say,
a respectful and an impious way
of going through religions and saying, "What here could we use?"
The secular world is full of holes.
We have secularized badly, I would argue.
And a thorough study of religion
could give us all sorts of insights
into areas of life that are not going too well.
And I'd like to run through a few of these today.
I'd like to kick off by looking at education.
Now education is a field
the secular world really believes in.
When we think about how we're going to make the world a better place,
we think education; that's where we put a lot of money.
Education is going to give us, not only commercial skills, industrial skills,
it's also going to make us better people.
You know the kind of thing a commencement address is, and graduation ceremonies,
those lyrical claims
that education, the process of education -- particularly higher education --
will make us into nobler and better human beings.
That's a lovely idea.
Interesting where it came from.
In the early 19th century,
church attendance in Western Europe
started sliding down very, very sharply, and people panicked.
They asked themselves the following question.
They said, where are people going to find the morality,
where are they going to find guidance,
and where are they going to find sources of consolation?
And influential voices came up with one answer.
They said culture.
It's to culture that we should look
for guidance, for consolation, for morality.
Let's look to the plays of Shakespeare,
the dialogues of Plato, the novels of Jane Austen.
In there, we'll find a lot of the truths
that we might previously have found in the Gospel of Saint John.
Now I think that's a very beautiful idea and a very true idea.
They wanted to replace scripture with culture.
And that's a very plausible idea.
It's also an idea that we have forgotten.
If you went to a top university --
let's say you went to Harvard or Oxford or Cambridge --
and you said, "I've come here
because I'm in search of morality, guidance and consolation;
I want to know how to live,"
they would show you the way to the insane asylum.
This is simply not what our grandest and best institutes of higher learning
are in the business of.
Why? They don't think we need it.
They don't think we are in an urgent need of assistance.
They see us as adults, rational adults.
What we need is information.
We need data, we don't need help.
Now religions start from a very different place indeed.
All religions, all major religions,
at various points call us children.
And like children,
they believe that we are in severe need of assistance.
We're only just holding it together.
Perhaps this is just me, maybe you.
But anyway, we're only just holding it together.
And we need help. Of course, we need help.
And so we need guidance and we need didactic learning.
You know, in the 18th century in the U.K.,
the greatest preacher, greatest religious preacher, was a man called John Wesley,
who went up and down this country delivering sermons,
advising people how they could live.
He delivered sermons on the duties of parents to their children
and children to their parents,
the duties of the rich to the poor and the poor to the rich.
He was trying to tell people how they should live
through the medium of sermons,
the classic medium of delivery of religions.
Now we've given up with the idea of sermons.
If you said to a modern liberal individualist,
"Hey, how about a sermon?"
they'd go, "No, no. I don't need one of those.
I'm an independent, individual person."
What's the difference between a sermon
and our modern, secular mode of delivery, the lecture?
Well a sermon wants to change your life
and a lecture wants to give you a bit of information.
And I think we need to get back to that sermon tradition.
The tradition of sermonizing is hugely valuable,
because we are in need of guidance,
morality and consolation --
and religions know that.
Another point about education:
we tend to believe in the modern secular world
that if you tell someone something once, they'll remember it.
Sit them in a classroom, tell them about Plato
at the age of 20, send them out for a career in management consultancy for 40 years,
and that lesson will stick with them.
Religions go, "Nonsense.
You need to keep repeating the lesson 10 times a day.
So get on your knees and repeat it."
That's what all religions tell us:
"Get on you knees and repeat it 10 or 20 or 15 times a day."
Otherwise our minds are like sieves.
So religions are cultures of repetition.
They circle the great truths again and again and again.
We associate repetition with boredom.
"Give us the new," we're always saying.
"The new is better than the old."
If I said to you, "Okay, we're not going to have new TED.
We're just going to run through all the old ones
and watch them five times because they're so true.
We're going to watch Elizabeth Gilbert five times
because what she says is so clever," you'd feel cheated.
Not so if you're adopting a religious mindset.
The other things that religions do
is to arrange time.
All the major religions give us calendars.
What is a calendar?
A calendar is a way of making sure that across the year
you will bump into certain very important ideas.
In the Catholic chronology, Catholic calendar,
at the end of March you will think about St. Jerome
and his qualities of humility and goodness
and his generosity to the poor.
You won't do that by accident; you will do that because you are guided to do that.
Now we don't think that way.
In the secular world we think, "If an idea is important, I'll bump into it.
I'll just come across it."
Nonsense, says the religious world view.
Religious view says we need calendars, we need to structure time,
we need to synchronize encounters.
This comes across also
in the way in which religions set up rituals
around important feelings.
Take the Moon. It's really important to look at the Moon.
You know, when you look at the Moon,
you think, "I'm really small. What are my problems?"
It sets things into perspective, etc., etc.
We should all look at the Moon a bit more often. We don't.
Why don't we? Well there's nothing to tell us, "Look at the Moon."
But if you're a Zen Buddhist in the middle of September,
you will be ordered out of your home, made to stand on a canonical platform
and made to celebrate the festival of Tsukimi,
where you will be given poems to read
in honor of the Moon and the passage of time
and the frailty of life that it should remind us of.
You'll be handed rice cakes.
And the Moon and the reflection on the Moon
will have a secure place in your heart.
That's very good.
The other thing that religions are really aware of
is: speak well --
I'm not doing a very good job of this here --
but oratory, oratory is absolutely key to religions.
In the secular world, you can come through the university system and be a lousy speaker
and still have a great career.
But the religious world doesn't think that way.
What you're saying needs to be backed up
by a really convincing way of saying it.
So if you go to an African-American Pentecostalist church
in the American South
and you listen to how they talk,
my goodness, they talk well.
After every convincing point, people will go, "Amen, amen, amen."
At the end of a really rousing paragraph, they'll all stand up,
and they'll go, "Thank you Jesus, thank you Christ, thank you Savior."
If we were doing it like they do it --
let's not do it, but if we were to do it --
I would tell you something like, "Culture should replace scripture."
And you would go, "Amen, amen, amen."
And at the end of my talk, you would all stand up
and you would go, "Thank you Plato, thank you Shakespeare, thank you Jane Austen."
And we'd know that we had a real rhythm going.
All right, all right. We're getting there. We're getting there.
(Applause)
The other thing that religions know is we're not just brains,
we are also bodies.
And when they teach us a lesson,
they do it via the body.
So for example,
take the Jewish idea of forgiveness.
Jews are very interested in forgiveness
and how we should start anew and start afresh.
They don't just deliver us sermons on this.
They don't just give us books or words about this.
They tell us to have a bath.
So in Orthodox Jewish communities, every Friday you go to a Mikveh.
You immerse yourself in the water,
and a physical action backs up a philosophical idea.
We don't tend to do that.
Our ideas are in one area and our behavior with our bodies is in another.
Religions are fascinating in the way they try and combine the two.
Let's look at art now.
Now art is something that in the secular world,
we think very highly of. We think art is really, really important.
A lot of our surplus wealth goes to museums, etc.
We sometimes hear it said
that museums are our new cathedrals, or our new churches.
You've heard that saying.
Now I think that the potential is there,
but we've completely let ourselves down.
And the reason we've let ourselves down
is that we're not properly studying
how religions handle art.
The two really bad ideas that are hovering in the modern world
that inhibit our capacity to draw strength from art:
The first idea is that art should be for art's sake --
a ridiculous idea --
an idea that art should live in a hermetic bubble
and should not try to do anything with this troubled world.
I couldn't disagree more.
The other thing that we believe is that art shouldn't explain itself,
that artists shouldn't say what they're up to,
because if they said it, it might destroy the spell
and we might find it too easy.
That's why a very common feeling when you're in a museum --
let's admit it --
is, "I don't know what this is about."
But if we're serious people, we don't admit to that.
But that feeling of puzzlement is structural
to contemporary art.
Now religions have a much saner attitude to art.
They have no trouble telling us what art is about.
Art is about two things in all the major faiths.
Firstly, it's trying to remind you
of what there is to love.
And secondly, it's trying to remind you
of what there is to fear and to hate.
And that's what art is.
Art is a visceral encounter with the most important ideas of your faith.
So as you walk around a church,
or a mosque or a cathedral,
what you're trying to imbibe, what you're imbibing is,
through your eyes, through your senses,
truths that have otherwise come to you through your mind.
Essentially it's propaganda.
Rembrandt is a propagandist
in the Christian view.
Now the word "propaganda" sets off alarm bells.
We think of Hitler, we think of Stalin. Don't, necessarily.
Propaganda is a manner of being didactic in honor of something.
And if that thing is good, there's no problem with it at all.
My view is that museums should take a leaf out of the book of religions.
And they should make sure that when you walk into a museum --
if I was a museum curator,
I would make a room for love, a room for generosity.
All works of art are talking to us about things.
And if we were able to arrange spaces
where we could come across works
where we would be told, use these works of art
to cement these ideas in your mind,
we would get a lot more out of art.
Art would pick up the duty that it used to have
and that we've neglected because of certain mis-founded ideas.
Art should be one of the tools
by which we improve our society.
Art should be didactic.
Let's think of something else.
The people in the modern world, in the secular world,
who are interested in matters of the spirit,
in matters of the mind,
in higher soul-like concerns,
tend to be isolated individuals.
They're poets, they're philosophers, they're photographers, they're filmmakers.
And they tend to be on their own.
They're our cottage industries. They are vulnerable, single people.
And they get depressed and they get sad on their own.
And they don't really change much.
Now think about religions, think about organized religions.
What do organized religions do?
They group together, they form institutions.
And that has all sorts of advantages.
First of all, scale, might.
The Catholic Church pulled in 97 billion dollars last year
according to the Wall Street Journal.
These are massive machines.
They're collaborative, they're branded, they're multinational,
and they're highly disciplined.
These are all very good qualities.
We recognize them in relation to corporations.
And corporations are very like religions in many ways,
except they're right down at the bottom of the pyramid of needs.
They're selling us shoes and cars.
Whereas the people who are selling us the higher stuff --
the therapists, the poets --
are on their own and they have no power,
they have no might.
So religions are the foremost example
of an institution that is fighting for the things of the mind.
Now we may not agree with what religions are trying to teach us,
but we can admire the institutional way
in which they're doing it.
Books alone, books written by lone individuals,
are not going to change anything.
We need to group together.
If you want to change the world, you have to group together, you have to be collaborative.
And that's what religions do.
They are multinational, as I say,
they are branded, they have a clear identity,
so they don't get lost in a busy world.
That's something we can learn from.
I want to conclude.
Really what I want to say
is for many of you who are operating in a range of different fields,
there is something to learn from the example of religion --
even if you don't believe any of it.
If you're involved in anything that's communal,
that involves lots of people getting together,
there are things for you in religion.
If you're involved, say, in a travel industry in any way,
look at pilgrimage.
Look very closely at pilgrimage.
We haven't begun to scratch the surface
of what travel could be
because we haven't looked at what religions do with travel.
If you're in the art world,
look at the example of what religions are doing with art.
And if you're an educator in any way,
again, look at how religions are spreading ideas.
You may not agree with the ideas,
but my goodness, they're highly effective mechanisms for doing so.
So really my concluding point
is you may not agree with religion,
but at the end of the day,
religions are so subtle, so complicated,
so intelligent in many ways
that they're not fit to be abandoned to the religious alone;
they're for all of us.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
Chris Anderson: Now this is actually a courageous talk,
because you're kind of setting up yourself in some ways
to be ridiculed in some quarters.
AB: You can get shot by both sides.
You can get shot by the hard-headed atheists,
and you can get shot by those who fully believe.
CA: Incoming missiles from North Oxford at any moment.
AB: Indeed.
CA: But you left out one aspect of religion
that a lot of people might say
your agenda could borrow from,
which is this sense --
that's actually probably the most important thing to anyone who's religious --
of spiritual experience,
of some kind of connection
with something that's bigger than you are.
Is there any room for that experience in Atheism 2.0?
AB: Absolutely. I, like many of you, meet people
who say things like, "But isn't there something bigger than us,
something else?"
And I say, "Of course." And they say, "So aren't you sort of religious?"
And I go, "No." Why does that sense of mystery,
that sense of the dizzying scale of the universe,
need to be accompanied by a mystical feeling?
Science and just observation
gives us that feeling without it,
so I don't feel the need.
The universe is large and we are tiny,
without the need for further religious superstructure.
So one can have so-called spiritual moments
without belief in the spirit.
CA: Actually, let me just ask a question.
How many people here would say
that religion is important to them?
Is there an equivalent process
by which there's a sort of bridge
between what you're talking about and what you would say to them?
AB: I would say that there are many, many gaps in secular life
and these can be plugged.
It's not as though, as I try to suggest,
it's not as though either you have religion
and then you have to accept all sorts of things,
or you don't have religion
and then you're cut off from all these very good things.
It's so sad that we constantly say,
"I don't believe so I can't have community,
so I'm cut off from morality,
so I can't go on a pilgrimage."
One wants to say, "Nonsense. Why not?"
And that's really the spirit of my talk.
There's so much we can absorb.
Atheism shouldn't cut itself off from the rich sources of religion.
CA: It seems to me that there's plenty of people in the TED community
who are atheists.
But probably most people in the community
certainly don't think that religion is going away any time soon
and want to find the language
to have a constructive dialogue
and to feel like we can actually talk to each other
and at least share some things in common.
Are we foolish to be optimistic
about the possibility of a world
where, instead of religion being the great rallying cry
of divide and war,
that there could be bridging?
AB: No, we need to be polite about differences.
Politeness is a much-overlooked virtue.
It's seen as hypocrisy.
But we need to get to a stage when you're an atheist
and someone says, "Well you know, I did pray the other day,"
you politely ignore it.
You move on.
Because you've agreed on 90 percent of things,
because you have a shared view on so many things,
and you politely differ.
And I think that's what the religious wars of late have ignored.
They've ignored the possibility of harmonious disagreement.
CA: And finally, does this new thing that you're proposing
that's not a religion but something else,
does it need a leader,
and are you volunteering to be the pope?
(Laughter)
AB: Well, one thing that we're all very suspicious of
is individual leaders.
It doesn't need it.
What I've tried to lay out is a framework
and I'm hoping that people can just fill it in.
I've sketched a sort of broad framework.
But wherever you are, as I say, if you're in the travel industry, do that travel bit.
If you're in the communal industry, look at religion and do the communal bit.
So it's a wiki project.
(Laughter)
CA: Alain, thank you for sparking many conversations later.
(Applause)
It was less than a year after September 11,
and I was at the Chicago Tribune
writing about shootings and murders,
and it was leaving me feeling
pretty dark and depressed.
I had done some activism in college,
so I decided to help a local group
hang door knockers against animal testing.
I thought it would be a safe way
to do something positive,
but of course I have the absolute worst luck ever,
and we were all arrested.
Police took this blurry photo of me
holding leaflets as evidence.
My charges were dismissed,
but a few weeks later,
two FBI agents knocked on my door,
and they told me that unless I helped them
by spying on protest groups,
they would put me on a domestic terrorist list.
I'd love to tell you that I didn't flinch,
but I was terrified,
and when my fear subsided,
I became obsessed with finding out
how this happened,
how animal rights and environmental activists
who have never injured anyone
could become the FBI's number one
domestic terrorism threat.
A few years later, I was invited to testify
before Congress about my reporting,
and I told lawmakers that, while everybody
is talking about going green,
some people are risking their lives
to defend forests and to stop oil pipelines.
They're physically putting their bodies on the line
between the whalers' harpoons and the whales.
These are everyday people,
like these protesters in Italy
who spontaneously climbed over
barbed wire fences to rescue beagles
from animal testing.
And these movements have been incredibly effective
and popular,
so in 1985, their opponents made up a new word,
eco-terrorist,
to shift how we view them.
They just made it up.
Now these companies have backed new laws
like the Animal Enterprise Terrorism Act,
which turns activism into terrorism
if it causes a loss of profits.
Now most people never even heard about this law,
including members of Congress.
Less than one percent were in the room
when it passed the House.
The rest were outside at a new memorial.
They were praising Dr. King
as his style of activism was branded as terrorism
if done in the name of animals or the environment.
Supporters say laws like this are needed
for the extremists:
the vandals, the arsonists, the radicals.
But right now, companies like TransCanada
are briefing police in presentations like this one
about how to prosecute nonviolent protesters
as terrorists.
The FBI's training documents on eco-terrorism
are not about violence,
they're about public relations.
Today, in multiple countries,
corporations are pushing new laws
that make it illegal to photograph
animal cruelty on their farms.
The latest was in Idaho just two weeks ago,
and today we released a lawsuit
challenging it as unconstitutional
as a threat to journalism.
The first of these ag-gag prosecutions,
as they're called,
was a young woman named Amy Meyer,
and Amy saw a sick cow being moved
by a bulldozer outside of a slaughterhouse
as she was on the public street.
And Amy did what any of us would:
She filmed it.
When I found out about her story, I wrote about it,
and within 24 hours, it created such an uproar
that the prosecutors just dropped all the charges.
But apparently, even exposing stuff like that
is a threat.
Through the Freedom of Information Act,
I learned that the counter-terrorism unit
has been monitoring my articles
and speeches like this one.
They even included this nice
little write-up of my book.
They described it as "compelling and well-written."
(Applause)
Blurb on the next book, right?
The point of all of this is to make us afraid,
but as a journalist, I have an unwavering faith
in the power of education.
Our best weapon is sunlight.
Dostoevsky wrote that the whole work of man
is to prove he's a man and not a piano key.
Over and over throughout history,
people in power have used fear
to silence the truth and to silence dissent.
It's time we strike a new note.
Thank you.
(Applause)
When I knew I was going to come to speak to you, I thought,
"I gotta call my mother."
I have a little Cuban mother -- she's about that big.
Four feet. Nothing larger than the sum of her figurative parts.
You still with me? (Laughter)
I called her up.
"Hello, how're you doing, baby?"
"Hey, ma, I got to talk to you."
"You're talking to me already. What's the matter?"
I said, "I've got to talk to a bunch of nice people."
"You're always talking to nice people, except when you went
to the White House."
"Ma, don't start!"
And I told her I was coming to TED, and she said,
"What's the problem?"
And I said, "Well, I'm not sure."
I said, "I have to talk to them about stories.
It's 'Technology, Entertainment and Design.'"
And she said, "Well, you design a story when you make it up,
it's entertainment when you tell it,
and you're going to use a microphone."
(Laughter)
I said, "You're a peach, ma. Pop there?"
"What's the matter? The pearls of wisdom
leaping from my lips like lemmings is no good for you?"
(Laughter)
Then my pop got on there.
My pop, he's one of the old souls, you know --
old Cuban man from Camaguey.
Camaguey is a province in Cuba.
He's from Florida.
He was born there in 1924.
He grew up in a bohio of dirt floors,
and the structure was the kind used by the Tainos,
our old Arawak ancestors.
My father is at once quick-witted, wickedly funny,
and then poignancy turns on a dime and leaves you breathless.
"Papi, help."
"I already heard your mother. I think she's right."
(Laughter)
"After what I just told you?"
My whole life, my father's been there.
So we talked for a few minutes, and he said,
"Why don't you tell them what you believe?"
I love that, but we don't have the time.
Good storytelling is crafting a story that someone wants to listen to.
Great story is the art of letting go.
So I'm going to tell you a little story.
Remember, this tradition comes to us
not from the mists of Avalon, back in time, but further still,
before we were scratching out these stories on papyrus,
or we were doing the pictographs on walls in moist, damp caves.
Back then, we had an urge, a need, to tell the story.
When Lexus wants to sell you a car, they're telling you a story.
Have you been watching the commercials?
Because every one of us has this desire, for once -- just once --
to tell our story and have it heard.
There are stories you tell from stages.
There's stories that you may tell
in a small group of people with some good wine.
And there's stories you tell late at night to a friend,
maybe once in your life.
And then there are stories that we whisper into a Stygian darkness.
I'm not telling you that story.
I'm telling you this one.
It's called, "You're Going to Miss Me."
It's about human connection.
My Cuban mother, which I just briefly introduced you to
in that short character sketch,
came to the United States one thousand years ago.
I was born in 19 -- I forget, and I came to this country
with them in the aftermath of the Cuban revolution.
We went from Havana, Cuba to Decatur, Georgia.
And Decatur, Georgia's a small Southern town.
And in that little Southern town, I grew up,
and grew up hearing these stories.
But this story only happened a few years ago.
I called my mom.
It was a Saturday morning.
And I was calling about how to make ajiaco. It's a Cuban meal.
It's delicious. It's savory.
It makes spit froth in the little corners of your mouth --
is that enough? It makes your armpits juicy, you know?
That kind of food, yeah.
This is the sensory part of the program, people.
I called my mother, and she said, "Carmen, I need you to come, please.
I need to go to the mall, and you know your father now,
he takes a nap in the afternoon, and I got to go.
I got an errand to run."
Let me parenthetically pause here and tell you --
Esther, my mother, had stopped driving several years ago,
to the collective relief of the entire city of Atlanta.
Any vehicular outing with that woman from the time I was a young child,
guys, naturally included flashing, blue lights.
But she'd become adept at dodging the boys in blue,
and when she did meet them, oh, she had wonderful, well, rapport.
"Ma'am, did you know that was a light you just ran?"
(Spanish)
"You don't speak English?"
"No."
(Laughter)
But eventually, every dog has its day,
and she ended up in traffic court,
where she bartered with the judge for a discount.
There's a historical marker.
But now she was a septuagenarian, she'd stopped driving.
And that meant that everyone in the family had to sign up
to take her to have her hair dyed, you know,
that peculiar color of blue that matches her polyester pants suit,
you know, same color as the Buick.
Anybody? All right.
Little picks on the legs, where she does her needlepoint, and leaves little loops.
Rockports -- they're for this.
That's why they call them that.
(Laughter)
This is her ensemble.
And this is the woman that wants me to come on a Saturday morning
when I have a lot to do, but it doesn't take long because Cuban guilt is a weighty thing.
I'm not going political on you but ... And so, I go to my mother's.
I show up. She's in the carport.
Of course, they have a carport.
The kind with the corrugated roof, you know.
The Buick's parked outside,
and she's jingling, jangling a pair of keys.
"I got a surprise for you, baby!"
"We taking your car?"
"Not we, I."
And she reaches into her pocket and pulls out a catastrophe.
Somebody's storytelling. Interactive art. You can talk to me.
Oh, a driver's license, a perfectly valid driver's license.
Issued, evidently, by the DMV in her own county of Gwinnett.
Blithering fucking idiots.
(Laughter)
I said, "Is that thing real?"
"I think so."
"Can you even see?"
"I guess I must."
"Oh, Jesus."
She gets into the car -- she's sitting on two phone books.
I can't even make this part up because she's that tiny.
She's engineered an umbrella so she can -- bam! -- slam the door.
Her daughter, me, the village idiot with the ice cream cone
in the middle of her forehead, is still standing there, slack-jawed.
"You coming? You no coming?"
"Oh, my God." I said, "OK, fine. Does pop know you're driving?"
"Are you kidding me?"
"How are you doing it?"
"He's got to sleep sometime."
And so we left my father fast asleep, because I knew he'd kill me
if I let her go by herself, and we get in the car.
Puts it in reverse. Fifty-five out of the driveway, in reverse.
I am buckling in seatbelts from the front.
I'm yanking them in from the back. I'm doing double knots.
I mean, I've got a mouth as dry as the Kalahari Desert.
I've got a white-knuckle grip on the door. You know what I'm talking about?
And she's whistling, and finally I do the kind of
birth breathing -- you know, that one?
Only a couple of women are going uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh. Right.
And I said, "Ma, would you slow down?"
Because now she's picked up the Highway 285,
the perimeter around Atlanta, which encompasses now --
there's seven lanes, she's on all of them, y'all.
I said, "Ma, pick a lane!"
"They give you seven lanes, they expect you to use them."
And there she goes, right.
I don't believe for a minute she has been out and not been stopped.
So, I think, hey, we can talk. It'll be a diversion.
It'll help my breathing. It'll do something for my pulse, maybe.
"Mommy, I know you have been stopped."
"No, no, what you talking about?"
"You have a license. How long have you been driving?"
"Four or five days."
"Yeah. And you haven't been stopped?"
"I did not get a ticket."
I said, "Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, but come on, come on, come on."
"OK, so I stopped at a light
and there's a guy, you know, in the back."
"Would this guy have, like, a blue uniform
and a terrified look on his face?"
"You weren't there, don't start."
"Come on. You got a ticket?"
"No." She explained,
"The man" -- I have to tell you as she did,
because it loses something if I don't, you know --
"he come to the window, and he does a thing like this,
which tells me he's pretty old, you know.
So I look up and I'm thinking,
maybe he's still going to think I'm kind of cute."
"Ma, are you still doing that?"
"If it works, it works, baby.
So, I say, 'Perdon, yo no hablo ingles.'
Well, wouldn't you know, he had been in Honduras for the Peace Corps."
(Laughter)
So he's talking to her, and at some point she says,
"Then, you know, it was it. That was it. It was done."
"Yeah? What?
He gave you a ticket? He didn't give you a ticket? What?"
"No, I look up, and the light, she change."
(Laughter)
You should be terrified.
Now, I don't know if she's toying with me,
kind of like a cat batting back a mouse, batting back a mouse --
left paw, right paw, left paw, right paw --
but by now, we've reached the mall.
Now, you have all been at a mall during the holidays, yes?
Talk to me. Yes. Yes. You can say yes.
Audience: Yes.
Carmen Agra Deedy: All right, then you know that you have now entered parking lot purgatory,
praying to that saint of perpetual availability
that as you join that serpentine line of cars crawling along,
some guy's going to turn on the brake lights
just as you pull up behind him.
But that doesn't happen most of the time, right?
So, first I say, "Ma, why are we here?"
"You mean, like, in the car?"
"No, don't -- why are we here today?
It's Saturday. It's the holidays."
"Because I have to exchange your father's underwear."
Now, see, this is the kind of Machiavellian thinking,
that you really have to -- you know, in my mind, it's a rabbit's warren,
this woman's mind.
Do I want to walk in, because unless I have Ariadne's thread to anchor --
enough metaphors for you? -- somewhere, I may not get out.
But you know.
(Laughter)
"Why do we have to take pop's underwear back now?
And why? What is wrong with his underwear?"
"It will upset you."
"It won't upset me. Why? What? Is something wrong with him?"
"No, no, no. The only thing with him is, he's an idiot.
I sent him to the store, which was my first mistake,
and he went to buy underwear, and he bought the grippers,
and he's supposed to buy the boxers."
"Why?"
"I read it on the Intersnet. You cannot have children."
"Oh, my God!"
(Laughter)
Olivia? Huh? Huh?
By now, we have now crawled another four feet,
and my mother finally says to me, "I knew it, I knew it.
I'm an immigrant. We make a space. What I tell you? Right there."
And she points out the passenger window, and I look out,
and three -- three -- aisles down,
"Look, the Chevy."
You want to laugh, but you don't know --
you're that politically corrected, have you noticed?
Correct the other direction now, it's OK.
"Look, the Chevy -- he's coming this way."
"Mama, mama, mama, wait, wait, wait. The Chevy is three aisles away."
She looks at me like I'm her, you know, her moron child,
the cretin, the one she's got to speak to very slowly and distinctly.
"I know that, honey. Get out of the car
and go stand in the parking space till I get there."
OK, I want a vote. Come on, come on. No, no.
How many of you once in your -- you were a kid, you were an adult --
you stood in a parking space to hold it for someone?
See, we're a secret club with a secret handshake.
(Laughter)
And years of therapy later, we're doing great.
We're doing great. We're doing fine.
Well, I stood up to her.
This is -- you know, you'd think by now I'm -- and still holding?
I said, "No way, ma, you have embarrassed me my entire life."
Of course, her comeback is, "When have I embarrassed you?"
(Spanish)
And she's still talking while she puts the car in park,
hits the emergency brake, opens the door,
and with a spryness astounding in a woman her age,
she jumps out of the car, knocks out the phone books,
and then she walks around --
she's carrying her cheap Kmart purse with her --
around the front of the car.
She has amazing land speed for a woman her age, too.
Before I know it, she has skiddled across the parking lot
and in between the cars, and people behind me, with that kind of
usual religious charity that the holidays bring us, wah-wah wah-wah.
"I'm coming." Italian hand signals follow.
I scoot over. I close the door. I leave the phone books.
This is new and fast, just so you -- are you still with us?
We'll wait for the slow ones. OK.
I start, and this is where a child says to me --
and the story doesn't work if I tell you about her before,
because this is my laconic child.
A brevity, brevity of everything with this child.
You know, she eats small portions.
Language is something to be meted out
in small phonemes, you know -- just little hmm, hmm-hmm.
She carries a mean spiral notebook and a pen.
She wields great power.
She listens, because that's what people who tell stories do first.
But she pauses occasionally and says,
"How do you spell that? What year? OK."
When she writes the expose in about 20 years,
don't believe a word of it.
But this is my daughter, Lauren, my remarkable daughter,
my borderline Asperger's kid.
Bless you, Dr. Watson.
She says, "Ma, you got to look!"
Now, when this kid says I got to look, you know.
But it isn't like I haven't seen this crime scene before.
I grew up with this woman.
I said, "Lauren, you know what, give me a play-by-play. I can't."
"No, mama, you got to look."
I got to look. You got to look.
Don't you want to look?
There she is.
I look in bewildered awe:
she's standing, those Rockports slightly apart, but grounded.
She's holding out that cheap Kmart purse, and she is wielding it.
She's holding back tons of steel with the sheer force
of her little personality, in that crone-ish voice, saying things like,
"Back it up, buddy! No, it's reserved!"
(Laughter)
Ready? Brace yourselves. Here it comes.
"No, my daughter, she's coming in the Buick.
Honey, sit up so they can see you."
Oh, Jesus. Oh, Jesus.
I finally come -- and now, it's the South.
I don't know what part of the country you live in.
I think we all secretly love stories.
We all secretly want our blankie and our Boo Bear.
We want to curl up and say, "Tell it to me, tell it to me.
Come on, honey, tell it to me."
But in the South, we love a good story.
People have pulled aside,
I mean, they've come out of that queue line,
they have popped their trunks, pulled out lawn chairs and cool drinks.
Bets are placed.
"I'm with the little lady. Damn!"
(Laughter)
And she's bringing me in with a slight salsa movement.
She is, after all, Cuban.
I'm thinking, "Accelerator, break. Accelerator, break."
Like you've never thought that in your life? Right? Yeah.
I pull in. I put the car in park.
Engine's still running -- mine, not the car.
I jump out next to her going, "Don't you move!"
"I'm not going anywhere."
She's got front seat in a Greek tragedy.
I come out, and there's Esther.
She's hugging the purse.
"Que?" Which means "what," and so much more.
(Laughter)
"Ma, have you no shame?
People are watching us all around," right?
Now, some of them you've got to make up, people.
Secret of the trade.
Guess what? Some of these stories I sculpt a little, here and there.
Some, they're just right there, right there. Put them right there.
She says this to me.
After I say -- let me refresh you --
"have you no shame?"
"No. I gave it up with pantyhose -- they're both too binding."
(Laughter)
(Applause)
Yeah, you can clap, but then you're about 30 seconds from the end.
I'm about to snap like a brittle twig, when suddenly someone taps me on the shoulder.
Intrepid soul.
I'm thinking, "This is my kid. How dare she?
She jumped out of that car."
That's OK, because my mother yells at me, I yell at her.
It's a beautiful hierarchy, and it works.
(Laughter)
I turn around, but it's not a child. It's a young woman,
a little taller than I, pale green, amused eyes.
With her is a young man -- husband, brother, lover, it's not my job.
And she says, "Pardon me, ma'am" -- that's how we talk down there --
"is that your mother?"
I said, "No, I follow little old women around parking lots
to see if they'll stop. Yes, it's my mother!"
The boy, now, he says. "Well, what my sister meant" --
they look at each other, it's a knowing glance -- "God, she's crazy!"
I said, (Spanish), and the young girl and the young boy say,
"No, no, honey, we just want to know one more thing."
I said, "Look, please, let me take care of her, OK,
because I know her, and believe me, she's like a small atomic weapon,
you know, you just want to handle her really gingerly."
And the girl goes, "I know, but, I mean, I swear to God,
she reminds us of our mother."
I almost miss it.
He turns to her on the heel of his shoe.
It's a half-whisper, "God, I miss her."
They turn then, shoulder to shoulder, and walk away,
lost in their own reverie.
Memories of some maddening woman who was the luck of their DNA draw.
And I turn to Esther, who's rocking on those 'ports, and says,
"You know what, honey?"
"What, ma?"
"I'm going to drive you crazy probably for about 14, 15 more years,
if you're lucky, but after that, honey, you're going to miss me."
(Applause)
(Music)
(Applause)
(Music)
(Applause)
(Music)
(Applause)
(Music)
(Applause)
So I started working
with refugees because I wanted
to make a difference,
and making a difference starts
with telling their stories.
So when I meet refugees,
I always ask them questions.
Who bombed your house?
Who killed your son?
Did the rest of your family make it out alive?
How are you coping
in your life in exile?
But there's one question that always seems to me
to be most revealing, and that is:
What did you take?
What was that most important thing
that you had to take with you
when the bombs were exploding in your town,
and the armed gangs were approaching your house?
A Syrian refugee boy I know
told me that he didn't hesitate
when his life was in imminent danger.
He took his high school diploma,
and later he told me why.
He said, "I took my high school diploma
because my life depended on it."
And he would risk his life to get that diploma.
On his way to school, he would dodge snipers.
His classroom sometimes shook
with the sound of bombs and shelling,
and his mother told me,
"Every day, I would say to him every morning,
'Honey, please don't go to school.'"
And when he insisted, she said,
"I would hug him as if it were for the last time."
But he said to his mother,
"We're all afraid,
but our determination to graduate
is stronger than our fear."
But one day, the family got terrible news.
Hany's aunt, his uncle and his cousin
were murdered in their homes for refusing
to leave their house.
Their throats were slit.
It was time to flee.
They left that day, right away, in their car,
Hany hidden in the back because they were facing
checkpoints of menacing soldiers.
And they would cross the border into Lebanon,
where they would find peace.
But they would begin a life of grueling hardship
and monotony.
They had no choice but to build a shack
on the side of a muddy field,
and this is Hany's brother Ashraf,
who plays outside.
And that day, they joined
the biggest population of refugees in the world,
in a country, Lebanon, that is tiny.
It only has four million citizens,
and there are one million Syrian refugees living there.
There's not a town, a city or a village
that is not host to Syrian refugees.
This is generosity and humanity
that is remarkable.
Think about it this way, proportionately.
It would be as if
the entire population of Germany,
80 million people,
would flee to the United States in just three years.
Half of the entire population of Syria
is now uprooted,
most of them inside the country.
Six and a half million people
have fled for their lives.
Over and well over three million people
have crossed the borders
and have found sanctuary
in the neighboring countries,
and only a small proportion, as you see,
have moved on to Europe.
What I find most worrying
is that half of all Syrian refugees are children.
I took this picture of this little girl.
It was just two hours after she had arrived
after a long trek from Syria into Jordan.
And most troubling of all
is that only 20 percent of 
Syrian refugee children
are in school in Lebanon.
And yet, Syrian refugee children,
all refugee children tell us
education is the most important thing in their lives.
Why? Because it allows them to think of their future
rather than the nightmare of their past.
It allows them to think of hope rather than hatred.
I'm reminded of a recent visit I took
to a Syrian refugee camp in northern Iraq,
and I met this girl,
and I thought, "She's beautiful,"
and I went up to her and asked her,
"Can I take your picture?"
And she said yes,
but she refused to smile.
I think she couldn't,
because I think she must realize that she represents
a lost generation of Syrian refugee children,
a generation isolated and frustrated.
And yet, look at what they fled:
utter destruction,
buildings, industries, schools, roads, homes.
Hany's home was also destroyed.
This will need to be rebuilt
by architects, by engineers, by electricians.
Communities will need teachers and lawyers
and politicians interested in reconciliation
and not revenge.
Shouldn't this be rebuilt
by the people with the largest stake,
the societies in exile, the refugees?
Refugees have a lot of time
to prepare for their return.
You might imagine that being a refugee
is just a temporary state.
Well far from it.
With wars going on and on,
the average time a refugee will spend in exile
is 17 years.
Hany was into his second year in limbo
when I went to visit him recently,
and we conducted our entire conversation in English,
which he confessed to me he learned
from reading all of Dan Brown's novels
and from listening to American rap.
We also spent some nice moments of laughter
and fun with his beloved brother Ashraf.
But I'll never forget what he told me
when we ended our conversation that day.
He said to me,
"If I am not a student, I am nothing."
Hany is one of 50 million people
uprooted in this world today.
Never since World War II
have so many people been forcibly displaced.
So while we're making sweeping progress
in human health,
in technology, in education and design,
we are doing dangerously little
to help the victims
and we are doing far too little
to stop and prevent
the wars that are driving them from their homes.
And there are more and more victims.
Every day, on average,
by the end of this day,
32,000 people will be forcibly displaced
from their homes —
32,000 people.
They flee across borders like this one.
We captured this on the Syrian border to Jordan,
and this is a typical day.
Or they flee on unseaworthy and overcrowded boats,
risking their lives in this case
just to reach safety in Europe.
This Syrian young man
survived one of these boats that capsized —
most of the people drowned —
and he told us,
"Syrians are just looking for a quiet place
where nobody hurts you,
where nobody humiliates you,
and where nobody kills you."
Well, I think that should be the minimum.
How about a place of healing,
of learning,
and even opportunity?
Americans and Europeans
have the impression that proportionally
huge numbers of refugees are coming
to their country,
but the reality is
that 86 percent, the vast majority of refugees,
are living in the developing world,
in countries struggling with their own insecurity,
with their own issues of helping their own populations
and poverty.
So wealthy countries in the world should recognize
the humanity and the generosity of the countries
that are hosting so many refugees.
And all countries should make sure that no one
fleeing war and persecution
arrives at a closed border.
(Applause)
Thank you.
But there is something more that we can do
than just simply helping refugees survive.
We can help them thrive.
We should think of refugee camps and communities
as more than just temporary population centers
where people languish
waiting for the war to end.
Rather, as centers of excellence,
where refugees can triumph over their trauma
and train for the day that they can go home
as agents of positive change
and social transformation.
It makes so much sense,
but I'm reminded of the terrible war in Somalia
that has been raging on for 22 years.
And imagine living in this camp.
I visited this camp.
It's in Djibouti, neighboring Somalia,
and it was so remote
that we had to take a helicopter to fly there.
It was dusty and it was terribly hot.
And we went to visit a school
and started talking to the children,
and then I saw this girl across the room
who looked to me to be the same age
as my own daughter, and I went up and talked to her.
And I asked her the questions
that grown-ups ask kids,
like, "What is your favorite subject?"
and, "What do you want to be when you grow up?"
And this is when her face turned blank,
and she said to me,
"I have no future.
My schooling days are over."
And I thought, there must be some misunderstanding,
so I turned to my colleague
and she confirmed to me
there is no funding for secondary education
in this camp.
And how I wished at that moment
that I could say to her,
"We will build you a school."
And I also thought, what a waste.
She should be and she is
the future of Somalia.
A boy named Jacob Atem
had a different chance, but not before he experienced
terribly tragedy.
He watched — this is in Sudan —
as his village — he was only seven years old —
burned to the ground, and he learned
that his mother and his father
and his entire family
were killed that day.
Only his cousin survived, and the two of them
walked for seven months —
this is boys like him —
chased and pursued by wild
animals and armed gangs,
and they finally made it to refugee camps
where they found safety,
and he would spend the next seven years
in Kenya in a refugee camp.
But his life changed
when he got the chance to be resettled
to the United States,
and he found love in a foster family
and he was able to go to school,
and he wanted me to share with you
this proud moment
when he graduated from university.
(Applause)
I spoke to him on Skype the other day,
and he was in his new university in Florida
pursuing his Ph.D. in public health,
and he proudly told me how he was able to raise
enough funds from the American public
to establish a health clinic back in his village
back home.
So I want to take you back to Hany.
When I told him I was going to have the chance
to speak to you here on the TED stage,
he allowed me to read you a poem
that he sent in an email to me.
He wrote:
"I miss myself,
my friends,
times of reading novels or writing poems,
birds and tea in the morning.
My room, my books, myself,
and everything that was making me smile.
Oh, oh, I had so many dreams
that were about to be realized."
So here is my point:
Not investing in refugees
is a huge missed opportunity.
Leave them abandoned,
and they risk exploitation and abuse,
and leave them unskilled and uneducated,
and delay by years the return
to peace and prosperity in their countries.
I believe how we treat the uprooted
will shape the future of our world.
The victims of war can hold the keys
to lasting peace,
and it's the refugees
who can stop the cycle of violence.
Hany is at a tipping point.
We would love to help him go to university
and to become an engineer,
but our funds are prioritized for the basics in life:
tents and blankets and mattresses and kitchen sets,
food rations and a bit of medicine.
University is a luxury.
But leave him to languish in this muddy field,
and he will become a member
of a lost generation.
Hany's story is a tragedy,
but it doesn't have to end that way.
Thank you.
(Applause)
So ... we're in a real live war
at the moment,
and it's a war that we're truly losing.
It's a war on superbugs.
So you might wonder,
if I'm going to talk about superbugs,
why I'm showing you a photograph
of some soccer fans --
Liverpool soccer fans
celebrating a famous victory
in Istanbul, a decade ago.
In the back, in the red shirt,
well, that's me,
and next to me in the red hat,
that's my friend Paul Rice.
So a couple of years
after this picture was taken,
Paul went into hospital
for some minor surgery,
and he developed
a superbug-related infection,
and he died.
And I was truly shocked.
He was a healthy guy in the prime of life.
So there and then,
and actually with a lot of encouragement
from a couple of TEDsters,
I declared my own
personal war on superbugs.
So let's talk about superbugs
for a moment.
The story actually starts in the 1940s
with the widespread
introduction of antibiotics.
And since then,
drug-resistant bacteria
have continued to emerge,
and so we've been forced to develop
newer and newer drugs
to fight these new bacteria.
And this vicious cycle
actually is the origin of superbugs,
which is simply bacteria
for which we don't have effective drugs.
I'm sure you'll recognize
at least some of these superbugs.
These are the more
common ones around today.
Last year, around 700,000 people died
from superbug-related diseases.
Looking to the future,
if we carry on on the path we're going,
which is basically a drugs-based
approach to the problem,
the best estimate
by the middle of this century
is that the worldwide death toll
from superbugs will be 10 million.
10 million.
Just to put that in context,
that's actually more
than the number of people
that died of cancer worldwide last year.
So it seems pretty clear
that we're not on a good road,
and the drugs-based approach
to this problem is not working.
I'm a physicist,
and so I wondered, could we take
a physics-based approach --
a different approach to this problem.
And in that context,
the first thing we know for sure,
is that we actually know how to kill
every kind of microbe,
every kind of virus,
every kind of bacteria.
And that's with ultraviolet light.
We've actually known this
for more than 100 years.
I think you all know
what ultraviolet light is.
It's part of a spectrum
that includes infrared,
it includes visible light,
and the short-wavelength part
of this group is ultraviolet light.
The key thing from our perspective here
is that ultraviolet light kills bacteria
by a completely different mechanism
from the way drugs kill bacteria.
So ultraviolet light is just as capable
of killing a drug-resistant bacteria
as any other bacteria,
and because ultraviolet light
is so good at killing all bugs,
it's actually used a lot these days
to sterilize rooms,
sterilize working surfaces.
What you see here is a surgical theater
being sterilized with germicidal
ultraviolet light.
But what you don't see
in this picture, actually,
is any people,
and there's a very good reason for that.
Ultraviolet light
is actually a health hazard,
so it can damage cells in our skin,
cause skin cancer,
it can damage cells in our eye,
cause eye diseases like cataract.
So you can't use conventional,
germicidal, ultraviolet light
when there are people are around.
And of course,
we want to sterilize mostly
when there are people around.
So the ideal ultraviolet light
would actually be able
to kill all bacteria,
including superbugs,
but would be safe for human exposure.
And actually that's where my physics
background kicked into this story.
Together with my physics colleagues,
we realized there actually is a particular
wavelength of ultraviolet light
that should kill all bacteria,
but should be safe for human exposure.
That wavelength is called far-UVC light,
and it's just the short-wavelength part
of the ultraviolet spectrum.
So let's see how that would work.
What you're seeing here
is the surface of our skin,
and I'm going to superimpose on that
some bacteria in the air above the skin.
Now we're going to see what happens
when conventional, germicidal,
ultraviolet light impinges on this.
So what you see is,
as we know, germicidal light
is really good at killing bacteria,
but what you also see
is that it penetrates
into the upper layers of our skin,
and it can damage
those key cells in our skin
which ultimately, when damaged,
can lead to skin cancer.
So let's compare now with far-UVC light --
same situation,
skin and some bacteria
in the air above them.
So what you're seeing now
is that again, far-UVC light's
perfectly fine at killing bacteria,
but what far-UVC light can't do
is penetrate into our skin.
And there's a good,
solid physics reason for that:
far-UVC light is incredibly, strongly
absorbed by all biological materials,
so it simply can't go very far.
Now, viruses and bacteria
are really, really, really small,
so the far-UVC light can certainly
penetrate them and kill them,
but what it can't do
is penetrate into skin,
and it can't even penetrate
the dead-cell area
right at the very surface of our skin.
So far-UVC light
should be able to kill bacteria,
but kill them safely.
So that's the theory.
It should work, should be safe.
What about in practice?
Does it really work?
Is it really safe?
So that's actually what our lab
has been working on
the past five or six years,
and I'm delighted to say the answer
to both these questions
is an emphatic yes.
Yes, it does work,
but yes, it is safe.
So I'm delighted to say that,
but actually I'm not very
surprised to say that,
because it's purely the laws
of physics at work.
So let's look to the future.
I'm thrilled that we now have
a completely new weapon,
and I should say an inexpensive weapon,
in our fight against superbugs.
For example,
I see far-UVC lights in surgical theaters.
I see far-UVC lights
in food preparation areas.
And in terms of preventing
the spread of viruses,
I see far-UVC lights in schools,
preventing the spread of influenza,
preventing the spread of measles,
and I see far-UVC lights
in airports or airplanes,
preventing the global spread
of viruses like H1N1 virus.
So back to my friend Paul Rice.
He was actually a well-known
and well-loved local politician
in his and my hometown of Liverpool,
and they put up a statue in his memory
in the center of Liverpool,
and there it is.
But me,
I want Paul's legacy to be a major advance
in this war against superbugs.
Armed with the power of light,
that's actually within our grasp.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Chris Anderson: Stay up here, David,
I've got a question for you.
(Applause)
David, tell us where you're up to
in developing this,
and what are the remaining obstacles
to trying to roll out
and realize this dream?
David Brenner: Well, I think we now know
that it kills all bacteria,
but we sort of knew
that before we started,
but we certainly tested that.
So we have to do lots and lots
of tests about safety,
and so it's more about safety
than it is about efficacy.
And we need to do short-term tests,
and we need to do long-term tests
to make sure you can't develop
melanoma many years on.
So those studies
are pretty well done at this point.
The FDA of course is something
we have to deal with,
and rightly so,
because we certainly can't use this
in the real world without FDA approval.
CA: Are you trying
to launch first in the US,
or somewhere else?
DB: Actually, in a couple of countries.
In Japan and in the US, both.
CA: Have you been able to persuade
biologists, doctors,
that this is a safe approach?
DB: Well, as you can imagine,
there is a certain skepticism
because everybody knows
that UV light is not safe.
So when somebody comes along and says,
"Well, this particular UV light is safe,"
there is a barrier to be crossed,
but the data are there,
and I think that's what
we're going to be standing on.
CA: Well, we wish you well.
This is potentially such important work.
Thank you so much
for sharing this with us.
Thank you, David.
(Applause)
I think I'll start out
and just talk a little bit
about what exactly autism is.
Autism is a very big continuum
that goes from very severe --
the child remains nonverbal --
all the way up to brilliant
scientists and engineers.
And I actually feel at home here,
because there's a lot
of autism genetics here.
(Laughter)
You wouldn't have any --
(Applause)
It's a continuum of traits.
When does a nerd turn into Asperger,
which is just mild autism?
I mean, Einstein and Mozart and Tesla
would all be probably diagnosed
as autistic spectrum today.
And one of the things
that is really going to concern me
is getting these kids to be the ones
that are going to invent
the next energy things
that Bill Gates talked about this morning.
OK, now, if you want
to understand autism: animals.
I want to talk to you now
about different ways of thinking.
You have to get away from verbal language.
I think in pictures.
I don't think in language.
Now, the thing about the autistic mind
is it attends to details.
This is a test where you either
have to pick out the big letters
or the little letters,
and the autistic mind picks out
the little letters more quickly.
And the thing is, the normal brain
ignores the details.
Well, if you're building a bridge,
details are pretty important
because it'll fall down
if you ignore the details.
And one of my big concerns
with a lot of policy things today
is things are getting too abstract.
People are getting away
from doing hands-on stuff.
I'm really concerned
that a lot of the schools
have taken out the hands-on classes,
because art, and classes like that --
those are the classes where I excelled.
In my work with cattle,
I noticed a lot of little things
that most people don't notice
would make the cattle balk.
For example, this flag waving
right in front of the veterinary facility.
This feed yard was going to tear down
their whole veterinary facility;
all they needed to do was move the flag.
Rapid movement, contrast.
In the early '70s when I started,
I got right down in the chutes
to see what cattle were seeing.
People thought that was crazy.
A coat on a fence would make them balk,
shadows would make them balk,
a hose on the floor --
people weren't noticing these things.
A chain hanging down ...
And that's shown
very, very nicely in the movie.
In fact, I loved the movie,
how they duplicated all my projects.
That's the geek side.
My drawings got to star in the movie, too.
And, actually, it's called
"Temple Grandin,"
not "Thinking in Pictures."
So what is thinking in pictures?
It's literally movies in your head.
My mind works like Google for images.
When I was a young kid,
I didn't know my thinking was different.
I thought everybody thought in pictures.
Then when I did my book,
"Thinking in Pictures,"
I started interviewing people
about how they think.
And I was shocked to find out
that my thinking was quite different.
Like if I say, "Think
about a church steeple,"
most people get this sort
of generalized generic one.
Now, maybe that's not true in this room,
but it's going to be true
in a lot of different places.
I see only specific pictures.
They flash up into my memory,
just like Google for pictures.
And in the movie,
they've got a great scene in there,
where the word "shoe" is said,
and a whole bunch of '50s and '60s shoes
pop into my imagination.
OK, there's my childhood church;
that's specific.
There's some more, Fort Collins.
OK, how about famous ones?
And they just kind of come up,
kind of like this.
Just really quickly,
like Google for pictures.
And they come up one at a time,
and then I think, "OK, well,
maybe we can have it snow,
or we can have a thunderstorm,"
and I can hold it there
and turn them into videos.
Now, visual thinking
was a tremendous asset
in my work designing
cattle-handling facilities.
And I've worked really hard
on improving how cattle are treated
at the slaughter plant.
I'm not going to go
into any gucky slaughter slides.
I've got that stuff up on YouTube,
if you want to look at it.
(Laughter)
But one of the things
that I was able to do in my design work
is I could test-run a piece
of equipment in my mind,
just like a virtual reality
computer system.
And this is an aerial view
of a recreation of one of my projects
that was used in the movie.
That was like just so super cool.
And there were a lot of, kind of,
Asperger types and autism types
working out there on the movie set, too.
(Laughter)
But one of the things
that really worries me is:
Where's the younger version
of those kids going today?
They're not ending up in Silicon Valley,
where they belong.
(Laughter)
(Applause)
One of the things I learned very early on
because I wasn't that social,
is I had to sell my work, and not myself.
And the way I sold livestock jobs
is I showed off my drawings,
I showed off pictures of things.
Another thing that helped me
as a little kid
is, boy, in the '50s,
you were taught manners.
You were taught you can't pull
the merchandise off the shelves
in the store and throw it around.
When kids get to be
in third or fourth grade,
you might see that this kid's going
to be a visual thinker,
drawing in perspective.
Now, I want to emphasize
that not every autistic kid
is going to be a visual thinker.
Now, I had this brain scan
done several years ago,
and I used to joke around about having
a gigantic Internet trunk line
going deep into my visual cortex.
This is tensor imaging.
And my great big Internet trunk line
is twice as big as the control's.
The red lines there are me,
and the blue lines are the sex
and age-matched control.
And there I got a gigantic one,
and the control over there, the blue one,
has got a really small one.
And some of the research now is showing
that people on the spectrum actually
think with the primary visual cortex.
Now, the thing is, the visual thinker
is just one kind of mind.
You see, the autistic mind
tends to be a specialist mind --
good at one thing, bad at something else.
And where I was bad was algebra.
And I was never allowed
to take geometry or trig.
Gigantic mistake.
I'm finding a lot of kids
who need to skip algebra,
go right to geometry and trig.
Now, another kind of mind
is the pattern thinker.
More abstract.
These are your engineers,
your computer programmers.
This is pattern thinking.
That praying mantis is made
from a single sheet of paper --
no scotch tape, no cuts.
And there in the background
is the pattern for folding it.
Here are the types of thinking:
photo-realistic visual thinkers, like me;
pattern thinkers, music and math minds.
Some of these oftentimes
have problems with reading.
You also will see these kind of problems
with kids that are dyslexic.
You'll see these different kinds of minds.
And then there's a verbal mind,
they know every fact about everything.
Now, another thing is the sensory issues.
I was really concerned about having
to wear this gadget on my face.
And I came in half an hour beforehand
so I could have it put on
and kind of get used to it,
and they got it bent
so it's not hitting my chin.
But sensory is an issue.
Some kids are bothered
by fluorescent lights;
others have problems
with sound sensitivity.
You know, it's going to be variable.
Now, visual thinking gave me
a whole lot of insight
into the animal mind.
Because think about it:
an animal is a sensory-based thinker,
not verbal -- thinks in pictures,
thinks in sounds, thinks in smells.
Think about how much information
there is on the local fire hydrant.
He knows who's been there --
(Laughter)
When they were there.
Are they friend or foe?
Is there anybody he can go mate with?
There's a ton of information
on that fire hydrant.
It's all very detailed information.
And looking at these kind of details
gave me a lot of insight into animals.
Now, the animal mind, and also my mind,
puts sensory-based information
into categories.
Man on a horse,
and a man on the ground --
that is viewed as two
totally different things.
You could have a horse
that's been abused by a rider.
They'll be absolutely fine
with the veterinarian
and with the horseshoer,
but you can't ride him.
You have another horse,
where maybe the horseshoer beat him up,
and he'll be terrible for anything
on the ground with the veterinarian,
but a person can ride him.
Cattle are the same way.
Man on a horse, a man on foot --
they're two different things.
You see, it's a different picture.
See, I want you to think
about just how specific this is.
Now, this ability to put
information into categories,
I find a lot of people
are not very good at this.
When I'm out troubleshooting equipment
or problems with something in a plant,
they don't seem to be able to figure out:
"Do I have a training-people issue?
Or do I have something wrong
with the equipment?"
In other words, categorize
equipment problem from a people problem.
I find a lot of people
have difficulty doing that.
Now, let's say I figure out
it's an equipment problem.
Is it a minor problem,
with something simple I can fix?
Or is the whole design
of the system wrong?
People have a hard time figuring that out.
Let's just look at something
like, you know,
solving problems with making
airlines safer.
Yeah, I'm a million-mile flier.
I do lots and lots of flying,
and if I was at the FAA,
what would I be doing a lot
of direct observation of?
It would be their airplane tails.
You know, five fatal wrecks
in the last 20 years,
the tail either came off,
or steering stuff inside the tail
broke in some way.
It's tails, pure and simple.
And when the pilots walk
around the plane, guess what?
They can't see that stuff inside the tail.
Now as I think about that,
I'm pulling up all of that
specific information.
It's specific.
See, my thinking's bottom-up.
I take all the little pieces and I put
the pieces together like a puzzle.
Now, here is a horse that was deathly
afraid of black cowboy hats.
He'd been abused by somebody
with a black cowboy hat.
White cowboy hats,
that was absolutely fine.
Now, the thing is,
the world is going to need
all of the different kinds of minds
to work together.
We've got to work on developing
all these different kinds of minds.
And one of the things
that is driving me really crazy
as I travel around
and I do autism meetings,
is I'm seeing a lot of smart,
geeky, nerdy kids,
and they just aren't very social,
and nobody's working
on developing their interest
in something like science.
And this brings up the whole thing
of my science teacher.
My science teacher is shown
absolutely beautifully in the movie.
I was a goofball student
when I was in high school.
I just didn't care at all about studying,
until I had Mr. Carlock's science class.
He was now Dr. Carlock in the movie.
And he got me challenged
to figure out an optical illusion room.
This brings up the whole thing
of you've got to show kids
interesting stuff.
You know, one of the things
that I think maybe TED ought to do
is tell all the schools about all
the great lectures that are on TED,
and there's all kinds
of great stuff on the Internet
to get these kids turned on.
Because I'm seeing a lot
of these geeky, nerdy kids,
and the teachers out in the Midwest
and other parts of the country
when you get away from these tech areas,
they don't know what to do
with these kids.
And they're not going down the right path.
The thing is, you can make a mind
to be more of a thinking
and cognitive mind,
or your mind can be wired
to be more social.
And what some of the research
now has shown in autism
is there may by extra wiring back here
in the really brilliant mind,
and we lose a few social circuits here.
It's kind of a trade-off
between thinking and social.
And then you can get to the point
where it's so severe,
you're going to have a person
that's going to be non-verbal.
In the normal human mind,
language covers up the visual thinking
we share with animals.
This is the work of Dr. Bruce Miller.
He studied Alzheimer's patients
that had frontal temporal lobe dementia.
And the dementia ate out
the language parts of the brain.
And then this artwork came out of somebody
who used to install stereos in cars.
Now, Van Gogh doesn't know
anything about physics,
but I think it's very interesting
that there was some work done
to show that this eddy pattern
in this painting
followed a statistical model
of turbulence,
which brings up the whole interesting idea
of maybe some of this mathematical
patterns is in our own head.
And the Wolfram stuff --
I was taking notes and writing down
all the search words I could use,
because I think that's going to go on
in my autism lectures.
We've got to show
these kids interesting stuff.
And they've taken out the auto-shop class
and the drafting class and the art class.
I mean, art was my best subject in school.
We've got to think about all
these different kinds of minds,
and we've got to absolutely
work with these kind of minds,
because we absolutely are going to need
these kinds of people in the future.
And let's talk about jobs.
OK, my science teacher got me studying,
because I was a goofball
that didn't want to study.
But you know what?
I was getting work experience.
I'm seeing too many of these smart kids
who haven't learned basic things,
like how to be on time -- I was taught
that when I was eight years old.
How to have table manners
at granny's Sunday party.
I was taught that
when I was very, very young.
And when I was 13, I had a job
at a dressmaker's shop sewing clothes.
I did internships in college,
I was building things,
and I also had to learn
how to do assignments.
You know, all I wanted to do was draw
pictures of horses when I was little.
My mother said, "Well let's do
a picture of something else."
They've got to learn
how to do something else.
Let's say the kid is fixated on Legos.
Let's get him working
on building different things.
The thing about the autistic mind
is it tends to be fixated.
Like if the kid loves race cars,
let's use race cars for math.
Let's figure out how long it takes
a race car to go a certain distance.
In other words, use that fixation
in order to motivate that kid,
that's one of the things we need to do.
I really get fed up when the teachers,
especially when you get away
from this part of the country,
they don't know what to do
with these smart kids.
It just drives me crazy.
What can visual thinkers
do when they grow up?
They can do graphic design,
all kinds of stuff with computers,
photography, industrial design.
The pattern thinkers -- they're the ones
that are going to be your mathematicians,
your software engineers,
your computer programmers,
all of those kinds of jobs.
And then you've got the word minds;
they make great journalists,
and they also make really,
really good stage actors.
Because the thing about being autistic is,
I had to learn social skills
like being in a play.
You just kind of ...
you just have to learn it.
And we need to be working
with these students.
And this brings up mentors.
You know, my science teacher
was not an accredited teacher.
He was a NASA space scientist.
Some states now are getting it to where,
if you have a degree in biology
or in chemistry,
you can come into the school
and teach biology or chemistry.
We need to be doing that.
Because what I'm observing is,
the good teachers,
for a lot of these kids,
are out in the community colleges.
But we need to be getting
some of these good teachers
into the high schools.
Another thing that can be very,
very, very successful is:
there's a lot of people
that may have retired
from working in the software industry,
and they can teach your kid.
And it doesn't matter
if what they teach them is old,
because what you're doing
is you're lighting the spark.
You're getting that kid turned on.
And you get him turned on,
then you'll learn all the new stuff.
Mentors are just essential.
I cannot emphasize enough
what my science teacher did for me.
And we've got to mentor them, hire them.
And if you bring them in
for internships in your companies,
the thing about the autism,
Asperger-y kind of mind,
you've got to give them a specific task.
Don't just say, "Design new software."
You've got to tell them
something more specific:
"We're designing software for a phone
and it has to do some specific thing,
and it can only use so much memory."
That's the kind of specificity you need.
Well, that's the end of my talk.
And I just want to thank
everybody for coming.
It was great to be here.
(Applause)
(Applause ends)
Oh -- you have a question for me? OK.
(Applause)
Chris Anderson:
Thank you so much for that.
You know, you once wrote --
I like this quote:
"If by some magic, autism had been
eradicated from the face of the Earth,
then men would still be socializing
in front of a wood fire
at the entrance to a cave."
(Laughter)
Temple Grandin: Because who do you think
made the first stone spear?
It was the Asperger guy,
and if you were to get rid
of all the autism genetics,
there'd be no more Silicon Valley,
and the energy crisis would not be solved.
(Applause)
CA: I want to ask you
a couple other questions,
and if any of these feel inappropriate,
it's OK just to say, "Next question."
But if there is someone here
who has an autistic child,
or knows an autistic child and feels
kind of cut off from them,
what advice would you give them?
TG: Well, first of all,
we've got to look at age.
If you have a two, three or four-year-old,
no speech, no social interaction,
I can't emphasize enough: Don't wait.
You need at least 20 hours a week
of one-to-one teaching.
The thing is, autism comes
in different degrees.
About half of the people on the spectrum
are not going to learn to talk,
and they won't be working
in Silicon Valley.
That would not be a reasonable
thing for them to do.
But then you get these smart,
geeky kids with a touch of autism,
and that's where you've got
to get them turned on
with doing interesting things.
I got social interaction
through shared interests --
I rode horses with other kids,
I made model rockets with other kids,
did electronics lab with other kids.
And in the '60s, it was gluing mirrors
onto a rubber membrane on a speaker
to make a light show.
That was, like,
we considered that super cool.
(Laughter)
CA: Is it unrealistic for them
to hope or think that that child
loves them, as some might, as most, wish?
TG: Well, I tell you,
that child will be loyal,
and if your house is burning down,
they're going to get you out of it.
CA: Wow. So most people, if you ask them
what they're most passionate about,
they'd say things like,
"My kids" or "My lover."
What are you most passionate about?
TG: I'm passionate
about that the things I do
are going to make
the world a better place.
When I have a mother
of an autistic child say,
"My kid went to college
because of your book
or one of your lectures,"
that makes me happy.
You know, the slaughter plants
I worked with in the '80s;
they were absolutely awful.
I developed a really simple
scoring system for slaughter plants,
where you just measure outcomes:
How many cattle fell down?
How many got poked with the prodder?
How many cattle
are mooing their heads off?
And it's very, very simple.
You directly observe a few simple things.
It's worked really well.
I get satisfaction out of seeing stuff
that makes real change in the real world.
We need a lot more of that,
and a lot less abstract stuff.
CA: Totally.
(Applause)
CA: When we were talking on the phone,
one of the things you said
that really astonished me
was that one thing you were passionate
about was server farms.
Tell me about that.
TG: Well, the reason why I got really
excited when I read about that,
it contains knowledge.
It's libraries.
And to me, knowledge is something
that is extremely valuable.
So, maybe over 10 years ago
now, our library got flooded.
This is before the Internet
got really big.
And I was really upset
about all the books being wrecked,
because it was knowledge being destroyed.
And server farms, or data centers,
are great libraries of knowledge.
CA: Temple, can I just say,
it's an absolute delight
to have you at TED.
Thank you so much.
TG: Well, thank you so much. Thank you.
(Applause)
We all go to doctors.
And we do so with trust and blind faith
that the test they are ordering
and the medications they're prescribing
are based upon evidence --
evidence that's designed to help us.
However, the reality is that that hasn't
always been the case for everyone.
What if I told you
that the medical science discovered
over the past century
has been based on only
half the population?
I'm an emergency medicine doctor.
I was trained to be prepared
in a medical emergency.
It's about saving lives. How cool is that?
OK, there's a lot of runny noses
and stubbed toes,
but no matter who walks
through the door to the ER,
we order the same tests,
we prescribe the same medication,
without ever thinking about the sex
or gender of our patients.
Why would we?
We were never taught that there were
any differences between men and women.
A recent Government Accountability study
revealed that 80 percent of the drugs
withdrawn from the market
are due to side effects on women.
So let's think about that for a minute.
Why are we discovering
side effects on women
only after a drug has been
released to the market?
Do you know that it takes years
for a drug to go from an idea
to being tested on cells in a laboratory,
to animal studies,
to then clinical trials on humans,
finally to go through
a regulatory approval process,
to be available for your doctor
to prescribe to you?
Not to mention the millions and billions
of dollars of funding
it takes to go through that process.
So why are we discovering
unacceptable side effects
on half the population
after that has gone through?
What's happening?
Well, it turns out that those cells
used in that laboratory,
they're male cells,
and the animals used
in the animal studies were male animals,
and the clinical trials have been
performed almost exclusively on men.
How is it that the male model became
our framework for medical research?
Let's look at an example that has been
popularized in the media,
and it has to do
with the sleep aid Ambien.
Ambien was released on the market
over 20 years ago,
and since then, hundreds of millions
of prescriptions have been written,
primarily to women, because women
suffer more sleep disorders than men.
But just this past year,
the Food and Drug Administration
recommended cutting the dose in half
for women only,
because they just realized
that women metabolize the drug
at a slower rate than men,
causing them to wake up in the morning
with more of the active drug
in their system.
And then they're drowsy and they're
getting behind the wheel of the car,
and they're at risk
for motor vehicle accidents.
And I can't help but think,
as an emergency physician,
how many of my patients
that I've cared for over the years
were involved in a motor vehicle accident
that possibly could have been prevented
if this type of analysis was performed
and acted upon 20 years ago
when this drug was first released.
How many other things need
to be analyzed by gender?
What else are we missing?
World War II changed a lot of things,
and one of them was this need
to protect people
from becoming victims of medical research
without informed consent.
So some much-needed guidelines
or rules were set into place,
and part of that was this desire
to protect women of childbearing age
from entering into any
medical research studies.
There was fear: what if something
happened to the fetus during the study?
Who would be responsible?
And so the scientists
at this time actually thought
this was a blessing in disguise,
because let's face it -- men's bodies
are pretty homogeneous.
They don't have the constantly
fluctuating levels of hormones
that could disrupt clean data
they could get if they had only men.
It was easier. It was cheaper.
Not to mention, at this time,
there was a general assumption
that men and women
were alike in every way,
apart from their reproductive organs
and sex hormones.
So it was decided:
medical research was performed on men,
and the results were later
applied to women.
What did this do to the notion
of women's health?
Women's health became synonymous
with reproduction:
breasts, ovaries, uterus, pregnancy.
It's this term we now refer
to as "bikini medicine."
And this stayed this way
until about the 1980s,
when this concept was challenged
by the medical community
and by the public health policymakers
when they realized that
by excluding women
from all medical research studies
we actually did them a disservice,
in that apart from reproductive issues,
virtually nothing was known
about the unique needs
of the female patient.
Since that time, an overwhelming amount
of evidence has come to light
that shows us just how different
men and women are in every way.
You know, we have this saying in medicine:
children are not just little adults.
And we say that to remind ourselves
that children actually have
a different physiology than normal adults.
And it's because of this that the medical
specialty of pediatrics came to light.
And we now conduct research on children
in order to improve their lives.
And I know the same thing
can be said about women.
Women are not just men
with boobs and tubes.
But they have their own
anatomy and physiology
that deserves to be studied
with the same intensity.
Let's take the cardiovascular
system, for example.
This area in medicine has done the most
to try to figure out
why it seems men and women have
completely different heart attacks.
Heart disease is the number one killer
for both men and women,
but more women die within the first year
of having a heart attack than men.
Men will complain
of crushing chest pain --
an elephant is sitting on their chest.
And we call this typical.
Women have chest pain, too.
But more women than men
will complain of "just not feeling right,"
"can't seem to get enough air in,"
"just so tired lately."
And for some reason we call this atypical,
even though, as I mentioned,
women do make up half the population.
And so what is some of the evidence
to help explain some of these differences?
If we look at the anatomy,
the blood vessels that surround the heart
are smaller in women compared to men,
and the way that those blood vessels
develop disease is different
in women compared to men.
And the test that we use to determine
if someone is at risk for a heart attack,
well, they were initially designed
and tested and perfected in men,
and so aren't as good
at determining that in women.
And then if we think
about the medications --
common medications
that we use, like aspirin.
We give aspirin to healthy men to help
prevent them from having a heart attack,
but do you know that if you
give aspirin to a healthy woman,
it's actually harmful?
What this is doing is merely telling us
that we are scratching the surface.
Emergency medicine
is a fast-paced business.
In how many life-saving areas of medicine,
like cancer and stroke,
are there important differences between
men and women that we could be utilizing?
Or even, why is it that some people
get those runny noses
more than others,
or why the pain medication that we give
to those stubbed toes
work in some and not in others?
The Institute of Medicine has said
every cell has a sex.
What does this mean?
Sex is DNA.
Gender is how someone
presents themselves in society.
And these two may not always match up,
as we can see with our
transgendered population.
But it's important to realize
that from the moment of conception,
every cell in our bodies --
skin, hair, heart and lungs --
contains our own unique DNA,
and that DNA contains
the chromosomes that determine
whether we become
male or female, man or woman.
It used to be thought
that those sex-determining
chromosomes pictured here --
XY if you're male, XX if you're female --
merely determined whether you
would be born with ovaries or testes,
and it was the sex hormones
that those organs produced
that were responsible for the differences
we see in the opposite sex.
But we now know that
that theory was wrong --
or it's at least a little incomplete.
And thankfully, scientists like Dr. Page
from the Whitehead Institute,
who works on the Y chromosome,
and Doctor Yang from UCLA,
they have found evidence that tells us
that those sex-determining chromosomes
that are in every cell in our bodies
continue to remain active
for our entire lives
and could be what's responsible
for the differences we see
in the dosing of drugs,
or why there are differences
between men and women
in the susceptibility
and severity of diseases.
This new knowledge is the game-changer,
and it's up to those scientists
that continue to find that evidence,
but it's up to the clinicians
to start translating this data
at the bedside, today.
Right now.
And to help do this, I'm a co-founder
of a national organization
called Sex and Gender
Women's Health Collaborative,
and we collect all of this data
so that it's available for teaching
and for patient care.
And we're working to bring together
the medical educators to the table.
That's a big job.
It's changing the way medical training
has been done since its inception.
But I believe in them.
I know they're going to see the value
of incorporating the gender lens
into the current curriculum.
It's about training the future
health care providers correctly.
And regionally,
I'm a co-creator of a division within
the Department of Emergency Medicine
here at Brown University,
called Sex and Gender
in Emergency Medicine,
and we conduct the research to determine
the differences between men and women
in emergent conditions,
like heart disease and stroke
and sepsis and substance abuse,
but we also believe
that education is paramount.
We've created a 360-degree
model of education.
We have programs for the doctors,
for the nurses, for the students
and for the patients.
Because this cannot just be left up
to the health care leaders.
We all have a role in making a difference.
But I must warn you: this is not easy.
In fact, it's hard.
It's essentially changing the way
we think about medicine
and health and research.
It's changing our relationship
to the health care system.
But there's no going back.
We now know just enough
to know that we weren't doing it right.
Martin Luther King, Jr. has said,
"Change does not roll in
on the wheels of inevitability,
but comes through continuous struggle."
And the first step
towards change is awareness.
This is not just about improving
medical care for women.
This is about personalized,
individualized health care for everyone.
This awareness has the power to transform
medical care for men and women.
And from now on, I want you
to ask your doctors
whether the treatments you are receiving
are specific to your sex and gender.
They may not know the answer --
yet.
But the conversation has begun,
and together we can all learn.
Remember, for me
and my colleagues in this field,
your sex and gender matter.
Thank you.
(Applause)
When I was in the fifth grade,
I bought an issue
of "DC Comics Presents #57"
off of a spinner rack
at my local bookstore,
and that comic book changed my life.
The combination of words and pictures
did something inside my head
that had never been done before,
and I immediately fell in love
with the medium of comics.
I became a voracious comic book reader,
but I never brought them to school.
Instinctively, I knew that comic books
didn't belong in the classroom.
My parents definitely were not fans,
and I was certain that my teachers
wouldn't be either.
After all, they never used them to teach,
comic books and graphic novels were never
allowed during silent sustained reading,
and they were never sold
at our annual book fair.
Even so, I kept reading comics,
and I even started making them.
Eventually I became
a published cartoonist,
writing and drawing
comic books for a living.
I also became a high school teacher.
This is where I taught:
Bishop O'Dowd High School
in Oakland, California.
I taught a little bit of math
and a little bit of art,
but mostly computer science,
and I was there for 17 years.
When I was a brand new teacher,
I tried bringing comic books
into my classroom.
I remember telling my students
on the first day of every class
that I was also a cartoonist.
It wasn't so much that I was planning
to teach them with comics,
it was more that I was hoping comics
would make them think that I was cool.
(Laughter)
I was wrong.
This was the '90s,
so comic books didn't have
the cultural cachet that they do today.
My students didn't think I was cool.
They thought I was kind of a dork.
And even worse,
when stuff got hard in my class,
they would use comic books
as a way of distracting me.
They would raise their hands
and ask me questions like,
"Mr. Yang, who do you think
would win in a fight,
Superman or the Hulk?"
(Laughter)
I very quickly realized I had to keep
my teaching and my cartooning separate.
It seemed like my instincts
in fifth grade were correct.
Comic books didn't belong
in the classroom.
But again, I was wrong.
A few years into my teaching career,
I learned firsthand
the educational potential of comics.
One semester, I was asked to sub
for this Algebra 2 class.
I was asked to long-term sub it,
and I said yes, but there was a problem.
At the time, I was also
the school's educational technologist,
which meant every couple of weeks
I had to miss one or two periods
of this Algebra 2 class
because I was in another classroom
helping another teacher
with a computer-related activity.
For these Algebra 2 students,
that was terrible.
I mean, having a long-term
sub is bad enough,
but having a sub for your sub?
That's the worst.
In an effort to provide some sort
of consistency for my students,
I began videotaping
myself giving lectures.
I'd then give these videos to my sub
to play for my students.
I tried to make these videos
as engaging as possible.
I even included
these little special effects.
For instance, after I finished
a problem on the board,
I'd clap my hands,
and the board would magically erase.
(Laughter)
I thought it was pretty awesome.
I was pretty certain
that my students would love it,
but I was wrong.
(Laughter)
These video lectures were a disaster.
I had students coming up to me
and saying things like,
"Mr. Yang, we thought
you were boring in person,
but on video, you are just unbearable."
(Laughter)
So as a desperate second attempt,
I began drawing these lectures as comics.
I'd do these very quickly
with very little planning.
I'd just take a sharpie,
draw one panel after the other,
figuring out what I wanted
to say as I went.
These comics lectures would come out
to anywhere between
four and six pages long,
I'd xerox these, give them to my sub
to hand to my students.
And much to my surprise,
these comics lectures were a hit.
My students would ask me
to make these for them
even when I could be there in person.
It was like they liked cartoon me
more than actual me.
(Laughter)
This surprised me, because my students
are part of a generation
that was raised on screens,
so I thought for sure they would like
learning from a screen
better than learning from a page.
But when I talked to my students
about why they liked
these comics lectures so much,
I began to understand
the educational potential of comics.
First, unlike their math textbooks,
these comics lectures taught visually.
Our students grow up in a visual culture,
so they're used to taking in
information that way.
But unlike other visual narratives,
like film or television
or animation or video,
comics are what I call permanent.
In a comic, past, present and future
all sit side by side on the same page.
This means that the rate
of information flow
is firmly in the hands of the reader.
When my students didn't understand
something in my comics lecture,
they could just reread that passage
as quickly or as slowly as they needed.
It was like I was giving them
a remote control over the information.
The same was not true
of my video lectures,
and it wasn't even true
of my in-person lectures.
When I speak, I deliver the information
as quickly or slowly as I want.
So for certain students
and certain kinds of information,
these two aspects of the comics medium,
its visual nature and its permanence,
make it an incredibly powerful
educational tool.
When I was teaching this Algebra 2 class,
I was also working on my master's
in education at Cal State East Bay.
And I was so intrigued by this experience
that I had with these comics lectures
that I decided to focus
my final master's project on comics.
I wanted to figure out
why American educators
have historically been so reluctant
to use comic books in their classrooms.
Here's what I discovered.
Comic books first became
a mass medium in the 1940s,
with millions of copies
selling every month,
and educators back then took notice.
A lot of innovative teachers began
bringing comics into their classrooms
to experiment.
In 1944, the "Journal
of Educational Sociology"
even devoted an entire issue
to this topic.
Things seemed to be progressing.
Teachers were starting
to figure things out.
But then along comes this guy.
This is child psychologist
Dr. Fredric Wertham,
and in 1954, he wrote a book
called "Seduction of the Innocent,"
where he argues that comic books
cause juvenile delinquency.
(Laughter)
He was wrong.
Now, Dr. Wertham was actually
a pretty decent guy.
He spent most of his career
working with juvenile delinquents,
and in his work he noticed
that most of his clients read comic books.
What Dr. Wertham failed to realize
was in the 1940s and '50s,
almost every kid in America
read comic books.
Dr. Wertham does a pretty
dubious job of proving his case,
but his book does inspire
the Senate of the United States
to hold a series of hearings
to see if in fact comic books
caused juvenile delinquency.
These hearings lasted
for almost two months.
They ended inconclusively,
but not before doing tremendous damage
to the reputation of comic books
in the eyes of the American public.
After this, respectable American
educators all backed away,
and they stayed away for decades.
It wasn't until the 1970s
that a few brave souls
started making their way back in.
And it really wasn't
until pretty recently,
maybe the last decade or so,
that comics have seen
more widespread acceptance
among American educators.
Comic books and graphic novels
are now finally making their way
back into American classrooms
and this is even happening
at Bishop O'Dowd, where I used to teach.
Mr. Smith, one of my former colleagues,
uses Scott McCloud's
"Understanding Comics"
in his literature and film class,
because that book gives his students
the language with which to discuss
the relationship between words and images.
Mr. Burns assigns a comics essay
to his students every year.
By asking his students
to process a prose novel using images,
Mr. Burns asks them to think deeply
not just about the story
but also about how that story is told.
And Ms. Murrock uses
my own "American Born Chinese"
with her English 1 students.
For her, graphic novels
are a great way of fulfilling
a Common Core Standard.
The Standard states that students
ought to be able to analyze
how visual elements contribute
to the meaning, tone and beauty of a text.
Over in the library, Ms. Counts
has built a pretty impressive
graphic novel collection
for Bishop O'Dowd.
Now, Ms. Counts and all
of her librarian colleagues
have really been at the forefront
of comics advocacy,
really since the early '80s,
when a school library journal article
stated that the mere presence
of graphic novels in the library
increased usage by about 80 percent
and increased the circulation
of noncomics material
by about 30 percent.
Inspired by this renewed interest
from American educators,
American cartoonists are now producing
more explicitly educational content
for the K-12 market than ever before.
A lot of this is directed
at language arts,
but more and more comics
and graphic novels
are starting to tackle
math and science topics.
STEM comics graphics novels
really are like this uncharted territory,
ready to be explored.
America is finally waking up to the fact
that comic books
do not cause juvenile delinquency.
(Laughter)
That they really do belong
in every educator's toolkit.
There's no good reason
to keep comic books and graphic novels
out of K-12 education.
They teach visually,
they give our students
that remote control.
The educational potential is there
just waiting to be tapped
by creative people like you.
Thank you.
(Applause)
This is a talk about sugar and cancer.
I became interested in sugar
when I was in college.
Not this kind of sugar.
It was the sugar that our biology
professors taught us about
in the context of the coating
of your cells.
Maybe you didn't know that your cells
are coated with sugar.
And I didn't know that, either,
until I took these courses in college,
but back then --
and this was in, let's just
call it the 1980s --
people didn't know much about why
our cells are coated with sugar.
And when I dug through my notes,
what I noticed I had written down
is that the sugar coating on our cells
is like the sugar coating
on a peanut M and M.
And people thought
the sugar coating on our cells
was like a protective coating
that somehow made our cells
stronger or tougher.
But we now know, many decades later,
that it's much more complicated than that,
and that the sugars on our cells
are actually very complex.
And if you could shrink yourself down
to a little miniature airplane
and fly right along
the surface of your cells,
it might look something like this --
with geographical features.
And now, the complex sugars
are these trees and bushes --
weeping willows that are
swaying in the wind
and moving with the waves.
And when I started thinking about
all these complex sugars
that are like this foliage on our cells,
it became one of the most interesting
problems that I encountered
as a biologist and also as a chemist.
And so now we tend
to think about the sugars
that are populating
the surface of our cells
as a language.
They have a lot of information
stored in their complex structures.
But what are they trying to tell us?
I can tell you that we do know
some information
that comes from these sugars,
and it's turned out already
to be incredibly important
in the world of medicine.
For example, one thing
your sugars are telling us
is your blood type.
So your blood cells, your red blood
cells, are coated with sugars,
and the chemical structures of those
sugars determine your blood type.
So for example, I know
that I am blood type O.
How many people are also blood type O?
Put your hands up.
It's a pretty common one,
so when so few hands go up,
either you're not paying attention
or you don't know your blood type,
and both of those are bad.
(Laughter)
But for those of you who share
the blood type O with me,
what this means is that we have
this chemical structure
on the surface of our blood cells:
three simple sugars linked together
to make a more complex sugar.
And that, by definition, is blood type O.
Now, how many people are blood type A?
Right here.
That means you have
an enzyme in your cells
that adds one more building block,
that red sugar,
to build a more complex structure.
And how many people are blood type B?
Quite a few.
You have a slightly different enzyme
than the A people,
so you build a slightly
different structure,
and those of you that are AB
have the enzyme from your mother,
the other enzyme from your father,
and now you make both of these structures
in roughly equal proportions.
And when this was figured out,
which is now back in the previous century,
this enabled one of the most important
medical procedures in the world,
which, of course,
is the blood transfusion.
And by knowing what your blood type is,
we can make sure,
if you ever need a transfusion,
that your donor has the same blood type,
so that your body
doesn't see foreign sugars,
which it wouldn't like
and would certainly reject.
What else are the sugars on the surface
of your cells trying to tell us?
Well, those sugars might be telling us
that you have cancer.
So a few decades ago,
correlations began to emerge
from the analysis of tumor tissue.
And the typical scenario is a patient
would have a tumor detected,
and the tissue would be removed
in a biopsy procedure
and then sent down to a pathology lab
where that tissue would be analyzed
to look for chemical changes
that might inform the oncologist
about the best course of treatment.
And what was discovered
from studies like that
is that the sugars have changed
when the cell transforms
from being healthy to being sick.
And those correlations have come up
again and again and again.
But a big question in the field
has been: Why?
Why do cancers have different sugars?
What's the importance of that?
Why does it happen, and what
can we do about it if it does turn out
to be related to the disease process?
So, one of the changes that we study
is an increase in the density
of a particular sugar
that's called sialic acid.
And I think this is going to be
one of the most important sugars
of our times,
so I would encourage everybody
to get familiar with this word.
Sialic acid is not
the kind of sugar that we eat.
Those are different sugars.
This is a kind of sugar
that is actually found
at certain levels on all
of the cells in your body.
It's actually quite common on your cells.
But for some reason,
cancer cells, at least in a successful,
progressive disease,
tend to have more sialic acid
than a normal, healthy cell would have.
And why?
What does that mean?
Well, what we've learned
is that it has to do
with your immune system.
So let me tell you a little bit
about the importance of your immune system
in cancer.
And this is something that's, I think,
in the news a lot these days.
You know, people are starting
to become familiar with the term
"cancer immune therapy."
And some of you might even know people
who are benefiting from these very new
ways of treating cancer.
What we now know
is that your immune cells,
which are the white blood cells
coursing through your bloodstream,
protect you on a daily basis
from things gone bad --
including cancer.
And so in this picture,
those little green balls
are your immune cells,
and that big pink cell is a cancer cell.
And these immune cells go around
and taste all the cells in your body.
That's their job.
And most of the time, the cells taste OK.
But once in a while,
a cell might taste bad.
Hopefully, that's the cancer cell,
and when those immune cells
get the bad taste,
they launch an all-out strike
and kill those cells.
So we know that.
We also know that if you can
potentiate that tasting,
if you can encourage those immune cells
to actually take a big old bite
out of a cancer cell,
you get a better job protecting
yourself from cancer every day
and maybe even curing a cancer.
And there are now a couple of drugs
out there in the market
that are used to treat cancer patients
that act exactly by this process.
They activate the immune system
so that the immune system
can be more vigorous
in protecting us from cancer.
In fact, one of those drugs
may well have spared
President Jimmy Carter's life.
Do you remember, President Carter
had malignant melanoma
that had metastasized to his brain,
and that diagnosis is one
that is usually accompanied by numbers
like "months to live."
But he was treated with one
of these new immune-stimulating drugs,
and now his melanoma
appears to be in remission,
which is remarkable,
considering the situation
only a few years ago.
In fact, it's so remarkable
that provocative statements like this one:
"Cancer is having a penicillin moment,"
people are saying,
with these new immune therapy drugs.
I mean, that's an incredibly bold thing
to say about a disease
which we've been fighting for a long time
and mostly losing the battle with.
So this is very exciting.
Now what does this have to do with sugars?
Well, I'll tell you what we've learned.
When an immune cell snuggles
up against a cancer cell to take a taste,
it's looking for signs of disease,
and if it finds those signs,
the cell gets activated and it launches
a missile strike and kills the cell.
But if that cancer cell has a dense forest
of that sugar, sialic acid,
well, it starts to taste pretty good.
And there's a protein on immune cells
that grabs the sialic acid,
and if that protein
gets held at that synapse
between the immune cell
and the cancer cell,
it puts that immune cell to sleep.
The sialic acids are telling
the immune cell,
"Hey, this cell's all right.
Nothing to see here, move along.
Look somewhere else."
So in other words,
as long as our cells are wearing
a thick coat of sialic acid,
they look fabulous, right?
It's amazing.
And what if you could strip off that coat
and take that sugar away?
Well, your immune system
might be able to see that cancer cell
for what it really is:
something that needs to be destroyed.
And so this is what we're doing in my lab.
We're developing new medicines
that are basically
cell-surface lawnmowers --
molecules that go down
to the surface of these cancer cells
and just cut off those sialic acids,
so that the immune system
can reach its full potential
in eliminating those cancer
cells from our body.
So in closing,
let me just remind you again:
your cells are coated with sugars.
The sugars are telling cells
around that cell
whether the cell is good or bad.
And that's important,
because our immune system needs
to leave the good cells alone.
Otherwise, we'd have autoimmune diseases.
But once in a while,
cancers get the ability
to express these new sugars.
And now that we understand
how those sugars mesmerize
the immune system,
we can come up with new medicines
to wake up those immune cells,
tell them, "Ignore
the sugars, eat the cell
and have a delicious snack, on cancer."
Thank you.
(Applause)
Shah Rukh Khan: Be it Mumbai or Delhi,
Chennai or Kolkata,
all our big cities have
one great thing in common,
they happily welcome people from 
smaller places arriving in search of work.
What is also true is that
this warm welcome leads to consequences.
Problems like housing
in these cities are born.
Today we have with us a human settlement
expert and researcher: Dr. Gautam Bhan,
who is re-imagining a solution
to this increasing problem.
He will share with us the new picture
of urban India that he can see.
TED Talks India New Thoughts
welcomes Dr. Gautam Bhan.
Dr. Gautam Bhan, everyone.
(Applause)
Gautam Bhan: In this country,
until a few years ago,
if you asked someone:
"Where are you from?"
the answer would be
Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata.
You'd immediately ask again:
"Where do you belong?"
Until recently in India,
nobody was from a city;
people only migrated to the city.
This is changing.
Urbanization is changing India,
but are our cities prepared?
Let's assume you were born somewhere else.
Your parents worked as laborers all day.
Then you too would have come
to a city for progress.
Or maybe, like it happens today,
you were born in the city itself.
One day you go out looking
for an accommodation in the city,
to buy or maybe just to rent.
Will you be able find an affordable home?
The government says we are falling
short of at least 20 million homes.
20 million homes,
that's 100 million people.
And this is not the shortage of <i>3 BHKs</i>
(bedroom hall kitchen).
95 percent of the shortage
is for people earning
10 to 15,000 rupees per month.
Will you be able to find
an affordable home in this budget?
If this happened with you,
what would you do?
Home is not a car
or some sort of jewellery.
Home is food and clothes.
Nobody can live without it.
If you couldn't find a home
in a city to either buy or rent,
you too would be driven to do
what most people end up doing.
Make a home wherever possible.
You too would make a <i>settlement.</i>
The government may keep calling it a <i>slum,</i>
but like the people living there,
I too will call it a settlement.
One hundred million are not homeless.
They have homes.
Homes they built on their own.
But most of these homes
are in settlements.
This is the truth
of an affordable home in India.
The homes in settlements are cheap,
but not sturdy.
The homes outside are sturdy,
but not cheap.
(Applause)
We will have to lay the foundation
of a new thought from here itself.
A settlement is not a problem;
it is a solution.
We just have to make it secure and sturdy.
To fulfill the shortage
of 20 million homes
you cannot make 20 million
25 square foot flats,
and neither should you be making them.
For example take the Karnataka government.
They have a very good record in this.
By 2020, Karnataka needs
2.6 million homes.
In the last ten years they have managed
to make 350,000 homes.
Even if a government tries
with complete sincerity,
it cannot fulfill this need
in the next couple of lifetimes.
If we do not make new homes,
then what is the next solution?
How to make a settlement secure?
Firstly, eviction needs to be stopped.
Bulldozing needs to be stopped.
Never has that resulted
in progress in the past,
nor will it in the future.
(Applause)
We have to start believing that
the laborers who build and run the city
have a right over the land of that city.
(Applause)
I know you are thinking
that settlements are made
on illegally captured land,
but capturing of land never happens
in the dead of the night.
Whether the land belongs
to the government or not,
a settlement is never formed secretly.
It is inhabited over time.
The government also agrees that
the settlements in our cities have been
there for over 10, 20, 30, even 40 years.
What kind of
illegally captured land is this,
which was ignored for 30 years
and suddenly a day before eviction
is declared illegal?
A settlement can easily accommodate
15 to 60 percent of a city's population
by using just one, two
or maximum ten percent of the land.
Can such a huge number of people not have
a right over this small bit of land?
A city's progress is often measured
by the cost of its land.
How do you ascribe a cost to the life
of a person living on a piece of land?
A settlement is not asking you
for shiny homes;
all it's asking for is basic necessities:
electricity, roads, water,
toilets and drainage.
We call this <i>upgradation.</i>
Here's an example of upgradation.
In Ahmedabad, they started a program
where for ten years, 44 settlements were
promised there wouldn't be any eviction.
Only a promise.
Nothing written, no documents.
And basic necessities
were provided to them.
In ten years that slum changed into
a locality, a place, a world of its own.
The government didn't have to build
even a single new home.
(Applause)
Thailand launched this program
at national scale,
benefiting 100,000 people in 137 cities.
And every person was given the right
to live over that land.
But pay attention here.
Not the right to sell,
but the right to live there,
use it, settle on it.
The whole world knows now
that to move forward,
we cannot remove settlements.
We can only advance when we think of ways
to make settlements secure and sturdy.
But just one thing.
If we know it, then why doesn't it happen?
To apply this new thinking to settlements,
we, that is you and me,
need to look deep within
and get rid of the disgust, disrespect
and apprehensions that we have.
Actually I should not be standing
here in front of you today.
A person from the settlement who lives
there should be standing here.
But if someone like that came here,
you wouldn't have listened to him.
You are listening to me, because you think
I am not from a settlement.
This is the very thought
that needs to be changed.
Thank you.
(Applause)
SRK: Thank you very much.
Thank you, Dr. Gautam Bhan.
Thanks a lot.
Please tell me, you just gave
an example of Thailand
and the big thing there is
the homes are for people
to settle in, not to sell.
They cannot be used for sale.
Is there a similar thought process
or program in our country too,
inspired by your talks
and those of people around you?
GB: I wouldn't say by me,
but by the people movement
who are fighting for rights in the city.
That is making a difference.
For instance, in Odisha
the Chief Minister, Mr. Patnaik,
announced the same scheme:
that all the people in settlements
will have rights over that land.
(Applause)
And I think this scheme
shouldn't be called populism;
it should be called an economic
development strategy.
Because economic development does not
happen from the top, but from the bottom.
(Applause)
SRK: I too promise
I will only say settlements,
and not slums, ever again. 100 percent.
(Applause)
Dr. Bhan you came here and said such
wonderful things.
There is a song. I will not sing it,
as I am a terrible singer.
GB: I too am a terrible singer.
SRK: But we can't keep shut also,
because we are saying wonderful things.
(laughter)
So we will just say it.
Slowly the heart will find settlement.
GB: Slowly the heart will find settlement.
SRK: Only then will life be filled
with love and fun times.
(Applause)
Ladies and gentlemen, Dr. Gautam Bhan.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
Khan Academy is most known
for its collection of videos,
so before I go any further,
let me show you a little bit of a montage.
(Video) Salman Khan: So the hypotenuse
is now going to be five.
This animal's fossils are only found
in this area of South America --
a nice clean band here --
and this part of Africa.
We can integrate over the surface,
and the notation
usually is a capital sigma.
National Assembly: They create
the Committee of Public Safety,
which sounds like a very nice committee.
Notice, this is an aldehyde,
and it's an alcohol.
Start differentiating
into effector and memory cells.
A galaxy. Hey! There's another galaxy.
Oh, look! There's another galaxy.
And for dollars, is their 30 million,
plus the 20 million dollars
from the American manufacturer.
If this does not blow your mind,
then you have no emotion.
(Laughter)
(Applause)
(Live) SK: We now have
on the order of 2,200 videos,
covering everything from basic arithmetic,
all the way to vector calculus,
and some of the stuff
that you saw up there.
We have a million students
a month using the site,
watching on the order
of 100 to 200,000 videos a day.
But what we're going to talk about in this
is how we're going to the next level.
But before I do that,
I want to talk a little bit
about really just how I got started.
And some of you all might know,
about five years ago,
I was an analyst at a hedge fund,
and I was in Boston,
and I was tutoring my cousins
in New Orleans, remotely.
And I started putting
the first YouTube videos up,
really just as a kind of nice-to-have,
just kind of a supplement for my cousins,
something that might give them
a refresher or something.
And as soon as I put those
first YouTube videos up,
something interesting happened.
Actually, a bunch of interesting
things happened.
The first was the feedback
from my cousins.
They told me that they preferred
me on YouTube than in person.
(Laughter)
And once you get over
the backhanded nature of that,
there was actually something
very profound there.
They were saying that they preferred
the automated version of their cousin
to their cousin.
At first it's very unintuitive,
but when you think about it from their
point of view, it makes a ton of sense.
You have this situation where now
they can pause and repeat their cousin,
without feeling
like they're wasting my time.
If they have to review something
that they should have learned
a couple of weeks ago,
or maybe a couple of years ago,
they don't have to be embarrassed
and ask their cousin.
They can just watch those videos;
if they're bored, they can go ahead.
They can watch at their own time and pace.
Probably the least-appreciated aspect
of this
is the notion that the very first time
that you're trying to get
your brain around a new concept,
the very last thing you need
is another human being saying,
"Do you understand this?"
And that's what was happening
with the interaction
with my cousins before,
and now they can just do it
in the intimacy of their own room.
The other thing that happened is --
I put them on YouTube just --
I saw no reason to make it private,
so I let other people watch it,
and then people started stumbling on it,
and I started getting
some comments and some letters
and all sorts of feedback
from random people around the world.
These are just a few.
This is actually from one
of the original calculus videos.
Someone wrote it on YouTube,
it was a YouTube comment:
"First time I smiled doing a derivative."
(Laughter)
Let's pause here.
This person did a derivative,
and then they smiled.
(Laughter)
In response to that same comment --
this is on the thread, you can go
on YouTube and look at the comments --
someone else wrote: "Same thing here.
I actually got a natural high
and a good mood for the entire day,
since I remember seeing
all of this matrix text in class,
and here I'm all like, 'I know kung fu.'"
(Laughter)
We get a lot of feedback
along those lines.
This clearly was helping people.
But then, as the viewership
kept growing and kept growing,
I started getting letters from people,
and it was starting to become clear
that it was more than just a nice-to-have.
This is just an excerpt
from one of those letters:
"My 12 year-old son has autism,
and has had a terrible time with math.
We have tried everything,
viewed everything, bought everything.
We stumbled on your video
on decimals, and it got through.
Then we went on to the dreaded fractions.
Again, he got it.
We could not believe it.
He is so excited."
And so you can imagine,
here I was, an analyst at a hedge fund --
it was very strange for me to do
something of social value.
(Laughter)
(Applause)
But I was excited, so I kept going.
And then a few other things
started to dawn on me;
that not only would it
help my cousins right now,
or these people who were sending letters,
but that this content will never grow old,
that it could help their kids
or their grandkids.
If Isaac Newton had done
YouTube videos on calculus,
I wouldn't have to.
(Laughter)
Assuming he was good. We don't know.
(Laughter)
The other thing that happened --
and even at this point, I said,
"OK, maybe it's a good supplement.
It's good for motivated students.
It's good for maybe home-schoolers."
But I didn't think it would somehow
penetrate the classroom.
Then I started getting
letters from teachers,
and the teachers would write, saying,
"We've used your videos
to flip the classroom.
You've given the lectures,
so now what we do --"
And this could happen in every classroom
in America tomorrow --
"what I do is I assign
the lectures for homework,
and what used to be homework,
I now have the students
doing in the classroom."
And I want to pause here --
(Applause)
I want to pause here, because there's
a couple of interesting things.
One, when those teachers are doing that,
there's the obvious benefit --
the benefit that now their students
can enjoy the videos in the way
that my cousins did,
they can pause, repeat at their
own pace, at their own time.
But the more interesting thing --
and this is the unintuitive thing
when you talk about technology
in the classroom --
by removing the one-size-fits-all
lecture from the classroom,
and letting students have
a self-paced lecture at home,
then when you go to the classroom,
letting them do work,
having the teacher walk around,
having the peers actually be able
to interact with each other,
these teachers have used technology
to humanize the classroom.
They took a fundamentally
dehumanizing experience --
30 kids with their fingers on their lips,
not allowed to interact with each other.
A teacher, no matter how good,
has to give this one-size-fits-all
lecture to 30 students --
blank faces, slightly antagonistic --
and now it's a human experience,
now they're actually
interacting with each other.
So once the Khan Academy --
I quit my job,
and we turned into a real organization --
we're a not-for-profit --
the question is, how do we take this
to the next level?
How do we take what those teachers
were doing to its natural conclusion?
And so, what I'm showing over here,
these are actual exercises
that I started writing for my cousins.
The ones I started
were much more primitive.
This is a more competent version of it.
But the paradigm here is, we'll generate
as many questions as you need,
until you get that concept,
until you get 10 in a row.
And the Khan Academy videos are there.
You get hints, the actual
steps for that problem,
if you don't know how to do it.
The paradigm here seems
like a very simple thing:
10 in a row, you move on.
But it's fundamentally different
than what's happening
in classrooms right now.
In a traditional classroom,
you have homework, lecture,
homework, lecture,
and then you have a snapshot exam.
And that exam, whether you get
a 70 percent, an 80 percent,
a 90 percent or a 95 percent,
the class moves on to the next topic.
And even that 95 percent student --
what was the five percent
they didn't know?
Maybe they didn't know what happens when
you raise something to the zeroth power.
Then you build on that
in the next concept.
That's analogous to --
imagine learning to ride a bicycle.
Maybe I give you a lecture ahead of time,
and I give you a bicycle for two weeks,
then I come back after two weeks,
and say, "Well, let's see.
You're having trouble taking left turns.
You can't quite stop.
You're an 80 percent bicyclist."
So I put a big "C" stamp
on your forehead --
(Laughter)
and then I say, "Here's a unicycle."
(Laughter)
But as ridiculous as that sounds,
that's exactly what's happening
in our classrooms right now.
And the idea is you fast forward
and good students start failing
algebra all of the sudden,
and start failing
calculus all of the sudden,
despite being smart,
despite having good teachers,
and it's usually because they have
these Swiss cheese gaps
that kept building
throughout their foundation.
So our model is: learn math
the way you'd learn anything,
like riding a bicycle.
Stay on that bicycle.
Fall off that bicycle.
Do it as long as necessary,
until you have mastery.
The traditional model,
it penalizes you
for experimentation and failure,
but it does not expect mastery.
We encourage you to experiment.
We encourage you to fail.
But we do expect mastery.
This is just another one of the modules.
This is trigonometry.
This is shifting and reflecting functions.
And they all fit together.
We have about 90 of these right now.
You can go to the site right now,
it's all free,
not trying to sell anything.
But the general idea is that they all
fit into this knowledge map.
That top node right there,
that's literally single-digit addition,
it's like one plus one is equal to two.
The paradigm is, once you get
10 in a row on that,
it keeps forwarding you
to more and more advanced modules.
Further down the knowledge map,
we're getting into more
advanced arithmetic.
Further down, you start getting
into pre-algebra and early algebra.
Further down, you start getting
into algebra one, algebra two,
a little bit of precalculus.
And the idea is, from this we can
actually teach everything --
well, everything that can be taught
in this type of a framework.
So you can imagine -- and this
is what we are working on --
from this knowledge map, you have
logic, you have computer programming,
you have grammar, you have genetics,
all based off of that core of,
if you know this and that,
now you're ready for this next concept.
Now that can work well
for an individual learner,
and I encourage you
to do it with your kids,
but I also encourage everyone
in the audience to do it yourself.
It'll change what happens
at the dinner table.
But what we want to do
is use the natural conclusion
of the flipping of the classroom
that those early teachers
had emailed me about.
And so what I'm showing you here,
this is data from a pilot
in the Los Altos school district,
where they took two fifth-grade classes
and two seventh-grade classes,
and completely gutted
their old math curriculum.
These kids aren't using textbooks,
or getting one-size-fits-all lectures.
They're doing Khan Academy, that software,
for roughly half of their math class.
I want to be clear: we don't view this
as a complete math education.
What it does is -- this is
what's happening in Los Altos --
it frees up time --
it's the blocking and tackling,
making sure you know how to move
through a system of equations,
and it frees up time
for the simulations, for the games,
for the mechanics, for the robot-building,
for the estimating how high
that hill is based on its shadow.
And so the paradigm is
the teacher walks in every day,
every kid works at their own pace --
this is actually a live dashboard
from the Los Altos school district --
and they look at this dashboard.
Every row is a student.
Every column is one of those concepts.
Green means the student's
already proficient.
Blue means they're working
on it -- no need to worry.
Red means they're stuck.
And what the teacher does
is literally just say,
"Let me intervene on the red kids."
Or even better, "Let me get
one of the green kids,
who are already proficient
in that concept,
to be the first line of attack,
and actually tutor their peer."
(Applause)
Now, I come from a very
data-centric reality,
so we don't want that teacher
to even go and intervene
and have to ask the kid awkward questions:
"What don't you understand? What do
you understand?" and all the rest.
So our paradigm is to arm teachers
with as much data as possible --
data that, in any other
field, is expected,
in finance, marketing, manufacturing --
so the teachers can diagnose
what's wrong with the students
so they can make their interaction
as productive as possible.
Now teachers know exactly
what the students have been up to,
how long they've spent each day,
what videos they've watched,
when did they pause the videos,
what did they stop watching,
what exercises are they using,
what have they focused on?
The outer circle shows
what exercises they were focused on.
The inner circle shows
the videos they're focused on.
The data gets pretty granular,
so you can see the exact problems
the student got right or wrong.
Red is wrong, blue is right.
The leftmost question is the first one
the student attempted.
They watched the video over there.
And you can see, eventually
they were able to get 10 in a row.
It's almost like you can see them
learning over those last 10 problems.
They also got faster -- the height
is how long it took them.
When you talk about self-paced learning,
it makes sense for everyone --
in education-speak,
"differentiated learning" --
but it's kind of crazy, what happens
when you see it in a classroom.
Because every time we've done this,
in every classroom we've done,
over and over again,
if you go five days into it,
there's a group of kids who've raced ahead
and a group who are a little bit slower.
In a traditional model,
in a snapshot assessment,
you say, "These are the gifted kids,
these are the slow kids.
Maybe they should be tracked differently.
Maybe we should put them
in different classes."
But when you let students
work at their own pace --
we see it over and over again --
you see students who took
a little bit extra time
on one concept or the other,
but once they get through that concept,
they just race ahead.
And so the same kids that you
thought were slow six weeks ago,
you now would think are gifted.
And we're seeing it over and over again.
It makes you really wonder
how much all of the labels maybe
a lot of us have benefited from
were really just due
to a coincidence of time.
Now as valuable as something like this is
in a district like Los Altos,
our goal is to use technology
to humanize, not just in Los Altos,
but on a global scale,
what's happening in education.
And that brings up an interesting point.
A lot of the effort
in humanizing the classroom
is focused on student-to-teacher ratios.
In our mind, the relevant metric is:
student-to-valuable-human-time-
with-the-teacher ratio.
So in a traditional model,
most of the teacher's time
is spent doing lectures
and grading and whatnot.
Maybe five percent of their time
is sitting next to students
and working with them.
Now, 100 percent of their time is.
So once again, using technology,
not just flipping the classroom,
you're humanizing
the classroom, I'd argue,
by a factor of five or 10.
As valuable as that is in Los Altos,
imagine what it does to the adult learner,
who's embarrassed to go back
and learn stuff
they should have known
before going back to college.
Imagine what it does
to a street kid in Calcutta,
who has to help his family during the day,
and that's the reason
he or she can't go to school.
Now they can spend two hours
a day and remediate,
or get up to speed
and not feel embarrassed
about what they do or don't know.
Now imagine what happens where --
we talked about the peers
teaching each other
inside of a classroom.
But this is all one system.
There's no reason why you can't
have that peer-to-peer tutoring
beyond that one classroom.
Imagine what happens
if that student in Calcutta
all of the sudden can tutor your son,
or your son can tutor
that kid in Calcutta.
And I think what you'll see emerging
is this notion of a global
one-world classroom.
And that's essentially
what we're trying to build.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Bill Gates: I'll ask about two
or three questions.
Salman Khan: Oh, OK.
(Applause continues)
(Applause ends)
BG: I've seen some things
you're doing in the system,
that have to do with motivation
and feedback --
energy points, merit badges.
Tell me what you're thinking there.
SK: Oh yeah. No, we have
an awesome team working on it.
I have to be clear,
it's not just me anymore.
I'm still doing all the videos,
but we have a rock-star team
doing the software.
We've put a bunch of game mechanics
in there, where you get badges,
we're going to start having leader boards
by area, you get points.
It's actually been pretty interesting.
Just the wording of the badging,
or how many points you get
for doing something,
we see on a system-wide basis,
like tens of thousands
of fifth-graders or sixth-graders
going one direction or another,
depending what badge you give them.
(Laughter)
BG: And the collaboration
you're doing with Los Altos,
how did that come about?
SK: Los Altos, it was kind of crazy.
Once again, I didn't expect it
to be used in classrooms.
Someone from their board came and said,
"What would you do if you had
carte Blanche in a classroom?"
I said, "Well, every student
would work at their own pace,
on something like this,
we'd give a dashboard."
They said, "This is kind of radical.
We have to think about it."
Me and the rest of the team were like,
"They're never going to want to do this."
But literally the next day they were like,
"Can you start in two weeks?"
(Laughter)
BG: So fifth-grade math
is where that's going on right now?
SK: It's two fifth-grade classes
and two seventh-grade classes.
They're doing it at the district level.
I think what they're excited about
is they can follow these kids,
not only in school; on Christmas,
we saw some of the kids were doing it.
We can track everything, track them
as they go through the entire district.
Through the summers, as they go
from one teacher to the next,
you have this continuity of data that
even at the district level, they can see.
BG: So some of those views we saw
were for the teacher
to go in and track actually
what's going on with those kids.
So you're getting feedback
on those teacher views
to see what they think they need?
SK: Oh yeah. Most of those
were specs by the teachers.
We made some of those for students
so they could see their data,
but we have a very tight design loop
with the teachers themselves.
And they're saying,
"Hey, this is nice, but --"
Like that focus graph,
a lot of the teachers said,
"I have a feeling a lot of the kids
are jumping around
and not focusing on one topic."
So we made that focus diagram.
So it's all been teacher-driven.
It's been pretty crazy.
BG: Is this ready for prime time?
Do you think a lot of classes next school
year should try this thing out?
SK: Yeah, it's ready.
We've got a million people
on the site already,
so we can handle a few more.
(Laughter)
No, no reason why it really can't happen
in every classroom in America tomorrow.
BG: And the vision of the tutoring thing.
The idea there is,
if I'm confused about a topic,
somehow right in the user interface,
I'd find people who are volunteering,
maybe see their reputation,
and I could schedule and connect up
with those people?
SK: Absolutely. And this is something
I recommend everyone in this audience do.
Those dashboards the teachers have,
you can go log in right now
and you can essentially become a coach
for your kids, your nephews, your cousins,
or maybe some kids
at the Boys and Girls Club.
And yeah, you can start
becoming a mentor, a tutor,
really immediately.
But yeah, it's all there.
BG: Well, it's amazing.
I think you just got a glimpse
of the future of education.
BG: Thank you.
SK: Thank you.
(Applause)
Thanks very much.
I am Hannah Fry, the badass.
And today I'm asking the question:
Is life really that complex?
Now, I've only got nine minutes
to try and provide you with an answer,
so what I've done
is split this neatly into two parts:
part one: yes;
and later on, part two: no.
Or, to be more accurate: no?
(Laughter)
So first of all, let me try and define
what I mean by "complex."
Now, I could give you
a host of formal definitions,
but in the simplest terms,
any problem in complexity is something
that Einstein and his peers can't do.
So, let's imagine --
if the clicker works ... there we go.
Einstein is playing a game of snooker.
He's a clever chap, so he knows
that when he hits the cue ball,
he could write you an equation
and tell you exactly where the red ball
is going to hit the sides,
how fast it's going
and where it's going to end up.
Now, if you scale these snooker balls
up to the size of the solar system,
Einstein can still help you.
Sure, the physics changes,
but if you wanted to know about
the path of the Earth around the Sun,
Einstein could write you an equation
telling you where both objects are
at any point in time.
Now, with a surprising
increase in difficulty,
Einstein could include
the Moon in his calculations.
But as you add more and more planets,
Mars and Jupiter, say,
the problem gets too tough for Einstein
to solve with a pen and paper.
Now, strangely, if instead of having
a handful of planets,
you had millions of objects
or even billions,
the problem actually becomes much simpler,
and Einstein is back in the game.
Let me explain what I mean by this,
by scaling these objects back down
to a molecular level.
If you wanted to trace the erratic path
of an individual air molecule,
you'd have absolutely no hope.
But when you have millions
of air molecules all together,
they start to act in a way
which is quantifiable, predictable
and well-behaved.
And thank goodness air is well-behaved,
because if it wasn't,
planes would fall out of the sky.
Now, on an even bigger scale,
across the whole of the world,
the idea is exactly the same
with all of these air molecules.
It's true that you can't take
an individual rain droplet
and say where it's come from
or where it's going to end up.
But you can say with pretty good certainty
whether it will be cloudy tomorrow.
So that's it.
In Einstein's time,
this is how far science had got.
We could do really small problems
with a few objects
with simple interactions,
or we could do huge problems
with millions of objects
and simple interactions.
But what about everything in the middle?
Well, just seven years
before Einstein's death,
an American scientist called
Warren Weaver made exactly this point.
He said that scientific methodology
has gone from one extreme to another,
leaving out an untouched
great middle region.
Now, this middle region
is where complexity science lies,
and this is what I mean by complex.
Now, unfortunately, almost
every single problem you can think of
to do with human behavior
lies in this middle region.
Einstein's got absolutely no idea
how to model the movement of a crowd.
There are too many people
to look at them all individually
and too few to treat them as a gas.
Similarly, people are prone
to annoying things like decisions
and not wanting to walk into each other,
which makes the problem
all the more complicated.
Einstein also couldn't tell you
when the next stock market crash
is going to be.
Einstein couldn't tell you
how to improve unemployment.
Einstein can't even tell you
whether the next iPhone
is going to be a hit or a flop.
So to conclude part one:
we're completely screwed.
We've got no tools to deal with this,
and life is way too complex.
But maybe there's hope,
because in the last few years,
we've begun to see the beginnings
of a new area of science
using mathematics
to model our social systems.
And I'm not just talking here
about statistics and computer simulations.
I'm talking about writing down
equations about our society
that will help us understand
what's going on
in the same way as with the snooker balls
or the weather prediction.
And this has come about
because people have begun to realize
that we can use and exploit analogies
between our human systems
and those of the physical world around us.
Now, to give you an example:
the incredibly complex problem
of migration across Europe.
Actually, as it turns out, when you view
all of the people together,
collectively, they behave as though
they're following the laws of gravity.
But instead of planets
being attracted to one another,
it's people who are attracted
to areas with better job opportunities,
higher pay, better quality of life
and lower unemployment.
And in the same way as people
are more likely to go for opportunities
close to where they live already --
London to Kent, for example,
as opposed to London to Melbourne --
the gravitational effect of planets
far away is felt much less.
So, to give you another example:
in 2008, a group in UCLA
were looking into the patterns
of burglary hot spots in the city.
Now, one thing about burglaries
is this idea of repeat victimization.
So if you have a group of burglars
who manage to successfully rob an area,
they'll tend to return to that area
and carry on burgling it.
So they learn the layout of the houses,
the escape routes
and the local security measures
that are in place.
And this will continue to happen
until local residents and police
ramp up the security,
at which point, the burglars
will move off elsewhere.
And it's that balance
between burglars and security
which creates these dynamic
hot spots of the city.
As it turns out,
this is exactly the same process
as how a leopard gets its spots,
except in the leopard example,
it's not burglars and security,
it's the chemical process
that creates these patterns
and something called "morphogenesis."
We actually know an awful lot
about the morphogenesis of leopard spots.
Maybe we can use this to try and spot
some of the warning signs with burglaries
and perhaps, also to create
better crime strategies to prevent crime.
There's a group here at UCL
who are working with
the West Midlands police right now
on this very question.
I could give you
plenty of examples like this,
but I wanted to leave you
with one from my own research
on the London riots.
Now, you probably
don't need me to tell you
about the events of last summer,
where London and the UK saw
the worst sustained period
of violent looting and arson
for over twenty years.
It's understandable that, as a society,
we want to try and understand
exactly what caused these riots,
but also, perhaps, to equip our police
with better strategies
to lead to a swifter
resolution in the future.
Now, I don't want to upset
the sociologists here,
so I absolutely cannot talk about
the individual motivations for a rioter,
but when you look at
the rioters all together,
mathematically, you can separate it
into a three-stage process
and draw analogies accordingly.
So, step one: let's say
you've got a group of friends.
None of them are involved in the riots,
but one of them walks past
a Foot Locker which is being raided,
and goes in and bags himself
a new pair of trainers.
He texts one of his friends and says,
"Come on down to the riots."
So his friend joins him,
and then the two of them text
more of their friends, who join them,
and text more of their friends
and more and more, and so it continues.
This process is identical to the way
that a virus spreads through a population.
If you think about the bird flu epidemic
of a couple of years ago,
the more people that were infected,
the more people that got infected,
and the faster the virus spread
before the authorities managed
to get a handle on events.
And it's exactly the same process here.
So let's say you've got a rioter,
he's decided he's going to riot.
The next thing he has to do
is pick a riot site.
Now, what you should know
about rioters is that, um ...
Oops, clicker's gone. There we go.
What you should know about rioters is,
they're not prepared to travel
that far from where they live,
unless it's a really juicy riot site.
(Laughter)
So you can see that here from this graph,
with an awful lot of rioters
having traveled less than a kilometer
to the site that they went to.
Now, this pattern is seen
in consumer models of retail spending,
i.e., where we choose to go shopping.
So, of course, people like
to go to local shops,
but you'd be prepared
to go a little bit further
if it was a really good retail site.
And this analogy, actually, was already
picked up by some of the papers,
with some tabloid press calling the events
"Shopping with violence,"
which probably sums it up
in terms of our research.
Oh! -- we're going backwards.
OK, step three.
Finally, the rioter is at his site,
and he wants to avoid
getting caught by the police.
The rioters will avoid
the police at all times,
but there is some safety in numbers.
And on the flip side, the police,
with their limited resources,
are trying to protect
as much of the city as possible,
arrest rioters wherever possible
and to create a deterrent effect.
And actually, as it turns out,
this mechanism between the two species,
so to speak, of rioters and police,
is identical to predators
and prey in the wild.
So if you can imagine rabbits and foxes,
rabbits are trying to avoid
foxes at all costs,
while foxes are patrolling the space,
trying to look for rabbits.
We actually know an awful lot
about the dynamics of predators and prey.
We also know a lot about
consumer spending flows.
And we know a lot about
how viruses spread through a population.
So if you take these three analogies
together and exploit them,
you can come up with a mathematical
model of what actually happened,
that's capable of replicating
the general patterns
of the riots themselves.
Now, once we've got this,
we can almost use this as a petri dish
and start having conversations
about which areas of the city
were more susceptible than others
and what police tactics could be used
if this were ever to happen
again in the future.
Even twenty years ago, modeling
of this sort was completely unheard of.
But I think that these analogies
are an incredibly important tool
in tackling problems with our society,
and perhaps, ultimately improving
our society overall.
So, to conclude: life is complex,
but perhaps understanding it need not
necessarily be that complicated.
Thank you.
(Applause)
This is a work in process,
based on some comments
that were made at TED two years ago
about the need for the storage of vaccine.
(Video): [On this planet
1.6 billion people
don't have access to electricity
refrigeration
or stored fuels
this is a problem
it impacts:
the spread of disease
the storage of food and medicine
and the quality of life.
So here's the plan ...
inexpensive refrigeration
that doesn't use electricity,
propane, gas, kerosene or consumables
time for some thermodynamics
And the story of the Intermittent
Absorption Refrigerator]
Adam Grosser: So 29 years ago,
I had this thermo teacher
who talked about absorption
and refrigeration, one of those things
that stuck in my head, a lot
like the Stirling engine:
it was cool, but you didn't know
what to do with it.
It was invented in 1858,
by this guy Ferdinand Carré,
but he couldn't actually build
anything with it
because of the tools at the time.
This crazy Canadian named Powel Crosley
commercialized this thing
called the IcyBall, in 1928.
It was a really neat idea,
and I'll get to why it didn't work,
but here's how it works.
There's two spheres
and they're separated in distance.
One has a working fluid,
water and ammonia,
and the other is a condenser.
You heat up one side, the hot side.
The ammonia evaporates
and it recondenses in the other side.
You let it cool to room temperature,
and then, as the ammonia reevaporates
and combines with the water
back on the erstwhile hot side,
it creates a powerful cooling effect.
So it was a great idea
that didn't work at all.
They blew up.
(Laughter)
Because you're using ammonia,
you get hugely high pressures
if you heated them wrong;
it topped 400 psi.
The ammonia was toxic,
it sprayed everywhere.
But it was kind of an interesting thought.
So the great thing about 2006,
there's a lot of really great
computational work you can do.
So we got the whole thermodynamics
department at Stanford involved --
a lot of computational fluid dynamics.
We proved that most of the ammonia
refrigeration tables are wrong.
We found some nontoxic refrigerants
that worked at very low vapor pressures.
We brought in a team from the UK --
a lot of great refrigeration people,
it turns out, in the UK --
and built a test rig,
and proved that, in fact,
we could make a low-pressure,
nontoxic refrigerator.
So this is the way it works.
You put it on a cooking fire.
Most people have
cooking fires in the world,
whether it's camel dung or wood.
It heats up for about 30 minutes,
cools for an hour.
You put it into a container
and it will refrigerate for 24 hours.
It looks like this.
This is the fifth prototype,
it's not quite done.
It weighs about eight pounds,
and this is the way it works.
You put it into a 15-liter vessel,
about three gallons,
and it'll cool it down
to just above freezing --
three degrees above freezing --
for 24 hours in a 30 degree C environment.
It's really cheap.
We think we can build these
in high volumes for about 25 dollars,
in low volumes for about 40 dollars.
And we think we can make refrigeration
something that everybody can have.
Thank you.
(Applause)
I’m working a lot with motion and animation,
and also I'm an old DJ and a musician.
So, music videos are something that I always found interesting,
but they always seem to be so reactive.
So I was thinking, can you remove us as creators
and try to make the music be the voice
and have the animation following it?
So with two designers, Tolga and Christina, at my office, we took a track --
many of you probably know it. It’s about 25 years old,
and it's David Byrne and Brian Eno --
and we did this little animation.
And I think that it's maybe interesting, also,
that it deals with two problematic issues,
which are rising waters and religion.
Song: Before God destroyed the people on the Earth,
he warned Noah to build an Ark.
And after Noah built his Ark,
I believe he told Noah to warn the people
that they must change all their wicked ways
before he come upon them and destroy them.
And when Noah had done built his Ark,
I understand that somebody began to rend a song.
And the song began to move on I understand like this.
And when Noah had done built his Ark ...
Move on ... In fact ... Concern ...
So they get tired, has come dark and rain; they get weary and tired.
And then he went and knocked an old lady house.
And old lady ran to the door and say, "Who is it?"
Jack say, "Me, Mama-san, could we spend the night here?
Because we’re far from home, we’re very tired."
And the old lady said, "Oh yes, come on in."
It was come dark and rain, will make you weary and tired.
(Applause)
You're looking at a woman
who was publicly silent for a decade.
Obviously, that's changed,
but only recently.
It was several months ago
that I gave my very first
major public talk
at the Forbes 30 Under 30 summit:
1,500 brilliant people,
all under the age of 30.
That meant that in 1998,
the oldest among the group were only 14,
and the youngest, just four.
I joked with them that some
might only have heard of me
from rap songs.
Yes, I'm in rap songs.
Almost 40 rap songs. (Laughter)
But the night of my speech,
a surprising thing happened.
At the age of 41, I was hit on
by a 27-year-old guy.
I know, right?
He was charming and I was flattered,
and I declined.
You know what his
unsuccessful pickup line was?
He could make me feel 22 again.
(Laughter) (Applause)
I realized later that night,
I'm probably the only person over 40
who does not want to be 22 again.
(Laughter)
(Applause)
At the age of 22,
I fell in love with my boss,
and at the age of 24,
I learned the devastating consequences.
Can I see a show of hands of anyone here
who didn't make a mistake
or do something they regretted at 22?
Yep. That's what I thought.
So like me, at 22, a few of you
may have also taken wrong turns
and fallen in love with the wrong person,
maybe even your boss.
Unlike me, though, your boss
probably wasn't the president
of the United States of America.
Of course, life is full of surprises.
Not a day goes by that I'm not
reminded of my mistake,
and I regret that mistake deeply.
In 1998, after having been swept up
into an improbable romance,
I was then swept up into the eye
of a political, legal and media maelstrom
like we had never seen before.
Remember, just a few years earlier,
news was consumed from just three places:
reading a newspaper or magazine,
listening to the radio,
or watching television.
That was it.
But that wasn't my fate.
Instead, this scandal was brought to you
by the digital revolution.
That meant we could access
all the information we wanted,
when we wanted it, anytime, anywhere,
and when the story broke in January 1998,
it broke online.
It was the first time the traditional news
was usurped by the Internet
for a major news story,
a click that reverberated
around the world.
What that meant for me personally
was that overnight I went
from being a completely private figure
to a publicly humiliated one worldwide.
I was patient zero
of losing a personal reputation
on a global scale almost instantaneously.
This rush to judgment,
enabled by technology,
led to mobs of virtual stone-throwers.
Granted, it was before social media,
but people could still comment online,
email stories, and, of course,
email cruel jokes.
News sources plastered
photos of me all over
to sell newspapers, banner ads online,
and to keep people tuned to the TV.
Do you recall a particular image of me,
say, wearing a beret?
Now, I admit I made mistakes,
especially wearing that beret.
But the attention and judgment
that I received, not the story,
but that I personally received,
was unprecedented.
I was branded as a tramp,
tart, slut, whore, bimbo,
and, of course, that woman.
I was seen by many
but actually known by few.
And I get it: it was easy to forget
that that woman was dimensional,
had a soul, and was once unbroken.
When this happened to me 17 years ago,
there was no name for it.
Now we call it cyberbullying
and online harassment.
Today, I want to share
some of my experience with you,
talk about how that experience has helped
shape my cultural observations,
and how I hope my past experience
can lead to a change that results
in less suffering for others.
In 1998, I lost my reputation
and my dignity.
I lost almost everything,
and I almost lost my life.
Let me paint a picture for you.
It is September of 1998.
I'm sitting in a windowless office room
inside the Office
of the Independent Counsel
underneath humming fluorescent lights.
I'm listening to the sound of my voice,
my voice on surreptitiously
taped phone calls
that a supposed friend
had made the year before.
I'm here because
I've been legally required
to personally authenticate
all 20 hours of taped conversation.
For the past eight months,
the mysterious content of these tapes
has hung like the Sword
of Damocles over my head.
I mean, who can remember
what they said a year ago?
Scared and mortified, I listen,
listen as I prattle on
about the flotsam and jetsam of the day;
listen as I confess my love
for the president,
and, of course, my heartbreak;
listen to my sometimes catty,
sometimes churlish, sometimes silly self
being cruel, unforgiving, uncouth;
listen, deeply, deeply ashamed,
to the worst version of myself,
a self I don't even recognize.
A few days later, the Starr Report
is released to Congress,
and all of those tapes and transcripts,
those stolen words, form a part of it.
That people can read the transcripts
is horrific enough,
but a few weeks later,
the audio tapes are aired on TV,
and significant portions
made available online.
The public humiliation was excruciating.
Life was almost unbearable.
This was not something that happened
with regularity back then in 1998,
and by this, I mean the stealing
of people's private words, actions,
conversations or photos,
and then making them public --
public without consent,
public without context,
and public without compassion.
Fast forward 12 years to 2010,
and now social media has been born.
The landscape has sadly become much
more populated with instances like mine,
whether or not someone
actually make a mistake,
and now it's for both public
and private people.
The consequences for some
have become dire, very dire.
I was on the phone with my mom
in September of 2010,
and we were talking about the news
of a young college freshman
from Rutgers University
named Tyler Clementi.
Sweet, sensitive, creative Tyler
was secretly webcammed by his roommate
while being intimate with another man.
When the online world
learned of this incident,
the ridicule and cyberbullying ignited.
A few days later,
Tyler jumped from 
the George Washington Bridge
to his death.
He was 18.
My mom was beside herself about
what happened to Tyler and his family,
and she was gutted with pain
in a way that I just couldn't
quite understand,
and then eventually I realized
she was reliving 1998,
reliving a time when she sat
by my bed every night,
reliving a time when she made me shower
with the bathroom door open,
and reliving a time
when both of my parents feared
that I would be humiliated to death,
literally.
Today, too many parents
haven't had the chance to step in
and rescue their loved ones.
Too many have learned
of their child's suffering and humiliation
after it was too late.
Tyler's tragic, senseless death
was a turning point for me.
It served to recontextualize
my experiences,
and I then began to look at the world
of humiliation and bullying around me
and see something different.
In 1998, we had no way of knowing
where this brave new technology
called the Internet would take us.
Since then, it has connected people
in unimaginable ways,
joining lost siblings,
saving lives, launching revolutions,
but the darkness, cyberbullying,
and slut-shaming that I experienced
had mushroomed.
Every day online, people,
especially young people
who are not developmentally
equipped to handle this,
are so abused and humiliated
that they can't imagine living
to the next day,
and some, tragically, don't,
and there's nothing virtual about that.
ChildLine, a U.K. nonprofit that's focused
on helping young people on various issues,
released a staggering statistic
late last year:
From 2012 to 2013,
there was an 87 percent increase
in calls and emails related
to cyberbullying.
A meta-analysis done
out of the Netherlands
showed that for the first time,
cyberbullying was leading
to suicidal ideations
more significantly than offline bullying.
And you know what shocked me,
although it shouldn't have,
was other research last year
that determined humiliation
was a more intensely felt emotion
than either happiness or even anger.
Cruelty to others is nothing new,
but online, technologically
enhanced shaming is amplified,
uncontained, and permanently accessible.
The echo of embarrassment used to extend
only as far as your family, village,
school or community,
but now it's the online community too.
Millions of people, often anonymously,
can stab you with their words,
and that's a lot of pain,
and there are no perimeters
around how many people
can publicly observe you
and put you in a public stockade.
There is a very personal price
to public humiliation,
and the growth of the Internet
has jacked up that price.
For nearly two decades now,
we have slowly been sowing the seeds
of shame and public humiliation
in our cultural soil,
both on- and offline.
Gossip websites, paparazzi,
reality programming, politics,
news outlets and sometimes hackers
all traffic in shame.
It's led to desensitization
and a permissive environment online
which lends itself to trolling,
invasion of privacy, and cyberbullying.
This shift has created
what Professor Nicolaus Mills calls
a culture of humiliation.
Consider a few prominent examples
just from the past six months alone.
Snapchat, the service which is used
mainly by younger generations
and claims that its messages
only have the lifespan
of a few seconds.
You can imagine the range
of content that that gets.
A third-party app which Snapchatters
use to preserve the lifespan
of the messages was hacked,
and 100,000 personal conversations,
photos, and videos were leaked online
to now have a lifespan of forever.
Jennifer Lawrence and several other actors
had their iCloud accounts hacked,
and private, intimate, nude photos
were plastered across the Internet
without their permission.
One gossip website
had over five million hits
for this one story.
And what about the Sony Pictures
cyberhacking?
The documents which received
the most attention
were private emails that had
maximum public embarrassment value.
But in this culture of humiliation,
there is another kind of price tag
attached to public shaming.
The price does not measure
the cost to the victim,
which Tyler and too many others,
notably women, minorities,
and members of the LGBTQ
community have paid,
but the price measures the profit
of those who prey on them.
This invasion of others is a raw material,
efficiently and ruthlessly mined,
packaged and sold at a profit.
A marketplace has emerged
where public humiliation is a commodity
and shame is an industry.
How is the money made?
Clicks.
The more shame, the more clicks.
The more clicks,
the more advertising dollars.
We're in a dangerous cycle.
The more we click on this kind of gossip,
the more numb we get
to the human lives behind it,
and the more numb we get,
the more we click.
All the while, someone is making money
off of the back 
of someone else's suffering.
With every click, we make a choice.
The more we saturate our culture
with public shaming,
the more accepted it is,
the more we will see behavior
like cyberbullying,
trolling, some forms of hacking,
and online harassment.
Why? Because they all have
humiliation at their cores.
This behavior is a symptom
of the culture we've created.
Just think about it.
Changing behavior begins
with evolving beliefs.
We've seen that to be true
with racism, homophobia,
and plenty of other biases,
today and in the past.
As we've changed beliefs
about same-sex marriage,
more people have been
offered equal freedoms.
When we began valuing sustainability,
more people began to recycle.
So as far as our culture
of humiliation goes,
what we need is a cultural revolution.
Public shaming
as a blood sport has to stop,
and it's time for an intervention
on the Internet and in our culture.
The shift begins with something simple,
but it's not easy.
We need to return to a long-held value
of compassion -- compassion and empathy.
Online, we've got a compassion deficit,
an empathy crisis.
Researcher Brené Brown said, and I quote,
"Shame can't survive empathy."
Shame cannot survive empathy.
I've seen some very dark days in my life,
and it was the compassion and empathy
from my family, friends, professionals,
and sometimes even strangers
that saved me.
Even empathy from one person
can make a difference.
The theory of minority influence,
proposed by social psychologist
Serge Moscovici,
says that even in small numbers,
when there's consistency over time,
change can happen.
In the online world,
we can foster minority influence
by becoming upstanders.
To become an upstander means
instead of bystander apathy,
we can post a positive comment for someone
or report a bullying situation.
Trust me, compassionate comments
help abate the negativity.
We can also counteract the culture
by supporting organizations
that deal with these kinds of issues,
like the Tyler Clementi
Foundation in the U.S.,
In the U.K., there's Anti-Bullying Pro,
and in Australia, there's Project Rockit.
We talk a lot about our right
to freedom of expression,
but we need to talk more about
our responsibility
to freedom of expression.
We all want to be heard,
but let's acknowledge the difference
between speaking up with intention
and speaking up for attention.
The Internet is 
the superhighway for the id,
but online, showing empathy to others
benefits us all and helps create
a safer and better world.
We need to communicate
online with compassion,
consume news with compassion,
and click with compassion.
Just imagine walking a mile
in someone else's headline.
I'd like to end on a personal note.
In the past nine months,
the question I've been 
asked the most is why.
Why now? Why was I 
sticking my head above the parapet?
You can read between the lines
in those questions,
and the answer has nothing
to do with politics.
The top note answer was and is
because it's time:
time to stop tip-toeing around my past;
time to stop living a life of opprobrium;
and time to take back my narrative.
It's also not just about saving myself.
Anyone who is suffering from shame
and public humiliation
needs to know one thing:
You can survive it.
I know it's hard.
It may not be painless, quick or easy,
but you can insist
on a different ending to your story.
Have compassion for yourself.
We all deserve compassion,
and to live both online and off
in a more compassionate world.
Thank you for listening.
(Applause)
So when I do my job, people hate me.
In fact, the better I do my job,
the more people hate me.
And no, I'm not a meter maid,
and I'm not an undertaker.
I am a progressive, lesbian
talking head on Fox News.
(Applause)
So y'all heard that, right?
Just to make sure, right?
I am a gay talking head on Fox News.
I am going to tell you how I do it,
and the most important thing I've learned.
So I go on television.
I debate people who literally want
to obliterate everything I believe in --
in some cases, who don't want
me and people like me to even exist.
It's sort of like Thanksgiving
with your conservative uncle
on steroids,
with a live television
audience of millions.
It's totally almost just like that.
And that's just on air.
The hate mail I get is unbelievable.
Last week alone, I got 238
pieces of nasty email
and more hate tweets
than I can even count.
I was called an idiot,
a traitor, a scourge,
a cunt and an ugly man,
and that was just in one email.
(Laughter)
So what have I realized,
being on the receiving end
of all this ugliness?
Well, my biggest takeaway
is that for decades, we've been focused
on political correctness,
but what matters more
is emotional correctness.
Let me give you a small example.
I don't care if you call me a dyke.
I really don't.
I care about two things.
One, I care that you spell it right.
(Laughter) (Applause)
Just quick refresher, it's D-Y-K-E.
You'd totally be surprised.
And second, I don't care about the word,
I care about how you use it.
Are you being friendly?
Are you just being naive?
Or do you really want
to hurt me personally?
Emotional correctness
is the tone, the feeling,
how we say what we say,
the respect and compassion
we show one another.
And what I've realized
is that political persuasion
doesn't begin with ideas or facts or data.
Political persuasion begins
with being emotionally correct.
So when I first went
to go work at Fox News,
true confession,
I expected there to be marks in the carpet
from all the knuckle-dragging.
That, by the way, in case you're paying
attention, is not emotionally correct.
But liberals on my side,
we can be self-righteous,
we can be condescending,
we can be dismissive of anyone
who doesn't agree with us.
In other words, we can
be politically right
but emotionally wrong.
And incidentally, that means that
people don't like us. Right?
Now here's the kicker.
Conservatives are really nice.
I mean, not all of them,
and not the ones who send me hate mail,
but you would be surprised.
Sean Hannity is one of
the sweetest guys I've ever met.
He spends his free time
trying to fix up his staff on blind dates,
and I know that if I ever had a problem,
he would do anything he could to help.
Now, I think Sean Hannity
is 99 percent politically wrong,
but his emotional correctness
is strikingly impressive.
And that's why people listen to him.
Because you can't get
anyone to agree with you
if they don't even listen to you first.
We spend so much time
talking past each other
and not enough time talking
through our disagreements.
And if we can start to find
compassion for one another,
then we have a shot
at building common ground.
It actually sounds really hokey
to say it standing up here,
but when you try to put it in practice,
it's really powerful.
So someone who says they hate immigrants,
I try to imagine how scared they must be
that their community is changing
from what they've always known.
Or someone who says they
don't like teachers' unions,
I bet they're really devastated to see
their kid's school going into the gutter,
and they're just looking
for someone to blame.
Our challenge is to find
the compassion for others
that we want them to have for us.
That is emotional correctness.
I'm not saying it's easy.
An average of, like, 5.6 times per day
I have to stop myself from responding
to all of my hate mail
with a flurry of vile profanities.
This whole finding compassion
and common ground with your enemies thing
is kind of like a political-spiritual
practice for me,
and I ain't the Dalai Lama.
I'm not perfect,
but what I am is optimistic.
Because I don't just get hate mail.
I get a lot of really nice
letters, lots of them.
And one of my all-time favorites begins:
"I am not a big fan
of your political leanings
or your sometimes tortured logic,
(Laughter)
but I'm a big fan of you as a person."
Now this guy doesn't
agree with me -- yet.
(Laughter)
But he's listening --
not because of what I said,
but because of how I said it.
And somehow, even though we've never met,
we've managed to form a connection.
That's emotional correctness,
and that's how we start the conversations
that really lead to change.
Thank you.
(Applause)

Sophie Hawley-Weld: OK,
you don't have to stand up,
but ...
we can see you really clearly --
(Laughter)
So you have to dance with us.
And we have this, like,
choreographed dance thing
that we're about to do --
Betta Lemme: Really easy.
SHW: And we're going to flick
our wrists like this,
and you're going to do it with us.
And you can also stand up.
(Music)
(Sings) I know I did not raise a wrist
(Both sing) I know I did not capture it
It came, it came,
it went, it went
It conquered quick
I was there and then I quit
Awoo!
I know I did not raise a wrist
I know I did not capture it
It came, it came,
it went, it went
It conquered quick
I was there and then I quit
Awoo!
BL: (Speaks) There you go!
(Music)
SHW: We have another one coming up.
It's a little finger-pointing dance.
(Music)
The people sitting down,
I want to see your fingers pointing.
Yeah!
(Sings) I know I did not raise a wrist
(Both sing) I know I did not capture it
It came, it came,
it went, it went
It conquered quick
I was there and then I quit
Aaaa ...
(Applause)
Awoo!
(Music)
(Clapping to the beat)
(Music)
Aaaa ...
SHW: (Speaks) Alright, hand flick.
(Both sing) I know
I did not raise a wrist
I know I did not capture it
It came, it came,
it went, it went
It conquered quick
I was there and then I quit
I know I did not raise a wrist
I know I did not capture it

By the end of this year,
there'll be nearly a billion people on this planet
that actively use social networking sites.
The one thing that all of them have in common
is that they're going to die.
While that might be a somewhat morbid thought,
I think it has some really profound implications
that are worth exploring.
What first got me thinking about this
was a blog post authored earlier this year by Derek K. Miller,
who was a science and technology journalist
who died of cancer.
And what Miller did was have his family and friends write a post
that went out shortly after he died.
Here's what he wrote in starting that out.
He said, "Here it is. I'm dead,
and this is my last post to my blog.
In advance, I asked that once my body finally shut down
from the punishments of my cancer,
then my family and friends publish this prepared message I wrote --
the first part of the process
of turning this from an active website to an archive."
Now, while as a journalist,
Miller's archive may have been better written
and more carefully curated than most,
the fact of the matter is that all of us today
are creating an archive
that's something completely different
than anything that's been created
by any previous generation.
Consider a few stats for a moment.
Right now there are 48 hours of video
being uploaded to YouTube every single minute.
There are 200 million Tweets being posted every day.
And the average Facebook user
is creating 90 pieces of content each month.
So when you think about your parents or your grandparents,
at best they may have created
some photos or home videos,
or a diary that lives in a box somewhere.
But today we're all creating this incredibly rich digital archive
that's going to live in the cloud indefinitely,
years after we're gone.
And I think that's going to create some incredibly intriguing opportunities
for technologists.
Now to be clear, I'm a journalist and not a technologist,
so what I'd like to do briefly
is paint a picture
of what the present and the future are going to look like.
Now we're already seeing some services
that are designed to let us decide
what happens to our online profile and our social media accounts
after we die.
One of them actually, fittingly enough,
found me when I checked into a deli
at a restaurant in New York
on foursquare.
(Recording) Adam Ostrow: Hello.
Death: Adam?
AO: Yeah.
Death: Death can catch you anywhere, anytime,
even at the Organic.
AO: Who is this?
Death: Go to ifidie.net
before it's too late.
(Laughter)
Adam Ostrow: Kind of creepy, right?
So what that service does, quite simply,
is let you create a message or a video
that can be posted to Facebook after you die.
Another service right now
is called 1,000 Memories.
And what this lets you do is create an online tribute to your loved ones,
complete with photos and videos and stories
that they can post after you die.
But what I think comes next is far more interesting.
Now a lot of you are probably familiar with Deb Roy
who, back in March,
demonstrated how he was able to analyze more than 90,000 hours of home video.
I think as machines' ability
to understand human language and process vast amounts of data
continues to improve,
it's going to become possible
to analyze an entire life's worth of content --
the Tweets, the photos, the videos, the blog posts --
that we're producing in such massive numbers.
And I think as that happens,
it's going to become possible for our digital personas
to continue to interact in the real world long after we're gone
thanks to the vastness of the amount of content we're creating
and technology's ability to make sense of it all.
Now we're already starting to see some experiments here.
One service called My Next Tweet
analyzes your entire Twitter stream, everything you've posted onto Twitter,
to make some predictions as to what you might say next.
Well right now, as you can see,
the results can be somewhat comical.
You can imagine what something like this might look like
five, 10 or 20 years from now
as our technical capabilities improve.
Taking it a step further,
MIT's media lab is working on robots
that can interact more like humans.
But what if those robots were able to interact
based on the unique characteristics of a specific person
based on the hundreds of thousands of pieces of content
that person produces in their lifetime?
Finally, think back to this famous scene
from election night 2008
back in the United States,
where CNN beamed a live hologram
of hip hop artist will.i.am into their studio
for an interview with Anderson Cooper.
What if we were able to use that same type of technology
to beam a representation of our loved ones into our living rooms --
interacting in a very lifelike way
based on all the content they created while they were alive?
I think that's going to become completely possible
as the amount of data we're producing
and technology's ability to understand it
both expand exponentially.
Now in closing, I think what we all need to be thinking about
is if we want that to become our reality --
and if so,
what it means for a definition of life and everything that comes after it.
Thank you very much.

Thandiswa Mazwai: Hello everybody.
Thank you so much for having us here.
My name is Thandiswa Mazwai.
I am a wild woman,
a rebel singer, a conduit.
My music is about memory
and struggling between
oppresion and freedom.
After over 20 years in South Africa
we find ourselves as the black masses
still suffering and fighting
for our freedom and humanity.
This first song was called "Iyeza"
which means "medicine."
Medicine for our madness,
medicine for our rage.
This song we're doing now
is called "Zabalaza,"
and it means "rebel."
I'd like to dedicate this to the valiant
student movement in South Africa
who came up with the #FeesMustFall.
(Applause)
Rhodes Must Fall.
(Applause)
But more importantly,
the new vigor that has been brought
into the feminist movement
so patriarchy must fall.

So a couple of years ago I started a program
to try to get the rockstar tech and design people
to take a year off
and work in the one environment
that represents pretty much everything they're supposed to hate;
we have them work in government.
The program is called Code for America,
and it's a little bit like a Peace Corps for geeks.
We select a few fellows every year
and we have them work with city governments.
Instead of sending them off into the Third World,
we send them into the wilds of City Hall.
And there they make great apps, they work with city staffers.
But really what they're doing is they're showing what's possible
with technology today.
So meet Al.
Al is a fire hydrant in the city of Boston.
Here it kind of looks like he's looking for a date,
but what he's really looking for is for someone to shovel him out when he gets snowed in,
because he knows he's not very good at fighting fires
when he's covered in four feet of snow.
Now how did he come to be looking for help
in this very unique manner?
We had a team of fellows in Boston last year
through the Code for America program.
They were there in February, and it snowed a lot in February last year.
And they noticed that the city never gets
to digging out these fire hydrants.
But one fellow in particular,
a guy named Erik Michaels-Ober,
noticed something else,
and that's that citizens are shoveling out sidewalks
right in front of these things.
So he did what any good developer would do,
he wrote an app.
It's a cute little app where you can adopt a fire hydrant.
So you agree to dig it out when it snows.
If you do, you get to name it,
and he called the first one Al.
And if you don't, someone can steal it from you.
So it's got cute little game dynamics on it.
This is a modest little app.
It's probably the smallest
of the 21 apps that the fellows wrote last year.
But it's doing something
that no other government technology does.
It's spreading virally.
There's a guy in the I.T. department of the City of Honolulu
who saw this app and realized
that he could use it, not for snow,
but to get citizens to adopt tsunami sirens.
It's very important that these tsunami sirens work,
but people steal the batteries out of them.
So he's getting citizens to check on them.
And then Seattle decided to use it
to get citizens to clear out clogged storm drains.
And Chicago just rolled it out
to get people to sign up to shovel sidewalks when it snows.
So we now know of nine cities
that are planning to use this.
And this has spread just frictionlessly,
organically, naturally.
If you know anything about government technology,
you know that this isn't how it normally goes.
Procuring software usually takes a couple of years.
We had a team that worked on a project in Boston last year
that took three people about two and a half months.
It was a way that parents could figure out
which were the right public schools for their kids.
We were told afterward that if that had gone through normal channels,
it would have taken at least two years
and it would have cost about two million dollars.
And that's nothing.
There is one project in the California court system right now
that so far cost taxpayers
two billion dollars,
and it doesn't work.
And there are projects like this
at every level of government.
So an app that takes a couple of days to write
and then spreads virally,
that's sort of a shot across the bow
to the institution of government.
It suggests how government could work better --
not more like a private company,
as many people think it should.
And not even like a tech company,
but more like the Internet itself.
And that means permissionless,
it means open, it means generative.
And that's important.
But what's more important about this app
is that it represents how a new generation
is tackling the problem of government --
not as the problem of an ossified institution,
but as a problem of collective action.
And that's great news,
because, it turns out, we're very good at collective action
with digital technology.
Now there's a very large community of people
that are building the tools that we need
to do things together effectively.
It's not just Code for America fellows,
there are hundreds of people all over the country
that are standing and writing civic apps
every day in their own communities.
They haven't given up on government.
They are frustrated as hell with it,
but they're not complaining about it,
they're fixing it.
And these folks know something
that we've lost sight of.
And that's that when you strip away all your feelings
about politics and the line at the DMV
and all those other things
that we're really mad about,
government is, at its core,
in the words of Tim O'Reilly,
"What we do together that we can't do alone."
Now a lot of people have given up on government.
And if you're one of those people,
I would ask that you reconsider,
because things are changing.
Politics is not changing;
government is changing.
And because government
ultimately derives its power from us --
remember "We the people?" --
how we think about it
is going to effect how that change happens.
Now I didn't know very much about government when I started this program.
And like a lot of people,
I thought government was basically about getting people elected to office.
Well after two years, I've come to the conclusion
that, especially local government,
is about opossums.
This is the call center for the services and information line.
It's generally where you will get
if you call 311 in your city.
If you should ever have the chance
to staff your city's call center,
as our fellow Scott Silverman did as part of the program --
in fact, they all do that --
you will find that people call government
with a very wide range of issues,
including having an opossum stuck in your house.
So Scott gets this call.
He types "Opossum" into this official knowledge base.
He doesn't really come up with anything. He starts with animal control.
And finally, he says, "Look, can you just open all the doors to your house
and play music really loud
and see if the thing leaves?"
So that worked. So booya for Scott.
But that wasn't the end of the opossums.
Boston doesn't just have a call center.
It has an app, a Web and mobile app,
called Citizens Connect.
Now we didn't write this app.
This is the work of the very smart people
at the Office of New Urban Mechanics in Boston.
So one day -- this is an actual report -- this came in:
"Opossum in my trashcan. Can't tell if it's dead.
How do I get this removed?"
But what happens with Citizens Connect is different.
So Scott was speaking person-to-person.
But on Citizens Connect everything is public,
so everybody can see this.
And in this case, a neighbor saw it.
And the next report we got said,
"I walked over to this location,
found the trashcan behind the house.
Opossum? Check. Living? Yep.
Turned trashcan on its side. Walked home.
Goodnight sweet opossum."
(Laughter)
Pretty simple.
So this is great. This is the digital meeting the physical.
And it's also a great example
of government getting in on the crowd-sourcing game.
But it's also a great example of government as a platform.
And I don't mean necessarily
a technological definition of platform here.
I'm just talking about a platform for people
to help themselves and to help others.
So one citizen helped another citizen,
but government played a key role here.
It connected those two people.
And it could have connected them with government services if they'd been needed,
but a neighbor is a far better and cheaper alternative
to government services.
When one neighbor helps another,
we strengthen our communities.
We call animal control, it just costs a lot of money.
Now one of the important things we need to think about government
is that it's not the same thing as politics.
And most people get that,
but they think that one is the input to the other.
That our input to the system of government
is voting.
Now how many times have we elected a political leader --
and sometimes we spend a lot of energy
getting a new political leader elected --
and then we sit back and we expect government
to reflect our values and meet our needs,
and then not that much changes?
That's because government is like a vast ocean
and politics is the six-inch layer on top.
And what's under that
is what we call bureaucracy.
And we say that word with such contempt.
But it's that contempt
that keeps this thing that we own
and we pay for
as something that's working against us, this other thing,
and then we're disempowering ourselves.
People seem to think politics is sexy.
If we want this institution to work for us,
we're going to have to make bureaucracy sexy.
Because that's where the real work of government happens.
We have to engage with the machinery of government.
So that's OccupytheSEC movement has done.
Have you seen these guys?
It's a group of concerned citizens
that have written a very detailed
325-page report
that's a response to the SEC's request for comment
on the Financial Reform Bill.
That's not being politically active,
that's being bureaucratically active.
Now for those of us who've given up on government,
it's time that we asked ourselves
about the world that we want to leave for our children.
You have to see the enormous challenges
that they're going to face.
Do we really think we're going to get where we need to go
without fixing the one institution
that can act on behalf of all of us?
We can't do without government,
but we do need it
to be more effective.
The good news is that technology is making it possible
to fundamentally reframe
the function of government
in a way that can actually scale
by strengthening civil society.
And there's a generation out there that's grown up on the Internet,
and they know that it's not that hard
to do things together,
you just have to architect the systems the right way.
Now the average age of our fellows is 28,
so I am, begrudgingly,
almost a generation older than most of them.
This is a generation
that's grown up taking their voices pretty much for granted.
They're not fighting that battle that we're all fighting
about who gets to speak;
they all get to speak.
They can express their opinion
on any channel at any time,
and they do.
So when they're faced with the problem of government,
they don't care as much
about using their voices.
They're using their hands.
They're using their hands
to write applications that make government work better.
And those applications let us use our hands
to make our communities better.
That could be shoveling out a hydrant, pulling a weed,
turning over a garbage can with an opossum in it.
And certainly, we could have been shoveling out those fire hydrants all along,
and many people do.
But these apps are like little digital reminders
that we're not just consumers,
and we're not just consumers of government,
putting in our taxes and getting back services.
We're more than that,
we're citizens.
And we're not going to fix government
until we fix citizenship.
So the question I have for all of you here:
When it comes to the big, important things
that we need to do together,
all of us together,
are we just going to be a crowd of voices,
or are we also going to be
a crowd of hands?
Thank you.
(Applause)
Last year, I went on my first book tour.
In 13 months, I flew to 14 countries
and gave some hundred talks.
Every talk in every country
began with an introduction,
and every introduction began,
alas, with a lie:
"Taiye Selasi comes
from Ghana and Nigeria,"
or "Taiye Selasi comes
from England and the States."
Whenever I heard this opening sentence,
no matter the country that concluded it --
England, America, Ghana, Nigeria --
I thought, "But that's not true."
Yes, I was born in England
and grew up in the United States.
My mum, born in England,
and raised in Nigeria,
currently lives in Ghana.
My father was born in Gold Coast,
a British colony,
raised in Ghana,
and has lived for over 30 years
in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
For this reason, my introducers
also called me "multinational."
"But Nike is multinational," I thought,
"I'm a human being."
Then, one fine day, mid-tour,
I went to Louisiana, a museum in Denmark
where I shared the stage
with the writer Colum McCann.
We were discussing the role
of locality in writing,
when suddenly it hit me.
I'm not multinational.
I'm not a national at all.
How could I come from a nation?
How can a human being come from a concept?
It's a question that had been bothering me
for going on two decades.
From newspapers, textbooks, conversations,
I had learned to speak of countries
as if they were eternal, singular,
naturally occurring things,
but I wondered:
to say that I came from a country
suggested that the country
was an absolute,
some fixed point in place in time,
a constant thing, but was it?
In my lifetime, countries
had disappeared -- Czechoslovakia;
appeared -- Timor-Leste;
failed -- Somalia.
My parents came from countries
that didn't exist when they were born.
To me, a country -- this thing that could
be born, die, expand, contract --
hardly seemed the basis
for understanding a human being.
And so it came as a huge relief
to discover the sovereign state.
What we call countries are actually
various expressions
of sovereign statehood,
an idea that came into fashion
only 400 years ago.
When I learned this, beginning my
masters degree in international relations,
I felt a sort of surge of relief.
It was as I had suspected.
History was real, cultures were real,
but countries were invented.
For the next 10 years, I sought
to re- or un-define myself,
my world, my work, my experience,
beyond the logic of the state.
In 2005, I wrote an essay,
"What is an Afropolitan,"
sketching out an identity
that privileged culture over country.
It was thrilling how many people
could relate to my experience,
and instructional how many others
didn't buy my sense of self.
"How can Selasi claim to come from Ghana,"
one such critic asked,
"when she's never known the indignities
of traveling abroad
on a Ghanian passport?"
Now, if I'm honest,
I knew just what she meant.
I've got a friend named Layla
who was born and raised in Ghana.
Her parents are third-generation
Ghanians of Lebanese descent.
Layla, who speaks fluent Twi,
knows Accra like the back of her hand,
but when we first met years ago,
I thought, "She's not from Ghana."
In my mind, she came from Lebanon,
despite the patent fact
that all her formative experience
took place in suburban Accra.
I, like my critics,
was imagining some Ghana
where all Ghanaians had brown skin
or none held U.K. passports.
I'd fallen into the limiting trap
that the language of coming
from countries sets --
the privileging of a fiction,
the singular country,
over reality: human experience.
Speaking with Colum McCann that day,
the penny finally dropped.
"All experience is local," he said.
"All identity is experience," I thought.
"I'm not a national,"
I proclaimed onstage.
"I'm a local. I'm multi-local."
See, "Taiye Selasi comes
from the United States," isn't the truth.
I have no relationship
with the United States,
all 50 of them, not really.
My relationship is with Brookline,
the town where I grew up;
with New York City, where I started work;
with Lawrenceville,
where I spend Thanksgiving.
What makes America home for me
is not my passport or accent,
but these very particular experiences
and the places they occur.
Despite my pride in Ewe culture,
the Black Stars,
and my love of Ghanaian food,
I've never had a relationship
with the Republic of Ghana, writ large.
My relationship is with Accra,
where my mother lives,
where I go each year,
with the little garden in Dzorwulu
where my father and I talk for hours.
These are the places
that shape my experience.
My experience is where I'm from.
What if we asked, instead
of "Where are you from?" --
"Where are you a local?"
This would tell us so much more
about who and how similar we are.
Tell me you're from France,
and I see what, a set of clichés?
Adichie's dangerous single story,
the myth of the nation of France?
Tell me you're a local of Fez and Paris,
better yet, Goutte d'Or, and I see
a set of experiences.
Our experience is where we're from.
So, where are you a local?
I propose a three-step test.
I call these the three "R’s":
rituals, relationships, restrictions.
First, think of your daily rituals,
whatever they may be:
making your coffee, driving to work,
harvesting your crops,
saying your prayers.
What kind of rituals are these?
Where do they occur?
In what city or cities in the world
do shopkeepers know your face?
As a child, I carried out fairly standard
suburban rituals in Boston,
with adjustments made for the rituals
my mother brought from London and Lagos.
We took off our shoes in the house,
we were unfailingly
polite with our elders,
we ate slow-cooked, spicy food.
In snowy North America,
ours were rituals of the global South.
The first time I went to Delhi
or to southern parts of Italy,
I was shocked by how at home I felt.
The rituals were familiar.
"R" number one, rituals.
Now, think of your relationships,
of the people who shape your days.
To whom do you speak at least once a week,
be it face to face or on FaceTime?
Be reasonable in your assessment;
I'm not talking about
your Facebook friends.
I'm speaking of the people who shape
your weekly emotional experience.
My mother in Accra,
my twin sister in Boston,
my best friends in New York:
these relationships are home for me.
"R" number two, relationships.
We're local where we carry out
our rituals and relationships,
but how we experience our locality
depends in part on our restrictions.
By restrictions, I mean,
where are you able to live?
What passport do you hold?
Are you restricted by, say, racism,
from feeling fully at home where you live?
By civil war, dysfunctional governance,
economic inflation,
from living in the locality
where you had your rituals as a child?
This is the least sexy of the R’s,
less lyric than rituals and relationships,
but the question takes us past
"Where are you now?"
to "Why aren't you there, and why?"
Rituals, relationships, restrictions.
Take a piece of paper
and put those three words
on top of three columns,
then try to fill those columns
as honestly as you can.
A very different picture
of your life in local context,
of your identity as a set of experiences,
may emerge.
So let's try it.
I have a friend named Olu.
He's 35 years old.
His parents, born in Nigeria,
came to Germany on scholarships.
Olu was born in Nuremberg
and lived there until age 10.
When his family moved to Lagos,
he studied in London,
then came to Berlin.
He loves going to Nigeria --
the weather, the food, the friends --
but hates the political corruption there.
Where is Olu from?
I have another friend named Udo.
He's also 35 years old.
Udo was born in Córdoba,
in northwest Argentina,
where his grandparents migrated
from Germany, what is now Poland,
after the war.
Udo studied in Buenos Aires,
and nine years ago came to Berlin.
He loves going to Argentina -- 
the weather, the food, the friends --
but hates the economic corruption there.
Where is Udo from?
With his blonde hair and blue eyes,
Udo could pass for German,
but holds an Argentinian passport,
so needs a visa to live in Berlin.
That Udo is from Argentina
has largely to do with history.
That he's a local
of Buenos Aires and Berlin,
that has to do with life.
Olu, who looks Nigerian,
needs a visa to visit Nigeria.
He speaks Yoruba with an English accent,
and English with a German one.
To claim that he's
"not really Nigerian," though,
denies his experience in Lagos,
the rituals he practiced growing up,
his relationship with family and friends.
Meanwhile, though Lagos
is undoubtedly one of his homes,
Olu always feels restricted there,
not least by the fact that he's gay.
Both he and Udo are restricted
by the political conditions
of their parents' countries,
from living where some of their
most meaningful rituals
and relationships occur.
To say Olu is from Nigeria
and Udo is from Argentina
distracts from their common experience.
Their rituals, their relationships,
and their restrictions are the same.
Of course, when we ask,
"Where are you from?"
we're using a kind of shorthand.
It's quicker to say "Nigeria"
than "Lagos and Berlin,"
and as with Google Maps,
we can always zoom in closer,
from country to city to neighborhood.
But that's not quite the point.
The difference between
"Where are you from?"
and "Where are you a local?"
isn't the specificity of the answer;
it's the intention of the question.
Replacing the language of nationality
with the language of locality asks us
to shift our focus
to where real life occurs.
Even that most glorious expression
of countryhood, the World Cup,
gives us national teams comprised
mostly of multilocal players.
As a unit of measurement
for human experience,
the country doesn't quite work.
That's why Olu says, "I'm German,
but my parents come from Nigeria."
The "but" in that sentence
belies the inflexibility of the units,
one fixed and fictional entity
bumping up against another.
"I'm a local of Lagos and Berlin,"
suggests overlapping experiences,
layers that merge together,
that can't be denied or removed.
You can take away my passport,
but you can't take away my experience.
That I carry within me.
Where I'm from comes wherever I go.
To be clear, I'm not suggesting
that we do away with countries.
There's much to be said
for national history,
more for the sovereign state.
Culture exists in community,
and community exists in context.
Geography, tradition, collective memory:
these things are important.
What I'm questioning is primacy.
All of those introductions on tour
began with reference to nation,
as if knowing what country I came
from would tell my audience who I was.
What are we really seeking, though,
when we ask where someone comes from?
And what are we really seeing
when we hear an answer?
Here's one possibility:
basically, countries represent power.
"Where are you from?"
Mexico. Poland. Bangladesh. Less power.
America. Germany. Japan. More power.
China. Russia. Ambiguous.
(Laughter)
It's possible that without realizing it,
we're playing a power game,
especially in the context
of multi-ethnic countries.
As any recent immigrant knows,
the question "Where are you from?"
or "Where are you really from?"
is often code for "Why are you here?"
Then we have the scholar
William Deresiewicz's writing
of elite American colleges.
"Students think that
their environment is diverse
if one comes from Missouri
and another from Pakistan --
never mind that all of their parents
are doctors or bankers."
I'm with him.
To call one student American,
another Pakistani,
then triumphantly claim
student body diversity
ignores the fact that these students
are locals of the same milieu.
The same holds true on the other end
of the economic spectrum.
A Mexican gardener in Los Angeles
and a Nepali housekeeper in Delhi
have more in common
in terms of rituals and restrictions
than nationality implies.
Perhaps my biggest problem
with coming from countries
is the myth of going back to them.
I'm often asked if I plan
to "go back" to Ghana.
I go to Accra every year,
but I can't "go back" to Ghana.
It's not because I wasn't born there.
My father can't go back, either.
The country in which he was born,
that country no longer exists.
We can never go back to a place
and find it exactly where we left it.
Something, somewhere
will always have changed,
most of all, ourselves.
People.
Finally, what we're talking
about is human experience,
this notoriously and gloriously
disorderly affair.
In creative writing,
locality bespeaks humanity.
The more we know
about where a story is set,
the more local color and texture,
the more human
the characters start to feel,
the more relatable, not less.
The myth of national identity
and the vocabulary of coming from
confuses us into placing ourselves
into mutually exclusive categories.
In fact, all of us are multi --
multi-local, multi-layered.
To begin our conversations
with an acknowledgement of this complexity
brings us closer together, I think,
not further apart.
So the next time that I'm introduced,
I'd love to hear the truth:
"Taiye Selasi is a human being,
like everybody here.
She isn't a citizen of the world,
but a citizen of worlds.
She is a local of New York,
Rome and Accra."
Thank you.
(Applause)
It was June 2014.
I was 30 years old,
and I received a call
from my doctor's office
to say my test results were in.
So I walked up to see her
in my lunch break, and my doctor said
she was very sorry to tell me
that I had breast cancer.
I didn't want to believe her
and at first, I didn't.
You see, I'm a lawyer
and I needed some evidence.
So I'm very embarrassed to tell you all
that I stood up and I walked around
to where she was sitting
so that I could look
over her shoulder and verify
what was written
on the page in front of her.
(Laughter)
Malignant carcinoma.
But still not wanting
to believe it, I said,
"Now, malignant carcinoma,
you're sure that means cancer?"
(Laughter)
She told me she was sure.
Back at work, I handed over
the urgent things that needed to be done
while I was having more tests
to see if my cancer had spread.
But at that moment,
work wasn't my priority.
I was thinking about how I was going
to tell my family and friends
that I had cancer.
How I was going to answer their questions
about how bad it was
and whether I was going to be OK,
when I didn't know that myself.
I was wondering if my partner and I
would ever have an opportunity
to start a family.
And I was figuring out
how I was going to tell my mother,
who had herself had breast cancer
when she was pregnant with me.
She would know how I was feeling
and have an idea of what lay ahead for me.
But I also didn't want her
to have to relive her cancer experience.
What I didn't appreciate at the time
was that work was about to play
a huge role in my treatment and recovery.
That it would be my coworkers and my job
that would make me feel valuable and human
at times when I would have
otherwise felt like a statistic.
That it would be my job
that would give me routine and stability
when I was dealing with so many
difficult personal decisions
and so much uncertainty.
Like, what sort of breast
reconstruction I was going to have.
And at a time like that,
you would think that I would turn
to my family and friends for support.
And yes, of course I did that.
But it would ultimately be my colleagues
who would play a huge role
in my day-to-day life.
And they would be
the ones to make me laugh.
You see, we were a pretty close team,
and we shared a couple
of really good in-jokes,
like this time they overheard
someone ask me
how I got my hair so shiny and perfect --
without knowing that it was,
of course, a wig,
and you know, it was a very good wig
and it did make getting ready
in the mornings very easy.
(Laughter)
But in little moments like this,
I appreciated what their support meant,
and I wondered what I would
have done without that network.
I've spoken with so many people,
women in particular,
who haven't had the chance
to have that network
because they haven't been given
the opportunity to work through treatment.
And there are several reasons for this.
But I think it mostly comes down
to overly paternalistic employers.
These employers want you to go away
and focus on yourself.
And come back when you're better.
And they use those kinds of phrases.
And while these responses
are well-meaning,
knowing the benefits it brought me,
it makes me incredibly frustrated
when people are told
that they couldn’t or shouldn't work,
when it's something that they want to do
and physically can do.
So I started to look into
what an employer is required to do
when someone presents
with a cancer diagnosis.
I discovered that under Australian law,
cancer is considered a disability.
So if you are unable to perform
your usual work duties,
your employer is obligated
by the Disability Discrimination Act
to make reasonable adjustments
to your working arrangements,
so that you can continue to work.
What would reasonable
adjustments look like for me?
I knew the obvious impacts
my diagnosis was going to have on work.
Medical appointments would be scheduled
during business hours,
and I knew that I would need time off
to recover from surgical procedures.
Again, being a typical lawyer,
I had done my due diligence
on what to expect from treatment.
Admittedly, a lot of that
was through Doctor Google,
perhaps not my best move
and I wouldn't recommend that.
(Laughter)
But while I was ready
for all the physical side effects,
what really scared me
was this thing called chemo brain.
Chemo brain presents itself
through memory loss,
an inability to concentrate
and an inability to solve problems.
And if this happened to me,
I wondered how I was going to do
my job as a lawyer.
Would I be forced to leave work?
And how could I possibly
have a discussion with my manager
about reasonable adjustments
to my working arrangements
when I didn't know
how I was going to be impacted?
I was fortunate to have
a supportive manager
who was happy to see
how things went as we went along,
rather than requiring
a concrete plan up front.
I was lucky that while
he may not have even known
about this concept
of reasonable adjustments,
to him, it was just common sense.
But I've learned that it's not
common sense to everyone.
Everyone going through treatment
will learn how it impacts them
and what their limitations are.
And they'll learn to adjust for that.
So for me, there were the tips and tricks
that I learned about the treatment itself,
like, before you go to chemo,
you need to make sure
you're really well hydrated
and that you're warm, because it helps
the nurses to find your veins.
And make sure that you don't eat
any of your favorite food,
either before or after chemo,
because you're going to be
throwing that up
and you won't ever
want to look at it again.
(Laughter)
I learned that one the hard way.
And then there were the tricks
for managing my workflow.
I scheduled chemo for first thing
on a Monday morning.
I knew that from the time
I left the cancer care unit,
I had about four hours
before this fog screen would come down
and I would start to be sick.
So I would use that time to clean my inbox
and make any urgent calls.
The worst of the sickness would be gone
within about 48 hours.
And then I would log back
into work from home.
This treatment continued
and I knew what to expect.
I was able to set reasonable expectations
with my business partners
about what I could do
and the time frames that I could do it in.
But I still remember
the hesitation in their voices
when it came to asking for things.
And asking me to do things
by a certain time.
And trust me, these were people
that were not afraid
of setting a good deadline.
(Laughter)
I got the impression they didn't want
to put any extra pressure on me
while I was going through treatment.
And while I appreciated the sentiment,
I actually needed the deadlines.
To me, that was something
within my control
and something
that could stay in my control
when there were so many
things that couldn't.
And as I was working from home,
I was thinking about how employers
should be applying this concept
of reasonable adjustments
in our current age,
where one in two Australian men and women
will be diagnosed with cancer
by the age of 85.
So, as we continue to work
longer and longer into older age,
the chances of having a serious illness
while we're in the workforce
are increasing.
And with technology enabling us
to work anywhere, any time,
reasonable adjustments
are no longer contingent upon
whether or not you can continue
to physically make it
into the physical office.
Reasonable adjustments are also not about
just offering a longer break
or a comfier chair to sit in,
although those things might be good, too.
At the very least,
we need to be applying
the flexibility policies and strategies
we've developed for other scenarios,
like for people
with family responsibilities.
But how can we ensure that people
are even having a conversation
about what reasonable adjustments
might look like for them
if a manager's first response is to say,
"Oh no, don't come back to work
until you're better."
And a light went on for me.
It must be compulsory for managers
to have to have these conversations
with their employees.
And lessons from people like me,
that have really benefited
from working through treatment,
need to be more widely shared.
And I thought about what could be done
to guide these conversations,
and then an amazing
colleague of mine, Camilla Gunn,
developed a "Working with Cancer" toolkit.
The toolkit provides a framework
for those diagnosed,
their managers, their carers
and their coworkers
to have conversations about cancer
and the work support available.
Camilla and I have now been
to other organizations
to talk about the toolkit
and how it can help to guide through
what, quite frankly, are otherwise
some pretty awkward conversations.
And I'm pleased to say that the uptake
of the toolkit is increasing.
So what should be
a manager's first response
when somebody says that they're sick
and they don't know
how it's going to impact their work?
It must be this:
"To the extent that you
are able, and want to,
we would love to work out
an arrangement for you
to continue to work through treatment."
We need to start positively engaging
people with serious illness
to keep them in the workforce,
rather than paternalistically
pushing them away.
I've told you my story
because I want you to know the benefits
that working through treatment brought me.
And I also want to change your perceptions
if you think that somebody
going through treatment
is just bored, frail and vomiting a lot.
And yes, these things
were true some of the time,
if not a lot of the time,
but I was also determined
to push myself at work
as much as I had always done.
And I was able to do that
because my employer gave me the choice.
Most importantly, I'm telling you
because while it's a seemingly
obvious choice to give someone,
it's not one that is always
offered or encouraged.
And it must be.
Thank you.
(Applause)
I told you three things last year.
I told you that the statistics of the world
have not been made properly available.
Because of that, we still have the old mindset
of developing in industrialized countries, which is wrong.
And that animated graphics can make a difference.
Things are changing
and today, on the United Nations Statistic Division Home Page,
it says, by first of May, full access to the databases.
(Applause)
And if I could share the image with you on the screen.
So three things have happened.
U.N. opened their statistic databases,
and we have a new version of the software
up working as a beta on the net,
so you don't have to download it any longer.
And let me repeat what you saw last year.
The bubbles are the countries.
Here you have the fertility rate -- the number of children per woman --
and there you have the length of life in years.
This is 1950 -- those were the industrialized countries,
those were developing countries.
At that time there was a "we" and "them."
There was a huge difference in the world.
But then it changed, and it went on quite well.
And this is what happens.
You can see how China is the red, big bubble.
The blue there is India.
And they go over all this -- I'm going to try to be
a little more serious this year in showing you
how things really changed.
And it's Africa that stands out as the problem down here, doesn't it?
Large families still, and the HIV epidemic
brought down the countries like this.
This is more or less what we saw last year,
and this is how it will go on into the future.
And I will talk on, is this possible?
Because you see now, I presented statistics that don't exist.
Because this is where we are.
Will it be possible that this will happen?
I cover my lifetime here, you know?
I expect to live 100 years.
And this is where we are today.
Now could we look here instead at the economic situation in the world?
And I would like to show that against child survival.
We'll swap the axis.
Here you have child mortality -- that is, survival --
four kids dying there, 200 dying there.
And this is GDP per capita on this axis.
And this was 2007.
And if I go back in time, I've added some historical statistics --
here we go, here we go, here we go -- not so much statistics 100 years ago.
Some countries still had statistics.
We are looking down in the archive,
and when we are down into 1820,
there is only Austria and Sweden that can produce numbers.
(Laughter)
But they were down here. They had 1,000 dollars per person per year.
And they lost one-fifth of their kids before their first birthday.
So this is what happens in the world, if we play the entire world.
How they got slowly richer and richer,
and they add statistics.
Isn't it beautiful when they get statistics?
You see the importance of that?
And here, children don't live longer.
The last century, 1870, was bad for the kids in Europe,
because most of this statistics is Europe.
It was only by the turn of the century
that more than 90 percent of the children survived their first year.
This is India coming up, with the first data from India.
And this is the United States moving away here, earning more money.
And we will soon see China coming up in the very far end corner here.
And it moves up with Mao Tse-Tung getting health,
not getting so rich.
There he died, then Deng Xiaoping brings money.
It moves this way over here.
And the bubbles keep moving up there,
and this is what the world looks like today.
(Applause)
Let us have a look at the United States.
We have a function here -- I can tell the world, "Stay where you are."
And I take the United States -- we still want to see the background --
I put them up like this, and now we go backwards.
And we can see that the United States
goes to the right of the mainstream.
They are on the money side all the time.
And down in 1915, the United States was a neighbor of India --
present, contemporary India.
And that means United States was richer,
but lost more kids than India is doing today, proportionally.
And look here -- compare to the Philippines of today.
The Philippines of today has almost the same economy
as the United States during the First World War.
But we have to bring United States forward quite a while
to find the same health of the United States
as we have in the Philippines.
About 1957 here, the health of the United States
is the same as the Philippines.
And this is the drama of this world which many call globalized,
is that Asia, Arabic countries, Latin America,
are much more ahead in being healthy, educated,
having human resources than they are economically.
There's a discrepancy in what's happening today
in the emerging economies.
There now, social benefits, social progress,
are going ahead of economical progress.
And 1957 -- the United States had the same economy as Chile has today.
And how long do we have to bring United States
to get the same health as Chile has today?
I think we have to go, there -- we have 2001, or 2002 --
the United States has the same health as Chile.
Chile's catching up!
Within some years Chile may have better child survival
than the United States.
This is really a change, that you have this lag
of more or less 30, 40 years' difference on the health.
And behind the health is the educational level.
And there's a lot of infrastructure things,
and general human resources are there.
Now we can take away this --
and I would like to show you the rate of speed,
the rate of change, how fast they have gone.
And we go back to 1920, and I want to look at Japan.
And I want to look at Sweden and the United States.
And I'm going to stage a race here
between this sort of yellowish Ford here
and the red Toyota down there,
and the brownish Volvo.
(Laughter)
And here we go. Here we go.
The Toyota has a very bad start down here, you can see,
and the United States Ford is going off-road there.
And the Volvo is doing quite fine.
This is the war. The Toyota got off track, and now
the Toyota is coming on the healthier side of Sweden --
can you see that?
And they are taking over Sweden,
and they are now healthier than Sweden.
That's the part where I sold the Volvo and bought the Toyota.
(Laughter)
And now we can see that the rate of change was enormous in Japan.
They really caught up.
And this changes gradually.
We have to look over generations to understand it.
And let me show you my own sort of family history --
we made these graphs here.
And this is the same thing, money down there, and health, you know?
And this is my family.
This is Sweden, 1830, when my great-great-grandma was born.
Sweden was like Sierra Leone today.
And this is when great-grandma was born, 1863.
And Sweden was like Mozambique.
And this is when my grandma was born, 1891.
She took care of me as a child,
so I'm not talking about statistic now --
now it's oral history in my family.
That's when I believe statistics,
when it's grandma-verified statistics.
(Laughter)
I think it's the best way of verifying historical statistics.
Sweden was like Ghana.
It's interesting to see the enormous diversity
within sub-Saharan Africa.
I told you last year, I'll tell you again,
my mother was born in Egypt, and I -- who am I?
I'm the Mexican in the family.
And my daughter, she was born in Chile,
and the grand-daughter was born in Singapore,
now the healthiest country on this Earth.
It bypassed Sweden about two to three years ago,
with better child survival.
But they're very small, you know?
They're so close to the hospital we can never
beat them out in these forests.
(Laughter)
But homage to Singapore.
Singapore is the best one.
Now this looks also like a very good story.
But it's not really that easy, that it's all a good story.
Because I have to show you one of the other facilities.
We can also make the color here represent the variable --
and what am I choosing here?
Carbon-dioxide emission, metric ton per capita.
This is 1962, and United States was emitting 16 tons per person.
And China was emitting 0.6,
and India was emitting 0.32 tons per capita.
And what happens when we moved on?
Well, you see the nice story of getting richer
and getting healthier --
everyone did it at the cost of emission of carbon dioxide.
There is no one who has done it so far.
And we don't have all the updated data
any longer, because this is really hot data today.
And there we are, 2001.
And in the discussion I attended with global leaders, you know,
many say now the problem is that the emerging economies,
they are getting out too much carbon dioxide.
The Minister of the Environment of India said,
"Well, you were the one who caused the problem."
The OECD countries -- the high-income countries --
they were the ones who caused the climate change.
"But we forgive you, because you didn't know it.
But from now on, we count per capita.
From now on we count per capita.
And everyone is responsible for the per capita emission."
This really shows you, we have not seen good economic
and health progress anywhere in the world
without destroying the climate.
And this is really what has to be changed.
I've been criticized for showing you a too positive image of the world,
but I don't think it's like this.
The world is quite a messy place.
This we can call Dollar Street.
Everyone lives on this street here.
What they earn here -- what number they live on --
is how much they earn per day.
This family earns about one dollar per day.
We drive up the street here,
we find a family here which earns about two to three dollars a day.
And we drive away here -- we find the first garden in the street,
and they earn 10 to 50 dollars a day.
And how do they live?
If we look at the bed here, we can see
that they sleep on a rug on the floor.
This is what poverty line is --
80 percent of the family income is just to cover the energy needs,
the food for the day.
This is two to five dollars. You have a bed.
And here it's a much nicer bedroom, you can see.
I lectured on this for Ikea, and they wanted to see
the sofa immediately here.
(Laughter)
And this is the sofa, how it will emerge from there.
And the interesting thing, when you go around here in the photo panorama,
you see the family still sitting on the floor there.
Although there is a sofa,
if you watch in the kitchen, you can see that
the great difference for women does not come between one to 10 dollars.
It comes beyond here, when you really can get
good working conditions in the family.
And if you really want to see the difference,
you look at the toilet over here.
This can change. This can change.
These are all pictures and images from Africa,
and it can become much better.
We can get out of poverty.
My own research has not been in IT or anything like this.
I spent 20 years in interviews with African farmers
who were on the verge of famine.
And this is the result of the farmers-needs research.
The nice thing here is that you can't see
who are the researchers in this picture.
That's when research functions in poor societies --
you must really live with the people.
When you're in poverty, everything is about survival.
It's about having food.
And these two young farmers, they are girls now --
because the parents are dead from HIV and AIDS --
they discuss with a trained agronomist.
This is one of the best agronomists in Malawi, Junatambe Kumbira,
and he's discussing what sort of cassava they will plant --
the best converter of sunshine to food that man has found.
And they are very, very eagerly interested to get advice,
and that's to survive in poverty.
That's one context.
Getting out of poverty.
The women told us one thing. "Get us technology.
We hate this mortar, to stand hours and hours.
Get us a mill so that we can mill our flour,
then we will be able to pay for the rest ourselves."
Technology will bring you out of poverty,
but there's a need for a market to get away from poverty.
And this woman is very happy now, bringing her products to the market.
But she's very thankful for the public investment in schooling
so she can count, and won't be cheated when she reaches the market.
She wants her kid to be healthy, so she can go to the market
and doesn't have to stay home.
And she wants the infrastructure -- it is nice with a paved road.
It's also good with credit.
Micro-credits gave her the bicycle, you know.
And information will tell her when to go to market with which product.
You can do this.
I find my experience from 20 years of Africa is that
the seemingly impossible is possible.
Africa has not done bad.
In 50 years they've gone from a pre-Medieval situation
to a very decent 100-year-ago Europe,
with a functioning nation and state.
I would say that sub-Saharan Africa has done best in the world
during the last 50 years.
Because we don't consider where they came from.
It's this stupid concept of developing countries
that puts us, Argentina and Mozambique together 50 years ago,
and says that Mozambique did worse.
We have to know a little more about the world.
I have a neighbor who knows 200 types of wine.
He knows everything.
He knows the name of the grape, the temperature and everything.
I only know two types of wine -- red and white.
(Laughter)
But my neighbor only knows two types of countries --
industrialized and developing.
And I know 200, I know about the small data.
But you can do that.
(Applause)
But I have to get serious. And how do you get serious?
You make a PowerPoint, you know?
(Laughter)
Homage to the Office package, no?
What is this, what is this, what am I telling?
I'm telling you that there are many dimensions of development.
Everyone wants your pet thing.
If you are in the corporate sector, you love micro-credit.
If you are fighting in a non-governmental organization,
you love equity between gender.
Or if you are a teacher, you'll love UNESCO, and so on.
On the global level, we have to have more than our own thing.
We need everything.
All these things are important for development,
especially when you just get out of poverty
and you should go towards welfare.
Now, what we need to think about
is, what is a goal for development,
and what are the means for development?
Let me first grade what are the most important means.
Economic growth to me, as a public-health professor,
is the most important thing for development
because it explains 80 percent of survival.
Governance. To have a government which functions --
that's what brought California out of the misery of 1850.
It was the government that made law function finally.
Education, human resources are important.
Health is also important, but not that much as a mean.
Environment is important.
Human rights is also important, but it just gets one cross.
Now what about goals? Where are we going toward?
We are not interested in money.
Money is not a goal.
It's the best mean, but I give it zero as a goal.
Governance, well it's fun to vote in a little thing,
but it's not a goal.
And going to school, that's not a goal, it's a mean.
Health I give two points. I mean it's nice to be healthy
-- at my age especially -- you can stand here, you're healthy.
And that's good, it gets two plusses.
Environment is very, very crucial.
There's nothing for the grandkid if you don't save up.
But where are the important goals?
Of course, it's human rights.
Human rights is the goal,
but it's not that strong of a mean for achieving development.
And culture. Culture is the most important thing, I would say,
because that's what brings joy to life.
That's the value of living.
So the seemingly impossible is possible.
Even African countries can achieve this.
And I've shown you the shot where the seemingly impossible is possible.
And remember, please remember my main message,
which is this: the seemingly impossible is possible.
We can have a good world.
I showed you the shots, I proved it in the PowerPoint,
and I think I will convince you also by culture.
(Laughter)
(Applause)
Bring me my sword!
Sword swallowing is from ancient India.
It's a cultural expression that for thousands of years
has inspired human beings to think beyond the obvious.
(Laughter)
And I will now prove to you that the seemingly impossible is possible
by taking this piece of steel -- solid steel --
this is the army bayonet from the Swedish Army, 1850,
in the last year we had war.
And it's all solid steel -- you can hear here.
And I'm going to take this blade of steel,
and push it down through my body of blood and flesh,
and prove to you that the seemingly impossible is possible.
Can I request a moment of absolute silence?
(Applause)
Motor racing is a funny old business.
We make a new car every year,
and then we spend the rest of the season
trying to understand
what it is we've built
to make it better, to make it faster.
And then the next year, we start again.
Now, the car you see in front
of you is quite complicated.
The chassis is made
up of about 11,000 components,
the engine another 6,000,
the electronics
about eight and a half thousand.
So there's about 25,000 things
there that can go wrong.
So motor racing is very much
about attention to detail.
The other thing about Formula
1 in particular
is we're always changing the car.
We're always trying to make it faster.
So every two weeks, we will be making
about 5,000 new components
to fit to the car.
Five to 10 percent of the race car
will be different
every two weeks of the year.
So how do we do that?
Well, we start our life
with the racing car.
We have a lot of sensors
on the car to measure things.
On the race car in front of you here
there are about 120 sensors
when it goes into a race.
It's measuring all sorts
of things around the car.
That data is logged. We're logging about
500 different parameters
within the data systems,
about 13,000 health parameters and events
to say when things are not
working the way they should do,
and we're sending that data
back to the garage
using telemetry at a rate
of two to four megabits per second.
So during a two-hour race,
each car will be sending
750 million numbers.
That's twice as many numbers
as words that each of us
speaks in a lifetime.
It's a huge amount of data.
But it's not enough just
to have data and measure it.
You need to be able to do
something with it.
So we've spent a lot of time and effort
in turning the data into stories
to be able to tell,
what's the state of the engine,
how are the tires degrading,
what's the situation
with fuel consumption?
So all of this is taking data
and turning it into knowledge
that we can act upon.
Okay, so let's have a look
at a little bit of data.
Let's pick a bit of data from
another three-month-old patient.
This is a child, and what you're
seeing here is real data,
and on the far right-hand side,
where everything starts getting
a little bit catastrophic,
that is the patient going
into cardiac arrest.
It was deemed to be
an unpredictable event.
This was a heart attack
that no one could see coming.
But when we look at the information there,
we can see that things
are starting to become
a little fuzzy about five minutes
or so before the cardiac arrest.
We can see small changes
in things like the heart rate moving.
These were all undetected
by normal thresholds
which would be applied to data.
So the question is, why
couldn't we see it?
Was this a predictable event?
Can we look more
at the patterns in the data
to be able to do things better?
So this is a child,
about the same age
as the racing car on stage,
three months old.
It's a patient with a heart problem.
Now, when you look at some of the data
on the screen above,
things like heart rate, pulse,
oxygen, respiration rates,
they're all unusual for a normal child,
but they're quite normal
for the child there,
and so one of the challenges
you have in health care is,
how can I look at the patient
in front of me,
have something which is specific for her,
and be able to detect when
things start to change,
when things start to deteriorate?
Because like a racing car, any patient,
when things start to go
bad, you have a short time
to make a difference.
So what we did is we took a data system
which we run every two weeks
of the year in Formula 1
and we installed it
on the hospital computers
at Birmingham Children's Hospital.
We streamed data
from the bedside instruments
in their pediatric intensive care
so that we could both look
at the data in real time
and, more importantly, to store the data
so that we could start to learn from it.
And then, we applied an application on top
which would allow us to tease
out the patterns in the data
in real time so we could
see what was happening,
so we could determine when
things started to change.
Now, in motor racing, we're
all a little bit ambitious,
audacious, a little bit
arrogant sometimes,
so we decided we would also
look at the children
as they were being transported
to intensive care.
Why should we wait
until they arrived in the hospital
before we started to look?
And so we installed a real-time link
between the ambulance and the hospital,
just using normal 3G
telephony to send that data
so that the ambulance became an extra bed
in intensive care.
And then we started looking at the data.
So the wiggly lines
at the top, all the colors,
this is the normal sort of data
you would see on a monitor --
heart rate, pulse,
oxygen within the blood,
and respiration.
The lines on the bottom,
the blue and the red,
these are the interesting ones.
The red line is showing
an automated version
of the early warning score
that Birmingham Children's Hospital
were already running.
They'd been running that since 2008,
and already have stopped cardiac arrests
and distress within the hospital.
The blue line is an indication
of when patterns start to change,
and immediately, before we even started
putting in clinical interpretation,
we can see that the data
is speaking to us.
It's telling us that something
is going wrong.
The plot with the red and the green blobs,
this is plotting different components
of the data against each other.
The green is us learning
what is normal for that child.
We call it the cloud of normality.
And when things start to change,
when conditions start to deteriorate,
we move into the red line.
There's no rocket science here.
It is displaying data that exists
already in a different way,
to amplify it, to provide
cues to the doctors,
to the nurses, so they can
see what's happening.
In the same way that a good racing driver
relies on cues to decide
when to apply the brakes,
when to turn into a corner,
we need to help
our physicians and our nurses
to see when things
are starting to go wrong.
So we have a very ambitious program.
We think that the race is on to do
something differently.
We are thinking big.
It's the right thing to do.
We have an approach which,
if it's successful,
there's no reason why it
should stay within a hospital.
It can go beyond the walls.
With wireless connectivity these days,
there is no reason why
patients, doctors and nurses
always have to be in the same place
at the same time.
And meanwhile, we'll take
our little three-month-old baby,
keep taking it to the track,
keeping it safe,
and making it faster and better.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
In 2008, Cyclone Nargis devastated Myanmar.
Millions of people were in severe need of help.
The U.N. wanted to rush people and supplies to the area.
But there were no maps, no maps of roads,
no maps showing hospitals, no way for help to reach the cyclone victims.
When we look at a map of Los Angeles or London,
it is hard to believe
that as of 2005, only 15 percent of the world
was mapped to a geo-codable level of detail.
The U.N. ran headfirst into a problem
that the majority of the world's populous faces:
not having detailed maps.
But help was coming.
At Google, 40 volunteers
used a new software
to map 120,000 kilometers of roads,
3,000 hospitals, logistics and relief points.
And it took them four days.
The new software they used? Google Mapmaker.
Google Mapmaker is a technology that empowers each of us
to map what we know locally.
People have used this software
to map everything from roads to rivers,
from schools to local businesses,
and video stores to the corner store.
Maps matter.
Nobel Prize nominee Hernando De Soto
recognized that the key to economic liftoff
for most developing countries
is to tap the vast amounts of uncapitalized land.
For example, a trillion dollars
of real estate remains uncapitalized in India alone.
In the last year alone,
thousands of users in 170 countries
have mapped millions of pieces of information,
and created a map of a level of detail never thought viable.
And this was made possible by
the power of passionate users everywhere.
Let's look at some of the maps
being created by users right now.
So, as we speak, people are mapping the world
in these 170 countries.
You can see Bridget in Africa who just mapped a road in Senegal.
And, closer to home, Chalua, an N.G. road in Bangalore.
This is the result of computational geometry,
gesture recognition, and machine learning.
This is a victory of thousands of users,
in hundreds of cities,
one user, one edit at a time.
This is an invitation to the 70 percent
of our unmapped planet.
Welcome to the new world.
(Applause)
I'm an industrial engineer.
The goal in my life has always been to make
more and more products
in the least amount of time and resources.
While working at Toyota,
all I knew was how to make cars
until I met Dr. Akira Miyawaki,
who came to our factory to make a forest in it
in order to make it carbon-neutral.
I was so fascinated
that I decided to learn this methodology
by joining his team as a volunteer.
Soon, I started making a forest
in the backyard of my own house,
and this is how it looks after three years.
These forests,
compared to a conventional plantation,
grow 10 times faster,
they're 30 times more dense,
and 100 times more biodiverse.
Within two years of having this forest in our backyard,
I could observe that the groundwater
didn't dry during summers,
the number of bird species I spotted in this area
doubled.
Quality of air became better,
and we started harvesting seasonal fruits
growing effortlessly
right in the backyard of our house.
I wanted to make more of these forests.
I was so moved by these results
that I wanted to make these forests
with the same acumen with which we make cars
or write software or do any mainstream business,
so I founded a company
which is an end-to-end service provider
to create these native natural forests.
But to make afforestation as a mainstream business
or an industry, we had to standardize
the process of forest-making.
So we benchmarked the Toyota Production System
known for its quality and efficiency
for the process of forest-making.
For an example, the core of TPS,
Toyota Production System, lies in heijunka,
which is making manufacturing
of different models of cars
on a single assembly line.
We replaced these cars with trees,
using which now we can make multi-layered forests.
These forests utilize 100 percent vertical space.
They are so dense
that one can't even walk into them.
For an example, we can make a 300-tree forest
in an area as small as the parking spaces of six cars.
In order to reduce cost and our own carbon footprint,
we started utilizing local biomass
as soil amender and fertilizers.
For example, coconut shells crushed in a machine
mixed with rice straw,
powder of rice husk mixed with organic manure
is finally dumped in soil on which
our forest is planted.
Once planted, we use grass or rice straw
to cover the soil
so that all the water which goes into irrigation
doesn't get evaporated back into the atmosphere.
And using these simple improvisations,
today we can make a forest
for a cost as low as the cost of an iPhone.
Today, we are making forests in houses,
in schools, even in factories with the corporates.
But that's not enough.
There is a huge number of people
who want to take matters into their own hands.
So we let it happen.
Today, we are working on an Internet-based platform
where we are going to share our methodology
on an open source
using which anyone and everyone
can make their own forest
without our physical presence being there,
using our methodology.
At the click of a button,
they can get to know all the native species
of their place.
By installing a small hardware probe on site,
we can do remote soil testing,
using which we can give step-by-step instructions
on forest-making remotely.
Also we can monitor the growth of this forest
without being on site.
This methodology, I believe,
has a potential.
By sharing, we can actually
bring back our native forests.
Now, when you go back home,
if you see a barren piece of land,
do remember that it can be a potential forest.
Thank you very much. Thanks.
(Applause)
When someone mentions Cuba,
what do you think about?
Classic, classic cars?
Perhaps good cigars?
Maybe you think
of a famous baseball player.
What about when somebody
mentions North Korea?
You think about those missile tests,
maybe their notorious leader
or his good friend, Dennis Rodman.
(Laughter)
One thing that likely doesn't come to mind
is a vision of a country,
an open economy,
whose citizens have access to a wide range
of affordable consumer products.
I'm not here to argue how these countries
got to where they are today.
I simply want to use them
as an example of countries and citizens
who have been affected,
negatively affected,
by a trade policy that restricts imports
and protects local industries.
Recently we've heard a number of countries
talk about restricting imports
and protecting their local,
domestic industries.
Now, this may sound fine in a sound bite,
but what it really is is protectionism.
We heard a lot about this
during the 2016 presidential election.
We heard about it
during the Brexit debates
and most recently
during the French elections.
In fact, it's been
a really important topic
being talked about around the world,
and many aspiring political leaders
are running on platforms
positioning protectionism as a good thing.
Now, I could see why they think
protectionism is good,
because sometimes
it seems like trade is unfair.
Some have blamed trade
for some of the problems
we've been having here at home in the US.
For years we've been hearing
about the loss of high-paying
US manufacturing jobs.
Many think that manufacturing
is declining in the US
because companies are moving
their operations offshore
to markets with lower-cost labor
like China, Mexico and Vietnam.
They also think trade agreements
sometimes are unfair,
like NAFTA
and the Trans-Pacific Partnership,
because these trade agreements
allow companies
to reimport those cheaply
produced goods back into the US
and other countries
from where the jobs were taken.
So it kind of feels like the exporters win
and the importers lose.
Now, the reality is
output in the manufacturing
sector in the US
is actually growing,
but we are losing jobs.
We're losing lots of them.
In fact, from 2000 to 2010,
5.7 million manufacturing jobs were lost.
But they're not being lost
for the reasons you might think.
Mike Johnson in Toledo, Ohio
didn't lose his jobs at the factory
to Miguel Sanchez in Monterrey, Mexico.
No.
Mike lost his job to a machine.
87 percent of lost manufacturing jobs
have been eliminated
because we've made improvements
in our own productivity
through automation.
So that means that one out of 10
lost manufacturing jobs
was due to offshoring.
Now, this is not just a US phenomenon.
No.
In fact, automation is spreading
to every production line
in every country around the world.
But look, I get it:
if you just lost your job
and then you read in the newspaper
that your old company
just struck up a deal with China,
it's easy to think you were just replaced
in a one-for-one deal.
When I hear stories like this,
I think that what people picture
is that trade happens
between only two countries.
Manufacturers in one country
produce products and they export them
to consumers in other countries,
and it feels like
the manufacturing countries win
and the importing countries lose.
Well, reality's a little bit different.
I'm a supply chain professional,
and I live and work in Mexico.
And I work in the middle
of a highly connected network
of manufacturers
all collaborating from around the world
to produce many
of the products we use today.
What I see
from my front-row seat in Mexico City
actually looks more like this.
And this is a more accurate depiction
of what trade really looks like.
I've had the pleasure of being able to see
how many different products
are manufactured,
from golf clubs to laptop computers
to internet servers, automobiles
and even airplanes.
And believe me, none of it
happens in a straight line.
Let me give you an example.
A few months ago, I was touring
the manufacturing plant
of a multinational aerospace company
in Querétaro, Mexico,
and the VP of logistics points out
a completed tail assembly.
It turns out the tail assemblies
are assembled from panels
that are manufactured in France,
and they're assembled in Mexico
using components imported from the US.
When those tail assemblies are done,
they're exported via truck to Canada
to their primary assembly plant
where they come together
with thousands of other parts,
like the wings and the seats
and the little shades
over the little windows,
all coming in to become
a part of a new airplane.
Think about it.
These new airplanes,
before they even take their first flight,
they have more stamps in their passports
than Angelina Jolie.
Now, this approach to processing
goes on all around the world
to manufacture many of the products
we use every day,
from skin cream to airplanes.
When you go home tonight,
take a look in your house.
You might be surprised to find
a label that looks like this one:
"Manufactured in the USA
from US and foreign parts."
Economist Michael Porter
described what's going on here best.
Many decades ago, he said
that it's most beneficial for a country
to focus on producing the products
it can produce most efficiently
and trading for the rest.
So what he's talking about here
is shared production,
and efficiency is the name of the game.
You've probably seen an example of this
at home or at work.
Let's take a look at an example.
Think about how your house was built
or your kitchen renovated.
Typically, there's a general contractor
who is responsible
for coordinating the efforts
of all the different contractors:
an architect to draw the plans,
an earth-moving company
to dig the foundation,
a plumber, a carpenter and so on.
So why doesn't the general contractor
pick just one company
to do all the work,
like, say, the architect?
Because this is silly.
The general contractor selects experts
because it takes years
to learn and master
how to do each of the tasks it takes
to build a house or renovate a kitchen,
some of them requiring special training.
Think about it:
Would you want your architect
to install your toilet?
Of course not.
So let's apply this process
to the corporate world.
Companies today focus on manufacturing
what they produce best
and most efficiently,
and they trade for everything else.
So this means they rely
on a global, interconnected,
interdependent network of manufacturers
to produce these products.
In fact, that network is so interconnected
it's almost impossible
to dismantle and produce
products in just one country.
Let's take a look
at the interconnected web
we saw a few moments ago,
and let's focus on just one strand
between the US and Mexico.
The Wilson Institute says
that shared production represents
40 percent of the half a trillion dollars
in trade between the US and Mexico.
That's about 200 billion dollars,
or the same as the GDP for Portugal.
So let's just imagine
that the US decides to impose
a 20 percent border tax
on all imports from Mexico.
OK, fine.
But do you think Mexico is just
going to stand by and let that happen?
No. No way.
So in retaliation,
they impose a similar tax
on all goods being imported from the US,
and a little game of tit-for-tat ensues,
and 20 percent -- just imagine
that 20 percent duties
are added to every good,
product, product component
crossing back and forth across the border,
and you could be looking at more
than a 40 percent increase in duties,
or 80 billion dollars.
Now, don't kid yourself,
these costs are going to be passed along
to you and to me.
Now, let's think about what impact
that might have on some of the products,
or the prices of the products,
that we buy every day.
So if a 30 percent increase in duties
were actually passed along,
we would be looking at some
pretty important increases in prices.
A Lincoln MKZ would go
from 37,000 dollars to 48,000.
And the price of a Sharp 60-inch HDTV
would go from 898 dollars
to 1,167 dollars.
And the price of a 16-ounce jar
of CVS skin moisturizer
would go from 13 dollars to 17 dollars.
Now, remember, this is only looking
at one strand of the production chain
between the US and Mexico,
so multiply this out
across all of the strands.
The impact could be considerable.
Now, just think about this:
even if we were able
to dismantle this network
and produce products in just one country,
which by the way is easier said than done,
we would still only
be saving or protecting
one out of 10 lost manufacturing jobs.
That's right, because remember,
most of those jobs, 87 percent,
were lost due to improvements
in our own productivity.
And unfortunately,
those jobs, they're gone for good.
So the real question is,
does it make sense for us
to drive up prices
to the point where many of us can't afford
the basic goods we use every day
for the purpose of saving a job
that might be eliminated
in a couple of years anyway?
The reality is that shared production
allows us to manufacture
higher quality products
at lower costs.
It's that simple.
It allows us to get more
out of the limited resources
and expertise we have
and at the same time
benefit from lower prices.
It's really important to remember
that for shared production
to be effective,
it relies on efficient cross-border
movement of raw materials,
components and finished products.
So remember this:
the next time you're hearing somebody
try to sell you on the idea
that protectionism is a good deal,
it's just not.
Thank you.
(Applause)
We humans are becoming an urban species,
so cities, they are our natural habitat.
That is where we live.
In 2014, over 54 percent
of the world population
was living in cities,
and I can bet you
that so many of these people have thought
of how they would do things differently,
like if I only had the tools
to change things in my city,
what would I do?
What would my dream city be like?
And these tools,
this is just what we gave them.
Two years ago, my team and I,
we released a game,
"Cities: Skylines."
It is a game about building cities.
So I have always been
interested in cities as systems.
It's something that I find
immensely interesting.
But what I didn't understand
was that I am not alone in this.
People love cities.
They are interested. They have ideas.
The game was an instant hit.
So far, over three and a half
million people have played it.
And it's not just about playing.
We also have really awesome
sharing systems.
So people play, they create cities
and then they are sharing these creations,
showing off what they have made.
And what I will show you
is some of these cities
created by the players.
So the game is about self-expression,
creativity,
not just overcoming the challenges
posed by the simulation.
It is about showing
what your cities look like.
So I have a couple of videos.
These are from YouTube.
And these are some of the most
interesting city designs I have seen.
So they are all different,
and I hope you like all of these.
This one is called The Netherlands.
It's by Silvarret.
And when you start the game,
you have an empty piece of land.
This land, it can be based
on the real world,
it can be hand-crafted in the map editor,
or you can, of course, download
a city made by someone else
and play in that.
But what Silvarret has done here
is that what he wanted to make
was not a real city.
This is a fantasy city,
even though it looks real.
So what he wanted to do was a fantasy city
that could be in the Netherlands.
So he kind of investigated
what are the characteristics
of cities in the Netherlands
and combined a couple of those,
and this is what he created.
So it is a city,
but it is not a real city,
but it could be.
It looks just like the Netherlands.
So the places are really
densely populated.
So what you need is highways, trains,
anything connecting
these small town centers together.
Lots of people, lots of moving,
so transportation is the key here.
But then let's go even more
on the fantasy side.
Let's go into the future.
This is one of my personal favorites.
These city designs
are what I love the most.
So this is a tiered city by Conflictnerd,
and the basic idea is
that you have concentric circle routes.
So the city is a big circle
with tinier circles inside.
And the thing is that you put
all of the services in the center,
and then people actually live
on the outer ring,
because there is less traffic,
less noise, less pollution,
so that is where you want to live.
But the services
are still really close by.
They are in the center.
And this is the soul of the game.
The player has to understand
what are the wishes, what are the needs
of the tiny people living in the cities.
So you need to know
where you should put the things.
Like, it's not enough to have a hospital.
It needs to be accessible.
Citizens need to reach the hospital.
And this is one way to do it.
So maybe this is something
that we might be seeing someday.
And then even more into the future.
Astergea by Yuttho.
So Yuttho does YouTube videos
and plays the game.
What he did here
was actually a 12-point series
of creating this city.
So what he does is he plays the game,
he records it
and he explains as he's going
what he's doing and why.
And as a part of this series,
he actually did an interview
with an actual urban planner
called Jeff Speck.
And Speck is an expert
on the concept of walkability.
The basic idea is that
if you want your citizens to walk,
which is kind of beneficial,
you actually need to have walking
as a reasonable means of transportation.
It should be a good way to reach places.
So what Yuttho did
was that he explained this concept,
he had Speck explain it, too,
and then he applied it
to the city that he was building.
So what we are seeing
is Yuttho's vision of the future:
lots of public transportation,
walkways, plazas,
connecting high-rise buildings.
Maybe this is what
the future might look like.
And the game system
works really well for this.
We are seeing some
real-world uses to this game.
So we know that some urban planners
are using it as a sketching tool,
so while the simulation
is not completely realistic,
it is realistic enough
that if something works in the game,
it is highly likely that it
will also work in the real world,
so that you can actually try out things,
see if this intersection
might fit this kind of a situation.
If we build a new road, would it help?
And this is what you can do
with this game.
There was one really
interesting contest held
by the Finnish city of Hämeenlinna.
So what they did
was that they had a new area
that they wanted to develop in the city.
They made a map with the existing city,
they left empty the area
that they would want to develop
and shared this map.
So anyone could download the map,
play the game, build the area
and submit their creations
to the city council.
So they have not yet built anything,
but it might just be
that they use one of these plans
made with the game
to actually build the real city.
And these videos that I have shown you,
these are the people who are
coming up with new kinds of solutions.
We know that cities are growing.
They're getting bigger as we go,
and the percentage of population
living in cities is projected to rise.
So we need the solutions
and these people, playing the game,
they are trying out
different kinds of solutions.
They might have something
that is really important.
So what we are seeing here is dream cities
that might be real one day.
So it might be
that this is not just a game.
It might be a way
to decide our own fate.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Now, if President Obama
invited me to be the next Czar of Mathematics,
then I would have a suggestion for him
that I think would vastly improve
the mathematics education in this country.
And it would be easy to implement
and inexpensive.
The mathematics curriculum that we have
is based on a foundation of arithmetic and algebra.
And everything we learn after that
is building up towards one subject.
And at top of that pyramid, it's calculus.
And I'm here to say
that I think that that is the wrong summit of the pyramid ...
that the correct summit -- that all of our students,
every high school graduate should know --
should be statistics:
probability and statistics.
(Applause)
I mean, don't get me wrong. Calculus is an important subject.
It's one of the great products of the human mind.
The laws of nature are written in the language of calculus.
And every student who studies math, science, engineering, economics,
they should definitely learn calculus
by the end of their freshman year of college.
But I'm here to say, as a professor of mathematics,
that very few people actually use calculus
in a conscious, meaningful way, in their day-to-day lives.
On the other hand,
statistics -- that's a subject that you could,
and should, use on daily basis. Right?
It's risk. It's reward. It's randomness.
It's understanding data.
I think if our students, if our high school students --
if all of the American citizens --
knew about probability and statistics,
we wouldn't be in the economic mess that we're in today. (Laughter) (Applause)
Not only -- thank you -- not only that ...
but if it's taught properly, it can be a lot of fun.
I mean, probability and statistics,
it's the mathematics of games and gambling.
It's analyzing trends. It's predicting the future.
Look, the world has changed
from analog to digital.
And it's time for our mathematics curriculum to change
from analog to digital,
from the more classical, continuous mathematics,
to the more modern, discrete mathematics --
the mathematics of uncertainty,
of randomness, of data --
that being probability and statistics.
In summary, instead of our students
learning about the techniques of calculus,
I think it would be far more significant
if all of them knew what two standard deviations
from the mean means. And I mean it.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
I was three months pregnant with twins
when my husband Ross and I
went to my second sonogram.
I was 35 years old at the time,
and I knew that that meant
we had a higher risk
of having a child with a birth defect.
So, Ross and I researched
the standard birth defects,
and we felt reasonably prepared.
Well, nothing would have prepared us
for the bizarre diagnosis
that we were about to face.
The doctor explained
that one of our twins, Thomas,
had a fatal birth defect
called anencephaly.
This means that his brain
was not formed correctly
because part of his skull was missing.
Babies with this diagnosis
typically die in utero
or within a few minutes, hours
or days of being born.
But the other twin, Callum,
appeared to be healthy,
as far as the doctor could tell,
and these twins were identical,
genetically identical.
So after a lot of questions about
how this could have possibly happened,
a selective reduction was mentioned,
and while this procedure
was not impossible,
it posed some unique risks
for the healthy twin and for me,
so we decided to carry
the pregnancy to term.
So there I was, three months pregnant,
with two trimesters ahead of me,
and I had to find a way to manage
my blood pressure and my stress.
And it felt like having a roommate
point a loaded gun at you for six months.
But I stared down
the barrel of that gun for so long
that I saw a light
at the end of the tunnel.
While there was nothing we could do
to prevent the tragedy,
I wanted to find a way
for Thomas's brief life
to have some kind of positive impact.
So I asked my nurse about organ,
eye and tissue donation.
She connected with our local
organ-procurement organization,
the Washington Regional
Transplant Community.
WRTC explained to me
that Thomas would probably be too small
at birth to donate for transplant,
and I was shocked:
I didn't even know
you could be rejected for that.
But they said that he would be
a good candidate to donate for research.
This helped me see Thomas in a new light.
As opposed to just a victim of a disease,
I started to see him as a possible key
to unlock a medical mystery.
On March 23, 2010,
the twins were born,
and they were both born alive.
And just like the doctor said,
Thomas was missing
the top part of his skull,
but he could nurse,
drink from a bottle,
cuddle and grab our fingers
like a normal baby,
and he slept in our arms.
After six days, Thomas died in Ross's arms
surrounded by our family.
We called WRTC, who sent a van to our home
and brought him to Children's
National Medical Center.
A few hours later, we got a call to say
that the recovery was a success,
and Thomas's donations
would be going to four different places.
His cord blood would go
to Duke University.
His liver would go to a cell-therapy
company called Cytonet in Durham.
His corneas would go
to Schepens Eye Research Institute,
which is part of Harvard Medical School,
and his retinas would go
to the University of Pennsylvania.
A few days later, we had a funeral
with our immediate family,
including baby Callum,
and we basically
closed this chapter in our lives.
But I did find myself wondering,
what's happening now?
What are the researchers learning?
And was it even worthwhile to donate?
WRTC invited Ross and I
to a grief retreat,
and we met about
15 other grieving families
who had donated their loved one's
organs for transplant.
Some of them had even received letters
from the people who received
their loved one's organs,
saying thank you.
I learned that they
could even meet each other
if they'd both sign a waiver,
almost like an open adoption.
And I was so excited,
I thought maybe I could write a letter
or I could get a letter
and learn about what happened.
But I was disappointed to learn
that this process only exists
for people who donate for transplant.
So I was jealous.
I had transplant envy, I guess.
(Laughter)
But over the years that followed,
I learned a lot more about donation,
and I even got a job in the field.
And I came up with an idea.
I wrote a letter that started out,
"Dear Researcher."
I explained who I was,
and I asked if they could tell me
why they requested infant retinas
in March of 2010,
and I asked if my family
could visit their lab.
I emailed it to the eye bank
that arranged the donation,
the Old Dominion Eye Foundation,
and asked if they could
send it to the right person.
They said that they had
never done this before,
and they couldn't guarantee a response,
but they wouldn't be an obstacle,
and they would deliver it.
Two days later, I got a response
from Dr. Arupa Ganguly
of the University of Pennsylvania.
She thanked me for the donation,
and she explained
that she is studying retinoblastoma,
which is a deadly cancer of the retina
that affects children
under the age of five,
and she said that yes,
we were invited to visit her lab.
So next we talked on the phone,
and one of the first things she said to me
was that she couldn't possibly
imagine how we felt,
and that Thomas had given
the ultimate sacrifice,
and that she seemed
to feel indebted to us.
So I said, "Nothing against your study,
but we didn't actually pick it.
We donated to the system,
and the system chose your study.
I said, "And second of all,
bad things happen to children every day,
and if you didn't want these retinas,
they would probably
be buried in the ground right now.
So to be able to participate in your study
gives Thomas's life
a new layer of meaning.
So, never feel guilty
about using this tissue."
Next, she explained to me how rare it was.
She had placed a request
for this tissue six years earlier
with the National Disease
Research Interchange.
She got only one sample of tissue
that fit her criteria,
and it was Thomas's.
Next, we arranged a date for me
to come visit the lab,
and we chose March 23, 2015,
which was the twins' fifth birthday.
After we hung up, I emailed her
some pictures of Thomas and Callum,
and a few weeks later,
we received this T-shirt in the mail.
A few months later, Ross, Callum
and I piled in the car
and we went for a road trip.
We met Arupa and her staff,
and Arupa said that when I told her
not to feel guilty, that it was a relief,
and that she hadn't seen it
from our perspective.
She also explained that Thomas
had a secret code name.
The same way Henrietta Lacks
is called HeLa,
Thomas was called RES 360.
RES means research,
and 360 means he was the 360th specimen
over the course of about 10 years.
She also shared with us a unique document,
and it was the shipping label
that sent his retinas
from DC to Philadelphia.
This shipping label
is like an heirloom to us now.
It's the same way that a military medal
or a wedding certificate might be.
Arupa also explained that she is using
Thomas's retina and his RNA
to try to inactivate the gene
that causes tumor formation,
and she even showed us some results
that were based on RES 360.
Then she took us to the freezer
and she showed us the two samples
that she still has
that are still labeled RES 360.
There's two little ones left.
She said she saved it
because she doesn't know
when she might get more.
After this, we went to the conference room
and we relaxed and we had lunch together,
and the lab staff presented Callum
with a birthday gift.
It was a child's lab kit.
And they also offered him an internship.
(Laughter)
So in closing, I have two
simple messages today.
One is that most of us probably
don't think about donating to research.
I know I didn't.
I think I'm a normal person.
But I did it.
It was a good experience,
and I recommend it,
and it brought my family a lot of peace.
And second is if you work
with human tissue
and you wonder about the donor
and about the family,
write them a letter.
Tell them you received it,
tell them what you're working on,
and invite them to visit your lab,
because that visit may be
even more gratifying for you
than it is for them.
And I'd also like to ask you a favor.
If you're ever successful
in arranging one of these visits,
please tell me about it.
The other part of my family's story
is that we ended up visiting
all four facilities
that received Thomas's donations.
And we met amazing people
doing inspiring work.
The way I see it now
is that Thomas got into Harvard,
Duke and Penn --
(Laughter)
And he has a job at Cytonet,
and he has colleagues and he has coworkers
who are in the top of their fields.
And they need him
in order to do their job.
And a life that once seemed
brief and insignificant
revealed itself to be vital,
everlasting and relevant.
And I only hope that my life
can be as relevant.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Cholera was reported in Haiti
for the first time in over 50 years
last October.
There was no way to predict
how far it would spread through water supplies
and how bad the situation would get.
And not knowing where help was needed
always ensured that help was in short supply
in the areas that needed it most.
We've gotten good at predicting and preparing for storms
before they take innocent lives
and cause irreversible damage,
but we still can't do that with water,
and here's why.
Right now, if you want to test water in the field,
you need a trained technician,
expensive equipment like this,
and you have to wait about a day
for chemical reactions to take place and provide results.
It's too slow
to get a picture of conditions on the ground
before they change,
too expensive to implement
in all the places that require testing.
And it ignores the fact that, in the meanwhile,
people still need to drink water.
Most of the information that we collected on the cholera outbreak
didn't come from testing water;
it came from forms like this,
which documented all the people
we failed to help.
Countless lives have been saved
by canaries in coalmines --
a simple and invaluable way
for miners to know whether they're safe.
I've been inspired by that simplicity as I've been working on this problem
with some of the most hardworking and brilliant people I've ever known.
We think there's a simpler solution to this problem --
one that can be used
by people who face conditions like this everyday.
It's in its early stages,
but this is what it looks like right now.
We call it the Water Canary.
It's a fast, cheap device
that answers an important question:
Is this water contaminated?
It doesn't require any special training.
And instead of waiting for chemical reactions to take place,
it uses light.
That means there's no waiting
for chemical reactions to take place,
no need to use reagents that can run out
and no need to be an expert
to get actionable information.
To test water, you simply insert a sample
and, within seconds,
it either displays a red light, indicating contaminated water,
or a green light, indicating the sample is safe.
This will make it possible
for anyone to collect life-saving information
and to monitor water quality conditions as they unfold.
We're also, on top of that,
integrating wireless networking
into an affordable device
with GPS and GSM.
What that means is that each reading can be automatically transmitted to servers
to be mapped in real time.
With enough users,
maps like this will make it possible
to take preventive action,
containing hazards before they turn into emergencies
that take years to recover from.
And then, instead of taking days
to disseminate this information to the people who need it most,
it can happen automatically.
We've seen how distributed networks,
big data and information
can transform society.
I think it's time for us to apply them to water.
Our goal over the next year is to get Water Canary ready for the field
and to open-source the hardware
so that anyone can contribute to the development and the evaluation,
so we can tackle this problem together.
Thank you.
(Applause)
At Free America, we've done
a listening and learning tour.
We visited not only with prosecutors
but with legislators,
with inmates in our state
and local prisons.
We've gone to immigration
detention centers.
We've met a lot of people.
And we've seen that redemption
and transformation can happen
in our prisons, our jails
and our immigration detention centers,
giving hope to those
who want to create a better life
after serving their time.
Imagine if we also considered
the front end of this prison pipeline.
What would it look like
if we intervened,
with rehabilitation as a core value --
with love and compassion as core values?
We would have a society that is safer,
healthier
and worthy of raising our children in.
I want to introduce you to James Cavitt.
James served 12 years
in the San Quentin State Prison
and is being released in 18 months.
Now James, like you and me,
is more than the worst thing he's done.
He is a father, a husband, a son, a poet.
He committed a crime;
he's paying his debt,
and working hard to build the skills
to make the transition back
to a productive life
when he enters the civilian
population again.
Now James, like millions
of people behind bars,
is an example of what happens
if we believe that our failings
don't define who we are,
that we are all worthy of redemption
and if we support those impacted
by mass incarceration,
we can all heal together.
I'd like to introduce you
to James right now,
and he's going to share
his journey of redemption
through spoken word.
James Cavitt: Thanks, John.
TED, welcome to San Quentin.
The talent is abundant
behind prison walls.
Future software engineers,
entrepreneurs,
craftsmen,
musicians
and artists.
This piece is inspired
by all of the hard work
that men and women are doing on the inside
to create better lives
and futures for themselves
after they serve their time.
This piece is entitled, "Where I Live."
I live in a world where most people
are too afraid to go.
Surrounded by tall, concrete walls,
steel bars,
where razor wire have a way
of cutting away at the hopes
for a brighter tomorrow.
I live in a world
that kill people who kill people
in order to teach people
that killing people is wrong.
Imagine that.
Better yet,
imagine a world where healed people
helped hurt people heal
and become strong.
Maybe then we would all
be singin' "Redemption Song."
I live in a world that
has been called "hell on Earth"
by those trapped inside.
But I've come to the stark realization
that prison --
it really is what you make it.
You see, in spite
of the harshness of my reality,
there is a silver lining.
I knew that my freedom was gonna come,
it was just a matter of time.
And so I treated my first steps
as if they were my last mile,
and I realized that you
don't have to be free
in order to experience freedom.
And just because you're free,
doesn't mean that you have freedom.
Many of us, for years,
have been battling our inner demons.
We walk around smiling
when inside we're really screamin':
freedom!
Don't you get it?
We're all serving time;
we're just in different places.
As for me,
I choose to be free
from the prisons I've created.
The key:
forgiveness.
Action's my witness.
If we want freedom,
then we gotta think different.
Because freedom ...
it isn't a place.
It's a mind setting.
Thank you.
(Applause)

John Legend: Old pirates, yes, they rob I.
Sold I to the merchant ships.
Minutes after they took I

My hands were made strong
by the hand of the almighty.
We forward in this generation

Won't you help to sing
these songs of freedom?
'Cause all I ever had --
redemption songs.
Redemption songs.
Emancipate yourselves from mental slavery.
None but ourselves can free our minds.
Have no fear for atomic energy
'cause none of them can stop the time.
How long shall they kill our prophets
while we stand aside and look?
Some say it's just a part of it,
we've got to fulfill the book.
Won't you help to sing

(Sikh Prayer) Waheguru Ji Ka Khalsa,
Waheguru Ji Ki Fateh.
There is a moment on the birthing table
that feels like dying.
The body in labor stretches
to form an impossible circle.
The contractions
are less than a minute apart.
Wave after wave,
there is barely time to breathe.
The medical term:
"transition,"
because "feels like dying"
is not scientific enough.
(Laughter)
I checked.
During my transition,
my husband was pressing down on my sacrum
to keep my body from breaking.
My father was waiting
behind the hospital curtain ...
more like hiding.
But my mother was at my side.
The midwife said
she could see the baby's head,
but all I could feel was a ring of fire.
I turned to my mother and said, "I can't,"
but she was already pouring
my grandfather's prayer in my ear.
(Sikh Prayer) "Tati Vao Na Lagi,
Par Brahm Sarnai."
"The hot winds cannot touch you."
"You are brave," she said.
"You are brave."
And suddenly I saw my grandmother
standing behind my mother.
And her mother behind her.
And her mother behind her.
A long line of women who had
pushed through the fire before me.
I took a breath;
I pushed;
my son was born.
As I held him in my arms,
shaking and sobbing
from the rush of oxytocin
that flooded my body,
my mother was already
preparing to feed me.
Nursing her baby as I nursed mine.
My mother had never stopped
laboring for me,
from my birth to my son's birth.
She already knew
what I was just beginning to name.
That love is more than a rush of feeling
that happens to us if we're lucky.
Love is sweet labor.
Fierce.
Bloody.
Imperfect.
Life-giving.
A choice we make over and over again.
I am an American civil rights activist
who has labored with communities
of color since September 11,
fighting unjust policies by the state
and acts of hate in the street.
And in our most painful moments,
in the face of the fires of injustice,
I have seen labors of love deliver us.
My life on the frontlines of fighting
hate in America has been a study
in what I've come to call
revolutionary love.
Revolutionary love
is the choice to enter into labor
for others who do not look like us,
for our opponents who hurt us
and for ourselves.
In this era of enormous rage,
when the fires are burning all around us,
I believe that revolutionary love
is the call of our times.
Now, if you cringe when people say,
"Love is the answer ..."
I do, too.
(Laughter)
I am a lawyer.
(Laughter)
So let me show you how I came to see love
as a force for social justice
through three lessons.
My first encounter with hate
was in the schoolyard.
I was a little girl
growing up in California,
where my family has lived
and farmed for a century.
When I was told that I would go to hell
because I was not Christian,
called a "black dog"
because I was not white,
I ran to my grandfather's arms.
Papa Ji dried my tears --
gave me the words of Guru Nanak,
the founder of the Sikh faith.
"I see no stranger," said Nanak.
"I see no enemy."
My grandfather taught me
that I could choose
to see all the faces I meet
and wonder about them.
And if I wonder about them,
then I will listen to their stories
even when it's hard.
I will refuse to hate them
even when they hate me.
I will even vow to protect them
when they are in harm's way.
That's what it means to be a Sikh:
S-i-k-h.
To walk the path of a warrior saint.
He told me the story
of the first Sikh woman warrior,
Mai Bhago.
The story goes there were 40 soldiers
who abandoned their post
during a great battle against an empire.
They returned to a village,
and this village woman
turned to them and said,
"You will not abandon the fight.
You will return to the fire,
and I will lead you."
She mounted a horse.
She donned a turban.
And with sword in her hand
and fire in her eyes,
she led them where no one else would.
She became the one she was waiting for.
"Don't abandon your posts, my dear."
My grandfather saw me as a warrior.
I was a little girl in two long braids,
but I promised.
Fast-forward, I'm 20 years old,
watching the Twin Towers fall,
the horror stuck in my throat,
and then a face flashes on the screen:
a brown man with a turban and beard,
and I realize that our nation's new enemy
looks like my grandfather.
And these turbans meant to represent
our commitment to serve
cast us as terrorists.
And Sikhs became targets of hate,
alongside our Muslim brothers and sisters.
The first person killed in a hate crime
after September 11 was a Sikh man,
standing in front
of his gas station in Arizona.
Balbir Singh Sodhi
was a family friend I called "uncle,"
murdered by a man
who called himself "patriot."
He is the first of many
to have been killed,
but his story --
our stories barely made the evening news.
I didn't know what to do,
but I had a camera,
I faced the fire.
I went to his widow,
Joginder Kaur.
I wept with her, and I asked her,
"What would you like to tell
the people of America?"
I was expecting blame.
But she looked at me and said,
"Tell them, 'Thank you.'
3,000 Americans came
to my husband's memorial.
They did not know me,
but they wept with me.
Tell them, 'Thank you.'"
Thousands of people showed up,
because unlike national news,
the local media told Balbir Uncle's story.
Stories can create the wonder
that turns strangers
into sisters and brothers.
This was my first lesson
in revolutionary love --
that stories can help us see no stranger.
And so ...
my camera became my sword.
My law degree became my shield.
My film partner became my husband.
(Laughter)
I didn't expect that.
And we became part
of a generation of advocates
working with communities
facing their own fires.
I worked inside of supermax prisons,
on the shores of Guantanamo,
at the sites of mass shootings
when the blood
was still fresh on the ground.
And every time,
for 15 years,
with every film, with every lawsuit,
with every campaign,
I thought we were making the nation safer
for the next generation.
And then my son was born.
In a time ...
when hate crimes against our communities
are at the highest
they have been since 9/11.
When right-wing nationalist movements
are on the rise around the globe
and have captured
the presidency of the United States.
When white supremacists
march in our streets,
torches high, hoods off.
And I have to reckon with the fact
that my son is growing up
in a country more dangerous for him
than the one I was given.
And there will be moments
when I cannot protect him
when he is seen as a terrorist ...
just as black people in America
are still seen as criminal.
Brown people, illegal.
Queer and trans people, immoral.
Indigenous people, savage.
Women and girls as property.
And when they fail to see our bodies
as some mother's child,
it becomes easier to ban us,
detain us,
deport us,
imprison us,
sacrifice us for the illusion of security.
(Applause)
I wanted to abandon my post.
But I made a promise,
so I returned to the gas station
where Balbir Singh Sodhi was killed
15 years to the day.
I set down a candle
in the spot where he bled to death.
His brother, Rana, turned to me
and said, "Nothing has changed."
And I asked,
"Who have we not yet tried to love?"
We decided to call the murderer in prison.
The phone rings.
My heart is beating in my ears.
I hear the voice of Frank Roque,
a man who once said ...
"I'm going to go out
and shoot some towel heads.
We should kill their children, too."
And every emotional impulse
in me says, "I can't."
It becomes an act of will to wonder.
"Why?" I ask.
"Why did you agree to speak with us?"
Frank says, "I'm sorry for what happened,
but I'm also sorry
for all the people killed on 9/11."
He fails to take responsibility.
I become angry to protect Rana,
but Rana is still wondering about Frank --
listening --
responds.
"Frank, this is the first time
I'm hearing you say
that you feel sorry."
And Frank --
Frank says, "Yes.
I am sorry for what I did to your brother.
One day when I go to heaven
to be judged by God,
I will ask to see your brother.
And I will hug him.
And I will ask him for forgiveness."
And Rana says ...
"We already forgave you."
Forgiveness is not forgetting.
Forgiveness is freedom from hate.
Because when we are free from hate,
we see the ones who hurt us
not as monsters,
but as people who themselves are wounded,
who themselves feel threatened,
who don't know what else
to do with their insecurity
but to hurt us, to pull the trigger,
or cast the vote,
or pass the policy aimed at us.
But if some of us
begin to wonder about them,
listen even to their stories,
we learn that participation
in oppression comes at a cost.
It cuts them off
from their own capacity to love.
This was my second lesson
in revolutionary love.
We love our opponents
when we tend the wound in them.
Tending to the wound
is not healing them --
only they can do that.
Just tending to it allows us
to see our opponents:
the terrorist, the fanatic, the demagogue.
They've been radicalized by cultures
and policies that we together can change.
I looked back on all of our campaigns,
and I realized that any time
we fought bad actors,
we didn't change very much.
But when we chose
to wield our swords and shields
to battle bad systems,
that's when we saw change.
I have worked on campaigns
that released hundreds of people
out of solitary confinement,
reformed a corrupt police department,
changed federal hate crimes policy.
The choice to love our opponents
is moral and pragmatic,
and it opens up the previously
unimaginable possibility
of reconciliation.
But remember ...
it took 15 years to make that phone call.
I had to tend to my own rage
and grief first.
Loving our opponents
requires us to love ourselves.
Gandhi, King, Mandela --
they taught a lot about
how to love others and opponents.
They didn't talk a lot
about loving ourselves.
This is a feminist intervention.
(Applause)
Yes.
Yes.
(Applause)
Because for too long have women
and women of color been told
to suppress their rage,
suppress their grief
in the name of love and forgiveness.
But when we suppress our rage,
that's when it hardens
into hate directed outward,
but usually directed inward.
But mothering has taught me
that all of our emotions are necessary.
Joy is the gift of love.
Grief is the price of love.
Anger is the force that protects it.
This was my third lesson
in revolutionary love.
We love ourselves
when we breathe through the fire of pain
and refuse to let it harden into hate.
That's why I believe
that love must be practiced
in all three directions
to be revolutionary.
Loving just ourselves feels good,
but it's narcissism.
(Laughter)
Loving only our opponents
is self-loathing.
Loving only others is ineffective.
This is where a lot
of our movements live right now.
We need to practice
all three forms of love.
And so, how do we practice it?
Ready?
Number one ...
in order to love others,
see no stranger.
We can train our eyes
to look upon strangers on the street,
on the subway, on the screen,
and say in our minds,
"Brother,
sister,
aunt,
uncle."
And when we say this,
what we are saying is,
"You are a part of me I do not yet know.
I choose to wonder about you.
I will listen for your stories
and pick up a sword
when you are in harm's way."
And so, number two:
in order to love our opponents,
tend the wound.
Can you see the wound
in the ones who hurt you?
Can you wonder even about them?
And if this question
sends panic through your body,
then your most revolutionary act
is to wonder, listen and respond
to your own needs.
Number three:
in order to love ourselves,
breathe and push.
When we are pushing
into the fires in our bodies
or the fires in the world,
we need to be breathing together
in order to be pushing together.
How are you breathing each day?
Who are you breathing with?
Because ...
when executive orders
and news of violence hits our bodies hard,
sometimes less than a minute apart,
it feels like dying.
In those moments,
my son places his hand
on my cheek and says,
"Dance time, mommy?"
And we dance.
In the darkness, we breathe and we dance.
Our family becomes
a pocket of revolutionary love.
Our joy is an act of moral resistance.
How are you protecting your joy each day?
Because in joy we see
even darkness with new eyes.
And so the mother in me asks,
what if this darkness
is not the darkness of the tomb,
but the darkness of the womb?
What if our future is not dead,
but still waiting to be born?
What if this is our great transition?
Remember the wisdom of the midwife.
"Breathe," she says.
And then --
"push."
Because if we don't push, we will die.
If we don't breathe, we will die.
Revolutionary love requires us
to breathe and push through the fire
with a warrior's heart and a saint's eyes
so that one day ...
one day you will see my son as your own
and protect him when I am not there.
You will tend to the wound
in the ones who want to hurt him.
You will teach him how to love himself
because you love yourself.
You will whisper in his ear,
as I whisper in yours,
"You are brave."
You are brave.
Thank you.

What do we know about the future?
Difficult question,
simple answer: nothing.
We cannot predict the future.
We only can create a vision
of the future, how it might be,
a vision which reveals disruptive
ideas, which is inspiring,
and this is the most important reason
which breaks the chains
of common thinking.
There are a lot of people
who created their own vision
about the future,
for instance, this vision here
from the early 20th century.
It says here that this
is the ocean plane of the future.
It takes only one and a half days
to cross the Atlantic Ocean.
Today, we know that this future
vision didn't come true.
So this is our largest
airplane which we have,
the Airbus A380, and it's quite huge,
so a lot of people fit in there
and it's technically completely different
than the vision I've shown to you.
I'm working in a team with Airbus,
and we have created our vision
about a more sustainable
future of aviation.
So sustainability is quite
important for us,
which should incorporate social
but as well as environmental
and economic values.
So we have created a very
disruptive structure
which mimics the design
of bone, or a skeleton,
which occurs in nature.
So that's why it looks
maybe a little bit weird,
especially to the people who deal
with structures in general.
But at least it's just a kind of artwork
to explore our ideas
about a different future.
What are the main customers of the future?
So, we have the old, we have the young,
we have the uprising power of women,
and there's one mega-trend
which affects all of us.
These are the future anthropometrics.
So our children are getting
larger, but at the same time
we are growing into different directions.
So what we need is space
inside the aircraft,
inside a very dense area.
These people have different needs.
So we see a clear need
of active health promotion,
especially in the case of the old people.
We want to be treated as individuals.
We like to be productive
throughout the entire travel chain,
and what we are doing in the future is
we want to use the latest
man-machine interface,
and we want to integrate this
and show this in one product.
So we combined these needs
with technology's themes.
So for instance, we are asking ourselves,
how can we create more light?
How can we bring more natural
light into the airplane?
So this airplane has no
windows anymore, for example.
What about the data
and communication software
which we need in the future?
My belief is that the airplane
of the future
will get its own consciousness.
It will be more like a living organism
than just a collection
of very complex technology.
This will be very different in the future.
It will communicate directly
with the passenger in its environment.
And then we are talking
also about materials,
synthetic biology, for example.
And my belief is that we will get
more and more
new materials which we can
put into structure later on,
because structure is one of the key
issues in aircraft design.
So let's compare the old
world with the new world.
I just want to show you here
what we are doing today.
So this is a bracket of an A380
crew rest compartment.
It takes a lot of weight,
and it follows the classical design rules.
This here is an equal bracket
for the same purpose.
It follows the design of bone.
The design process
is completely different.
At the one hand, we have 1.2 kilos,
and at the other hand 0.6 kilos.
So this technology, 3D
printing, and new design rules
really help us to reduce the weight,
which is the biggest issue
in aircraft design,
because it's directly linked
to greenhouse gas emissions.
Push this idea a little bit forward.
So how does nature build its
components and structures?
So nature is very clever.
It puts all the information
into these small building
blocks, which we call DNA.
And nature builds large
skeletons out of it.
So we see a bottom-up approach here,
because all the information,
as I said, are inside the DNA.
And this is combined
with a top-down approach,
because what we are doing
in our daily life
is we train our muscles,
we train our skeleton,
and it's getting stronger.
And the same approach can be
applied to technology as well.
So our building block is carbon
nanotubes, for example,
to create a large, rivet-less
skeleton at the end of the day.
How this looks in particular,
you can show it here.
So imagine you have
carbon nanotubes growing
inside a 3D printer,
and they are embedded
inside a matrix of plastic,
and follow the forces
which occur in your component.
And you've got trillions of them.
So you really align them to wood,
and you take this wood and make
morphological optimization,
so you make structures, sub-structures,
which allows you to transmit
electrical energy or data.
And now we take this
material, combine this
with a top-down approach,
and build bigger and bigger components.
So how might the airplane
of the future look?
So we have very different
seats which adapt
to the shape of the future passenger,
with the different anthropometrics.
We have social areas inside the aircraft
which might turn into a place
where you can play virtual golf.
And finally, this bionic structure,
which is covered by a transparent
biopolymer membrane,
will really change radically
how we look at aircrafts in the future.
So as Jason Silva said,
if we can imagine it, why not make it so?
See you in the future. Thank you.

The digital divide is a mother
that's 45 years old and can't get a job,
because she doesn't know
how to use a computer.
It is an immigrant that doesn't know
that he can call his family for free.
It is a child who can't
resolve his homework,
because he doesn't have
access to information.
The digital divide is a new illiteracy.
"Digital divide" is also defined as:
the gap between individuals
and communities
that have access
to information technologies
and those that don't.
Why does this happen?
It happens because of 3 things.
The first is that people can't get
access to these technologies
because they can't afford them.
The second is because
they don't know how to use them.
The third is because they don't know
the benefits derived from technology.
So let's consider
some very basic statistics.
The population of the world
is nearly seven billion people.
Out of these, approximately two billion
are digitally included.
This is approximately 30%
of the entire world population,
which means that the remaining
70% of the world --
close to five billion people --
do not have access
to a computer or the internet.
Let's think about
that number for a second.
Five billion people; that's four
times the population of India,
that have never touched a computer,
have never accessed the internet.
So this is a digital abyss
that we're talking about,
this is not a digital divide.
Here we can see a map by Chris Harrison
that shows the internet connections
around the world.
What we can see is that most
of the internet connections
are centered on North America and Europe,
while the rest of the world is engulfed
in the dark shadow of digital divide.
Next, we can see connections,
city-to-city, around the world,
and we can see that most
of the information generated
is being generated
between North America and Europe,
while the rest of the world is not
broadcasting their ideas or information.
So what does this mean?
We are living in a world that seems
to be having a digital revolution,
a revolution that everyone here
thinks that we're part of,
but the 70% of the world that is
digitally excluded is not part of this.
What does this mean?
Well, the people that will be digitally
excluded won't be able to compete
in the labor markets of the future,
they won't be connected,
they'll be less informed,
they'll be less inspired
and they'll be less responsible.
Internet should not be a luxury,
it should be a right,
because it is a basic social necessity
of the 21st century.
We can't operate without it.
(Applause)
Thank you.
It allows us to connect to the world.
It empowers us.
It gives us social participation.
It is a tool for change.
And so, how are we going
to bridge this digital divide?
Well, there are many models
that try and bridge the digital divide,
that try and include
the population at large.
But the question is:
Are they really working?
I'm sure everybody here
knows One Laptop per Child,
where one computer is given to one child.
The problem with this is,
do we really want children
to take computers to their homes,
homes that have adverse conditions?
And we also must understand
that by giving a child a computer,
we're also transferring costs,
very high costs,
such as internet connection, electricity,
maintenance, software, updates.
So we must create different models,
models that help the families
rather than add a burden on them.
Also, let's not forget
about the carbon footprint.
Imagine five billion laptops.
What would the world look like then?
Imagine the hazardous residue
that would be generated from that.
Imagine the trash.
So if we give one computer to one person,
and we multiply that times five billion,
even if that laptop is a hundred dollars,
then we would have 483 trillion dollars.
Now let's consider we're only counting
the youth, ages 10 to 24.
That's approximately 30%
of the digitally excluded population.
Then that would be 145 trillion dollars.
What nation has this amount of money?
This is not a sustainable model.
So with this in mind,
we created a different model.
We created the RIA, in Spanish,
or in English, Learning
and Innovation Network,
which is a network of community centers
that bring education
through the use of technology.
We wanted to increase the number
of users per computer in such a way
that we could dilute the cost
of infrastructure, the cost per user,
and that we could bring
education and technology
to everybody within these communities.
Let's look at a basic comparison.
The RIA has 1,650 computers.
If we had used
the One Laptop per Child model
of a 1 to 1 ratio,
then we would have benefited 1,650 users.
What we did instead is set up centers
that have longer hours
of operation than schools,
that also include all of the population --
our youngest user is 3 years old,
the oldest is 86 --
and with this, in less than two years,
we were able to reach 140,000 users,
out of which --
(Applause)
Thank you.
out of which, 34,000 have already
graduated from our courses.
Another thing with One Laptop per Child
is that it doesn't guarantee
the educational use of a computer.
Technology is nothing
without that content.
We need to use it
as a means, not as an end.
How did we accomplish such a high impact?
Well, you can't just go into a community
and pretend to change it,
you need to look at a lot of factors.
So what we do is a thing
we call "urban acupuncture."
We first start by looking
at the basic geography of a site.
So take, for example, Ecatepec.
This is one of the most densely
populated municipalities in Mexico.
It has a very low income level.
So we look at the basic geography,
we look at roads, streets,
the flux of pedestrians and vehicles.
Then we look at income,
we look at education.
Then we set up a center there
in the place that's going
to heal the body,
a little needle to change the city body.
And there we go.
And so, there are four basic elements
that we need to consider
when we're using education
through technology.
The first one is we need to create spaces.
We need to create a space
that is welcoming to the community,
a space that is according to the needs
of the children and of the elders
and of every possible person
that lives within that community.
So we create these spaces
that are all made with recycled materials.
We use modular architecture
to lower the ecological impact.
And second, connection.
By connection, I mean not only
a connection to the internet,
that's too easy.
We need to create a connection
that's an interconnection of humans.
The internet is a very complex organism
that is fueled of the ideas, the thoughts
and the emotions of human beings.
We need to create networks
that aid in exchanging information.
Third, content.
Education is nothing without content.
And you can't pretend
to have a relationship
of only a computer with a child.
So we create a route,
a very basic learning route,
where we teach people
how to use a computer,
how to use the internet,
how to use office software,
and in 72 hours,
we create digital citizens.
You can't pretend that people
are just going to touch a computer
and become digitally included,
you need to have a process.
And after this, then they can take on
a longer educational route.
And then fourth, training.
We need to train not only the users,
but we need to train the people
that will facilitate learning
for these people.
When you're talking about
the digital divide,
people have stigmas, people have fears;
people don't understand how
it can complement their lives.
So what we do is train facilitators
so that they can help
in breaking that digital barrier.
So, we have four elements:
we have a space that's created,
we have a connection,
we have content and we have training.
We have created
a digital learning community.
But there is one more element,
which is the benefits
that technology can create,
because it is not printed, static content.
It is dynamic; it is modifiable.
So we have we do is, we provide
content, then we do training,
then we analyze the user patterns
so that we can improve content.
So it creates a virtuous circle.
It allows us to deliver education
according to different
types of intelligence
and according to different user needs.
With this in mind,
we have to think that technology
is something that can modify
according to human processes.
I want to share a story.
In 2006, I went to live here.
This is one of the poorest
communities in all of Mexico.
I went to film a documentary
on the people that live off trash,
entirely of trash -- their houses
are built with trash,
they eat trash, they dress in trash.
And after two months of living with them,
of seeing the children
and the way they work,
I understood that the only thing
that can change
and that can break the poverty
cycle is education.
And we can use technology
to bring education to these communities.
Here is another shot.
The main message is that technology
is not going to save the world;
we are, and we can use
technology to help us.
I'm sure everybody here
has experienced it;
what moves technology is human energy.
So let's use this energy
to make the world a better place.
Thank you.
(Applause)
What happens when technology
knows more about us than we do?
A computer now can detect
our slightest facial microexpressions
and be able to tell the difference
between a real smile and a fake one.
That's only the beginning.
Technology has become
incredibly intelligent
and already knows a lot
about our internal states.
And whether we like it or not,
we already are sharing
parts of our inner lives
that's out of our control.
That seems like a problem,
because a lot of us like to keep
what's going on inside
from what people actually see.
We want to have agency
over what we share and what we don't.
We all like to have a poker face.
But I'm here to tell you
that I think that's a thing of the past.
And while that might sound scary,
it's not necessarily a bad thing.
I've spent a lot of time
studying the circuits in the brain
that create the unique perceptual
realities that we each have.
And now I bring that together
with the capabilities
of current technology
to create new technology
that does make us better,
feel more, connect more.
And I believe to do that,
we have to be OK
losing some of our agency.
With some animals, it's really amazing,
and we get to see into
their internal experiences.
We get this upfront look
at the mechanistic interaction
between how they respond
to the world around them
and the state of their biological systems.
This is where evolutionary pressures
like eating, mating
and making sure we don't get eaten
drive deterministic behavioral responses
to information in the world.
And we get to see into this window,
into their internal states
and their biological experiences.
It's really pretty cool.
Now, stay with me for a moment --
I'm a violinist, not a singer.
But the spider's already
given me a critical review.
(Video) (Singing in a low pitch)
(Singing in a middle pitch)
(Singing in a high pitch)
(Singing in a low pitch)
(Singing in a middle pitch)
(Singing in a high pitch)
(Laughter)
Poppy Crum: It turns out, some spiders
tune their webs like violins
to resonate with certain sounds.
And likely, the harmonics
of my voice as it went higher
coupled with how loud I was singing
recreated either the predatory call
of an echolocating bat or a bird,
and the spider did what it should.
It predictively told me to bug off.
I love this.
The spider's responding
to its external world
in a way that we get to see and know
what's happening to its internal world.
Biology is controlling
the spider's response;
it's wearing its internal
state on its sleeve.
But us, humans --
we're different.
We like to think we have cognitive control
over what people see, know and understand
about our internal states --
our emotions, our insecurities,
our bluffs, our trials and tribulations --
and how we respond.
We get to have our poker face.
Or maybe we don't.
Try this with me.
Your eye responds
to how hard your brain is working.
The response you're about to see
is driven entirely by mental effort
and has nothing to do
with changes in lighting.
We know this from neuroscience.
I promise, your eyes are doing
the same thing as the subject in our lab,
whether you want them to or not.
At first, you'll hear some voices.
Try and understand them
and keep watching the eye in front of you.
It's going to be hard at first,
one should drop out,
and it should get really easy.
You're going to see the change in effort
in the diameter of the pupil.
(Video) (Two overlapping voices talking)
(Single voice) Intelligent technology
depends on personal data.
(Two overlapping voices talking)
(Single voice) Intelligent technology
depends on personal data.
PC: Your pupil doesn't lie.
Your eye gives away your poker face.
When your brain's having to work harder,
your autonomic nervous system
drives your pupil to dilate.
When it's not, it contracts.
When I take away one of the voices,
the cognitive effort
to understand the talkers
gets a lot easier.
I could have put the two voices
in different spatial locations,
I could have made one louder.
You would have seen the same thing.
We might think we have more agency
over the reveal of our internal state
than that spider,
but maybe we don't.
Today's technology is starting
to make it really easy
to see the signals and tells
that give us away.
The amalgamation of sensors
paired with machine learning
on us, around us and in our environments,
is a lot more than cameras and microphones
tracking our external actions.
Our bodies radiate our stories
from changes in the temperature
of our physiology.
We can look at these
as infrared thermal images
showing up behind me,
where reds are hotter
and blues are cooler.
The dynamic signature
of our thermal response
gives away our changes in stress,
how hard our brain is working,
whether we're paying attention
and engaged in the conversation
we might be having
and even whether we're experiencing
a picture of fire as if it were real.
We can actually see
people give off heat on their cheeks
in response to an image of flame.
But aside from giving away
our poker bluffs,
what if dimensions of data
from someone's thermal response
gave away a glow
of interpersonal interest?
Tracking the honesty of feelings
in someone's thermal image
might be a new part of how
we fall in love and see attraction.
Our technology can listen,
develop insights and make predictions
about our mental and physical health
just by analyzing the timing dynamics
of our speech and language
picked up by microphones.
Groups have shown that changes
in the statistics of our language
paired with machine learning
can predict the likelihood
someone will develop psychosis.
I'm going to take it a step further
and look at linguistic changes
and changes in our voice
that show up with a lot
of different conditions.
Dementia, diabetes can alter
the spectral coloration of our voice.
Changes in our language
associated with Alzheimer's
can sometimes show up more
than 10 years before clinical diagnosis.
What we say and how we say it
tells a much richer story
than we used to think.
And devices we already have in our homes
could, if we let them,
give us invaluable insight back.
The chemical composition of our breath
gives away our feelings.
There's a dynamic mixture of acetone,
isoprene and carbon dioxide
that changes when our heart speeds up,
when our muscles tense,
and all without any obvious change
in our behaviors.
Alright, I want you to watch
this clip with me.
Some things might be going on
on the side screens,
but try and focus on
the image in the front
and the man at the window.
(Eerie music)
(Woman screams)
PC: Sorry about that.
I needed to get a reaction.
(Laughter)
I'm actually tracking the carbon dioxide
you exhale in the room right now.
We've installed tubes
throughout the theater,
lower to the ground,
because CO2 is heavier than air.
But they're connected
to a device in the back
that lets us measure, in real time,
with high precision,
the continuous differential
concentration of CO2.
The clouds on the sides are actually
the real-time data visualization
of the density of our CO2.
You might still see
a patch of red on the screen,
because we're showing increases
with larger colored clouds,
larger colored areas of red.
And that's the point
where a lot of us jumped.
It's our collective suspense
driving a change in carbon dioxide.
Alright, now, watch this
with me one more time.
(Cheerful music)
(Woman laughs)
PC: You knew it was coming.
But it's a lot different
when we changed the creator's intent.
Changing the music and the sound effects
completely alter the emotional
impact of that scene.
And we can see it in our breath.
Suspense, fear, joy
all show up as reproducible,
visually identifiable moments.
We broadcast a chemical signature
of our emotions.
It is the end of the poker face.
Our spaces, our technology
will know what we're feeling.
We will know more about each other
than we ever have.
We get a chance to reach in and connect
to the experience and sentiments
that are fundamental to us as humans
in our senses, emotionally and socially.
I believe it is the era of the empath.
And we are enabling the capabilities
that true technological partners can bring
to how we connect with each other
and with our technology.
If we recognize the power
of becoming technological empaths,
we get this opportunity
where technology can help us bridge
the emotional and cognitive divide.
And in that way, we get to change
how we tell our stories.
We can enable a better future
for technologies like augmented reality
to extend our own agency
and connect us at a much deeper level.
Imagine a high school counselor
being able to realize
that an outwardly cheery student
really was having a deeply hard time,
where reaching out can make
a crucial, positive difference.
Or authorities, being able
to know the difference
between someone having
a mental health crisis
and a different type of aggression,
and responding accordingly.
Or an artist, knowing
the direct impact of their work.
Leo Tolstoy defined his perspective of art
by whether what the creator intended
was experienced by the person
on the other end.
Today's artists can know
what we're feeling.
But regardless of whether
it's art or human connection,
today's technologies
will know and can know
what we're experiencing on the other side,
and this means we can be
closer and more authentic.
But I realize a lot of us
have a really hard time
with the idea of sharing our data,
and especially the idea
that people know things about us
that we didn't actively choose to share.
Anytime we talk to someone,
look at someone
or choose not to look,
data is exchanged, given away,
that people use to learn,
make decisions about
their lives and about ours.
I'm not looking to create a world
where our inner lives are ripped open
and our personal data
and our privacy given away
to people and entities
where we don't want to see it go.
But I am looking to create a world
where we can care about
each other more effectively,
we can know more about when
someone is feeling something
that we ought to pay attention to.
And we can have richer experiences
from our technology.
Any technology
can be used for good or bad.
Transparency to engagement
and effective regulation
are absolutely critical
to building the trust for any of this.
But the benefits that "empathetic
technology" can bring to our lives
are worth solving the problems
that make us uncomfortable.
And if we don't, there are
too many opportunities and feelings
we're going to be missing out on.
Thank you.
(Applause)
I have been teaching for a long time,
and in doing so
have acquired a body of knowledge about kids and learning
that I really wish more people would understand
about the potential of students.
In 1931, my grandmother --
bottom left for you guys over here --
graduated from the eighth grade.
She went to school to get the information
because that's where the information lived.
It was in the books; it was inside the teacher's head;
and she needed to go there to get the information,
because that's how you learned.
Fast-forward a generation:
this is the one-room schoolhouse, Oak Grove,
where my father went to a one-room schoolhouse.
And he again had to travel to the school
to get the information from the teacher,
stored it in the only portable memory he has, which is inside his own head,
and take it with him,
because that is how information was being transported
from teacher to student and then used in the world.
When I was a kid,
we had a set of encyclopedias at my house.
It was purchased the year I was born,
and it was extraordinary,
because I did not have to wait to go to the library to get to the information.
The information was inside my house
and it was awesome.
This was different
than either generation had experienced before,
and it changed the way I interacted with information
even at just a small level.
But the information was closer to me.
I could get access to it.
In the time that passes
between when I was a kid in high school
and when I started teaching,
we really see the advent of the Internet.
Right about the time that the Internet gets going
as an educational tool,
I take off from Wisconsin
and move to Kansas, small town Kansas,
where I had an opportunity to teach
in a lovely, small-town,
rural Kansas school district,
where I was teaching my favorite subject,
American government.
My first year -- super gung-ho -- going to teach American government,
loved the political system.
Kids in the 12th grade:
not exactly all that enthusiastic
about the American government system.
Year two: learned a few things -- had to change my tactic.
And I put in front of them an authentic experience
that allowed them to learn for themselves.
I didn't tell them what to do or how to do it.
I posed a problem in front of them,
which was to put on an election forum for their own community.
They produced flyers. They called offices.
They checked schedules. They were meeting with secretaries.
They produced an election forum booklet
for the entire town to learn more about their candidates.
They invited everyone into the school
for an evening of conversation
about government and politics
and whether or not the streets were done well,
and really had this robust experiential learning.
The older teachers -- more experienced --
looked at me and went,
"Oh, there she is. That's so cute. She's trying to get that done."
(Laughter)
"She doesn't know what she's in for."
But I knew that the kids would show up,
and I believed it,
and I told them every week what I expected out of them.
And that night, all 90 kids --
dressed appropriately, doing their job, owning it.
I had to just sit and watch.
It was theirs. It was experiential. It was authentic.
It meant something to them.
And they will step up.
From Kansas, I moved on to lovely Arizona,
where I taught in Flagstaff for a number of years,
this time with middle school students.
Luckily, I didn't have to teach them American government.
Could teach them the more exciting topic of geography.
Again, "thrilled" to learn.
But what was interesting
about this position I found myself in in Arizona,
was I had this really
extraordinarily eclectic group of kids to work with
in a truly public school,
and we got to have these moments where we would get these opportunities.
And one opportunity
was we got to go and meet Paul Rusesabagina,
which is the gentleman
that the movie "Hotel Rwanda" is based after.
And he was going to speak at the high school next door to us.
We could walk there. We didn't even have to pay for the buses.
There was no expense cost. Perfect field trip.
The problem then becomes
how do you take seventh- and eighth-graders to a talk about genocide
and deal with the subject in a way
that is responsible and respectful,
and they know what to do with it.
And so we chose to look at Paul Rusesabagina
as an example of a gentleman
who singularly used his life to do something positive.
I then challenged the kids to identify
someone in their own life, or in their own story, or in their own world,
that they could identify that had done a similar thing.
I asked them to produce a little movie about it.
It's the first time we'd done this.
Nobody really knew how to make these little movies on the computer,
but they were into it. And I asked them to put their own voice over it.
It was the most awesome moment of revelation
that when you ask kids to use their own voice
and ask them to speak for themselves,
what they're willing to share.
The last question of the assignment is:
how do you plan to use your life
to positively impact other people?
The things that kids will say
when you ask them and take the time to listen
is extraordinary.
Fast-forward to Pennsylvania, where I find myself today.
I teach at the Science Leadership Academy,
which is a partnership school between the Franklin Institute
and the school district of Philadelphia.
We are a nine through 12 public school,
but we do school quite differently.
I moved there primarily
to be part of a learning environment
that validated the way that I knew that kids learned,
and that really wanted to investigate
what was possible
when you are willing to let go
of some of the paradigms of the past,
of information scarcity when my grandmother was in school
and when my father was in school and even when I was in school,
and to a moment when we have information surplus.
So what do you do when the information is all around you?
Why do you have kids come to school
if they no longer have to come there to get the information?
In Philadelphia we have a one-to-one laptop program,
so the kids are bringing in laptops with them everyday,
taking them home, getting access to information.
And here's the thing that you need to get comfortable with
when you've given the tool
to acquire information to students,
is that you have to be comfortable with this idea
of allowing kids to fail
as part of the learning process.
We deal right now in the educational landscape
with an infatuation
with the culture of one right answer
that can be properly bubbled on the average multiple choice test,
and I am here to share with you:
it is not learning.
That is the absolute wrong thing to ask,
to tell kids to never be wrong.
To ask them to always have the right answer
doesn't allow them to learn.
So we did this project,
and this is one of the artifacts of the project.
I almost never show them off
because of the issue of the idea of failure.
My students produced these info-graphics
as a result of a unit that we decided to do at the end of the year
responding to the oil spill.
I asked them to take the examples that we were seeing
of the info-graphics that existed
in a lot of mass media,
and take a look at what were the interesting components of it,
and produce one for themselves
of a different man-made disaster from American history.
And they had certain criteria to do it.
They were a little uncomfortable with it,
because we'd never done this before, and they didn't know exactly how to do it.
They can talk -- they're very smooth,
and they can write very, very well,
but asking them to communicate ideas in a different way
was a little uncomfortable for them.
But I gave them the room to just do the thing.
Go create. Go figure it out.
Let's see what we can do.
And the student that persistently
turns out the best visual product did not disappoint.
This was done in like two or three days.
And this is the work of the student that consistently did it.
And when I sat the students down, I said, "Who's got the best one?"
And they immediately went, "There it is."
Didn't read anything. "There it is."
And I said, "Well what makes it great?"
And they're like, "Oh, the design's good, and he's using good color.
And there's some ... " And they went through all that we processed out loud.
And I said, "Go read it."
And they're like, "Oh, that one wasn't so awesome."
And then we went to another one --
it didn't have great visuals, but it had great information --
and spent an hour talking about the learning process,
because it wasn't about whether or not it was perfect,
or whether or not it was what I could create.
It asked them to create for themselves,
and it allowed them to fail,
process, learn from.
And when we do another round of this in my class this year,
they will do better this time,
because learning
has to include an amount of failure,
because failure is instructional
in the process.
There are a million pictures
that I could click through here,
and had to choose carefully -- this is one of my favorites --
of students learning,
of what learning can look like
in a landscape where we let go of the idea
that kids have to come to school to get the information,
but instead, ask them what they can do with it.
Ask them really interesting questions.
They will not disappoint.
Ask them to go to places,
to see things for themselves,
to actually experience the learning,
to play, to inquire.
This is one of my favorite photos,
because this was taken on Tuesday,
when I asked the students to go to the polls.
This is Robbie, and this was his first day of voting,
and he wanted to share that with everybody and do that.
But this is learning too,
because we asked them to go out into real spaces.
The main point
is that, if we continue to look at education
as if it's about coming to school
to get the information
and not about experiential learning,
empowering student voice and embracing failure,
we're missing the mark.
And everything that everybody is talking about today
isn't possible if we keep having an educational system
that does not value these qualities,
because we won't get there with a standardized test,
and we won't get there with a culture of one right answer.
We know how to do this better,
and it's time to do better.
(Applause)
When I heard those bars
slam hard,
I knew it was for real.
I feel confused.
I feel betrayed.
I feel overwhelmed.
I feel silenced.
What just happened?
How could they send me here?
I don't belong here.
How could they make such a huge mistake
without any repercussions
whatsoever to their actions?
I see large groups of women
in tattered uniforms
surrounded by huge walls and gates,
enclosed by iron barbed wires,
and I get hit by an awful stench,
and I ask myself,
how did I move
from working in the respected
financial banking sector,
having worked so hard in school,
to now being locked up
in the largest correctional facility
for women in Kenya?
My first night
at Langata Women Maximum Security Prison
was the toughest.
In January of 2009,
I was informed that I had handled
a fraudulent transaction unknowingly
at the bank where I worked.
I was shocked, scared and terrified.
I would lose a career
that I loved passionately.
But that was not the worst.
It got even worse
than I could have ever imagined.
I got arrested,
maliciously charged
and prosecuted.
The absurdity of it all
was the arresting officer
asking me to pay him 10,000 US dollars
and the case would disappear.
I refused.
Two and a half years on,
in and out of courts,
fighting to prove my innocence.
It was all over the media,
in the newspapers, TV, radio.
They came to me again.
This time around, said to me,
"If you give us 50,000 US dollars,
the judgement will be in your favor,"
irrespective of the fact
that there was no evidence whatsoever
that I had any wrongdoing
on the charges that I was up against.
I remember the events
of my conviction
six years ago
as if it were yesterday.
The cold, hard face of the judge
as she pronounced my sentence
on a cold Thursday morning
for a crime that I hadn't committed.
I remember holding
my three-month-old beautiful daughter
whom I had just named Oma,
which in my dialect
means "truth and justice,"
as that was what I had longed so much for
all this time.
I dressed her in her
favorite purple dress,
and here she was, about to accompany me
to serve this one-year sentence
behind bars.
The guards did not seem
sensitive to the trauma
that this experience was causing me.
My dignity and humanity disappeared
with the admission process.
It involved me being
searched for contrabands,
changed from my ordinary clothes
to the prison uniform,
forced to squat on the ground,
a posture that I soon came to learn
would form the routine
of the thousands of searches,
number counts,
that lay ahead of me.
The women told me,
"You'll adjust to this place.
You'll fit right in."
I was no longer referred to
as Teresa Njoroge.
The number 415/11 was my new identity,
and I soon learned that was
the case with the other women
who we were sharing this space with.
And adjust I did to life on the inside:
the prison food,
the prison language,
the prison life.
Prison is certainly no fairytale world.
What I didn't see come my way
was the women and children
whom we served time and shared space with,
women who had been imprisoned
for crimes of the system,
the corruption that requires a fall guy,
a scapegoat,
so that the person who is responsible
could go free,
a broken system that routinely
vilifies the vulnerable,
the poorest amongst us,
people who cannot afford to pay bail
or bribes.
And so we moved on.
As I listened to story after story
of these close to 700 women
during that one year in prison,
I soon realized that crime
was not what had brought
these women to prison,
most of them,
far from it.
It had started with the education system,
whose supply and quality
is not equal for all;
lack of economic opportunities
that pushes these women
to petty survival crimes;
the health system,
social justice system,
the criminal justice system.
If any of these women,
who were mostly from poor backgrounds,
fall through the cracks
in the already broken system,
the bottom of that chasm is a prison,
period.
By the time I completed
my one-year sentence
at Langata Women Maximum Prison,
I had a burning conviction
to be part of the transformation
to resolve the injustices
that I had witnessed
of women and girls
who were caught up in a revolving door
of a life in and out of prison
due to poverty.
After my release,
I set up Clean Start.
Clean Start is a social enterprise
that seeks to give these women and girls
a second chance.
What we do is we build bridges for them.
We go into the prisons, train them,
give them skills, tools and support
to enable them to be able
to change their mindsets,
their behaviors and their attitudes.
We also build bridges into the prisons
from the corporate sector --
individuals, organizations
that will partner with Clean Start
to enable us to provide employment,
places to call home,
jobs, vocational training,
for these women, girls,
boys and men,
upon transition back into society.
I never thought
that one day
I would be giving stories
of the injustices that are so common
within the criminal justice system,
but here I am.
Every time I go back to prison,
I feel a little at home,
but it is the daunting work
to achieve the vision
that keeps me awake at night,
connecting the miles to Louisiana,
which is deemed as the incarceration
capital of the world,
carrying with me stories
of hundreds of women
whom I have met within the prisons,
some of whom are now
embracing their second chances,
and others who are still
on that bridge of life's journey.
I embody a line
from the great Maya Angelou.
"I come as one,
but I stand as 10,000."
(Applause)
For my story is singular,
but imagine with me
the millions of people
in prisons today,
yearning for freedom.
Three years post my conviction
and two years post my release,
I got cleared by the courts of appeal
of any wrongdoing.
(Applause)
Around the same time,
I got blessed with my son,
whom I named Uhuru,
which in my dialect means "freedom."
(Applause)
Because I had finally gotten the freedom
that I so longed for.
I come as one,
but I stand as 10,000,
encouraged by the hard-edged hope
that thousands of us have come together
to reform and transform
the criminal justice system,
encouraged that we are doing our jobs
as we are meant to do them.
And let us keep doing them
with no apology.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Today I'm going to talk about work.
And the question I want to ask
and answer is this:
"Why do we work?"
Why do we drag ourselves
out of bed every morning
instead of living our lives
just filled with bouncing from one
TED-like adventure to another?
(Laughter)
You may be asking yourselves
that very question.
Now, I know of course,
we have to make a living,
but nobody in this room thinks
that that's the answer to the question,
"Why do we work?"
For folks in this room,
the work we do is challenging,
it's engaging, it's stimulating,
it's meaningful.
And if we're lucky,
it might even be important.
So, we wouldn't work
if we didn't get paid,
but that's not why we do what we do.
And in general,
I think we think that material rewards
are a pretty bad reason
for doing the work that we do.
When we say of somebody
that he's "in it for the money,"
we are not just being descriptive.
(Laughter)
Now, I think this is totally obvious,
but the very obviousness of it
raises what is for me
an incredibly profound question.
Why, if this is so obvious,
why is it that for the overwhelming
majority of people on the planet,
the work they do
has none of the characteristics
that get us up and out of bed
and off to the office every morning?
How is it that we allow
the majority of people on the planet
to do work that is monotonous,
meaningless and soul-deadening?
Why is it that as capitalism developed,
it created a mode of production,
of goods and services,
in which all the nonmaterial satisfactions
that might come from work were eliminated?
Workers who do this kind of work,
whether they do it in factories,
in call centers,
or in fulfillment warehouses,
do it for pay.
There is certainly no other earthly reason
to do what they do except for pay.
So the question is, "Why?"
And here's the answer:
the answer is technology.
Now, I know, I know --
yeah, yeah, yeah, technology, automation
screws people, blah blah --
that's not what I mean.
I'm not talking about
the kind of technology
that has enveloped our lives,
and that people come to TED to hear about.
I'm not talking about
the technology of things,
profound though that is.
I'm talking about another technology.
I'm talking about the technology of ideas.
I call it, "idea technology" --
how clever of me.
(Laughter)
In addition to creating things,
science creates ideas.
Science creates ways of understanding.
And in the social sciences,
the ways of understanding that get created
are ways of understanding ourselves.
And they have an enormous influence
on how we think, what we aspire to,
and how we act.
If you think your poverty
is God's will, you pray.
If you think your poverty is the result
of your own inadequacy,
you shrink into despair.
And if you think your poverty is
the result of oppression and domination,
then you rise up in revolt.
Whether your response to poverty
is resignation or revolution,
depends on how you understand
the sources of your poverty.
This is the role that ideas play
in shaping us as human beings,
and this is why idea technology may be
the most profoundly important technology
that science gives us.
And there's something special
about idea technology,
that makes it different
from the technology of things.
With things, if the technology sucks,
it just vanishes, right?
Bad technology disappears.
With ideas --
false ideas about human beings
will not go away
if people believe that they're true.
Because if people believe
that they're true,
they create ways of living
and institutions
that are consistent
with these very false ideas.
And that's how the industrial revolution
created a factory system
in which there was really nothing you
could possibly get out of your day's work,
except for the pay at the end of the day.
Because the father --
one of the fathers
of the Industrial Revolution,
Adam Smith --
was convinced that human beings
were by their very natures lazy,
and wouldn't do anything
unless you made it worth their while,
and the way you made it worth their while
was by incentivizing,
by giving them rewards.
That was the only reason
anyone ever did anything.
So we created a factory system consistent
with that false view of human nature.
But once that system
of production was in place,
there was really no other way
for people to operate,
except in a way that was consistent
with Adam Smith's vision.
So the work example is merely an example
of how false ideas
can create a circumstance
that ends up making them true.
It is not true
that you "just can't get
good help anymore."
It is true
that you "can't get good help anymore"
when you give people work to do
that is demeaning and soulless.
And interestingly enough, Adam Smith --
the same guy who gave us
this incredible invention
of mass production, and division of labor
-- understood this.
He said, of people who worked
in assembly lines,
of men who worked
in assembly lines, he says:
"He generally becomes as stupid as it is
possible for a human being to become."
Now, notice the word here is "become."
"He generally becomes as stupid as it is
possible for a human being to become."
Whether he intended it or not,
what Adam Smith was telling us there,
is that the very shape of the institution
within which people work
creates people who are fitted
to the demands of that institution
and deprives people of the opportunity
to derive the kinds of satisfactions
from their work that we take for granted.
The thing about science --
natural science --
is that we can spin fantastic
theories about the cosmos,
and have complete confidence
that the cosmos is completely
indifferent to our theories.
It's going to work the same damn way
no matter what theories
we have about the cosmos.
But we do have to worry about
the theories we have of human nature,
because human nature will be changed
by the theories we have
that are designed to explain
and help us understand human beings.
The distinguished anthropologist,
Clifford Geertz, said, years ago,
that human beings
are the "unfinished animals."
And what he meant by that
was that it is only human nature
to have a human nature
that is very much the product
of the society in which people live.
That human nature,
that is to say our human nature,
is much more created
than it is discovered.
We design human nature
by designing the institutions
within which people live and work.
And so you people --
pretty much the closest I ever get
to being with masters of the universe --
you people should be asking
yourself a question,
as you go back home
to run your organizations.
Just what kind of human nature
do you want to help design?
Thank you.
(Applause)
Thanks.
So, I'm afraid.
Right now,
on this stage,
I feel fear.
In my life, I ain't met many people
that will readily admit
when they are afraid.
And I think that's because deep down,
they know how easy it spreads.
See, fear is like a disease.
When it moves, it moves like wildfire.
But what happens when,
even in the face of that fear,
you do what you've got to do?
That's called courage.
And just like fear,
courage is contagious.
See, I'm from East St. Louis, Illinois.
That's a small city
across the Mississippi River
from St. Louis, Missouri.
I have lived in and around
St. Louis my entire life.
When Michael Brown, Jr.,
an ordinary teenager,
was gunned down by police in 2014
in Ferguson, Missouri --
another suburb, but north of St. Louis --
I remember thinking,
he ain't the first,
and he won't be the last young kid
to lose his life to law enforcement.
But see, his death was different.
When Mike was killed,
I remember the powers that be
trying to use fear as a weapon.
The police response to a community
in mourning was to use force
to impose fear:
fear of militarized police,
imprisonment,
fines.
The media even tried
to make us afraid of each other
by the way they spun the story.
And all of these things
have worked in the past.
But like I said,
this time it was different.
Michael Brown's death and the subsequent
treatment of the community
led to a string of protests in and around
Ferguson and St. Louis.
When I got out to those protests
about the fourth or fifth day,
it was not out of courage;
it was out of guilt.
See, I'm black.
I don't know if y'all noticed that.
(Laughter)
But I couldn't sit in St. Louis,
minutes away from Ferguson,
and not go see.
So I got off my ass to go check it out.
When I got out there,
I found something surprising.
I found anger; there was a lot of that.
But what I found more of was love.
People with love for themselves.
Love for their community.
And it was beautiful --
until the police showed up.
Then a new emotion was interjected
into the conversation:
fear.
Now, I'm not going to lie;
when I saw those armored vehicles,
and all that gear
and all those guns
and all those police
I was terrified --
personally.
And when I looked around that crowd,
I saw a lot of people that had
the same thing going on.
But I also saw people
with something else inside of them.
That was courage.
See, those people yelled,
and they screamed,
and they were not about
to back down from the police.
They were past that point.
And then I could feel
something in me changing,
so I yelled and I screamed,
and I noticed that everybody around me
was doing the same thing.
And there was nothing like that feeling.
So I decided I wanted
to do something more.
I went home, I thought:
I'm an artist. I make shit.
So I started making things
specific to the protest,
things that would be weapons
in a spiritual war,
things that would give people voice
and things that would fortify them
for the road ahead.
I did a project where I took pictures
of the hands of protesters
and put them up and down
the boarded-up buildings
and community shops.
My goal was to raise awareness
and to raise the morale.
And I think, for a minute at least,
it did just that.
Then I thought, I want to uplift
the stories of these people
I was watching being
courageous in the moment.
And myself and my friend,
and filmmaker and partner Sabaah Folayan
did just that with our documentary,
"Whose Streets?"
I kind of became a conduit
for all of this courage
that was given to me.
And I think that's part
of our job as artists.
I think we should be conveyors
of courage in the work that we do.
And I think that we are the wall
between the normal folks
and the people that use their power
to spread fear and hate,
especially in times like these.
So I'm going to ask you.
Y'all the movers and the shakers,
you know, the thought leaders:
What are you gonna do
with the gifts that you've been given
to break us from the fear
the binds us every day?
Because, see, I'm afraid every day.
I can't remember a time when I wasn't.
But once I figured out that fear
was not put in me to cripple me,
it was there to protect me,
and once I figured out
how to use that fear,
I found my power.
Thank you.
(Applause)
I could never have imagined
that a 19-year-old suicide bomber
would actually teach me a valuable lesson.
But he did.
He taught me to never presume anything
about anyone you don't know.
On a Thursday morning in July 2005,
the bomber and I, unknowingly,
boarded the same train carriage
at the same time,
standing, apparently, just feet apart.
I didn't see him.
Actually, I didn't see anyone.
You know not to look
at anyone on the Tube,
but I guess he saw me.
I guess he looked at all of us,
as his hand hovered
over the detonation switch.
I've often wondered: What was he thinking?
Especially in those final seconds.
I know it wasn't personal.
He didn't set out to kill
or maim me, Gill Hicks.
I mean -- he didn't know me.
No.
Instead, he gave me
an unwarranted and an unwanted label.
I had become the enemy.
To him, I was the "other,"
the "them," as opposed to "us."
The label "enemy" allowed him
to dehumanize us.
It allowed him to push that button.
And he wasn't selective.
Twenty-six precious lives were taken
in my carriage alone,
and I was almost one of them.
In the time it takes to draw a breath,
we were plunged into a darkness so immense
that it was almost tangible;
what I imagine wading
through tar might be like.
We didn't know we were the enemy.
We were just a bunch of commuters
who, minutes earlier,
had followed the Tube etiquette:
no direct eye contact,
no talking
and absolutely no conversation.
But in the lifting of the darkness,
we were reaching out.
We were helping each other.
We were calling out our names,
a little bit like a roll call,
waiting for responses.
"I'm Gill. I'm here.
I'm alive.
OK."
"I'm Gill.
Here.
Alive.
OK."
I didn't know Alison.
But I listened for her check-ins
every few minutes.
I didn't know Richard.
But it mattered to me that he survived.
All I shared with them
was my first name.
They didn't know
that I was a head of a department
at the Design Council.
And here is my beloved briefcase,
also rescued from that morning.
They didn't know that I published
architecture and design journals,
that I was a Fellow
of the Royal Society of Arts,
that I wore black --
still do --
that I smoked cigarillos.
I don't smoke cigarillos anymore.
I drank gin and I watched TED Talks,
of course, never dreaming
that one day I would be standing,
balancing on prosthetic legs,
giving a talk.
I was a young Australian woman
doing extraordinary things in London.
And I wasn't ready for that all to end.
I was so determined to survive
that I used my scarf to tie tourniquets
around the tops of my legs,
and I just shut everything
and everyone out,
to focus, to listen to myself,
to be guided by instinct alone.
I lowered my breathing rate.
I elevated my thighs.
I held myself upright
and I fought the urge to close my eyes.
I held on for almost an hour,
an hour to contemplate
the whole of my life
up until this point.
Perhaps I should have done more.
Perhaps I could have
lived more, seen more.
Maybe I should have gone running,
dancing, taken up yoga.
But my priority and my focus
was always my work.
I lived to work.
Who I was on my business card
mattered to me.
But it didn't matter down in that tunnel.
By the time I felt that first touch
from one of my rescuers,
I was unable to speak,
unable to say even
a small word, like "Gill."
I surrendered my body to them.
I had done all I possibly could,
and now I was in their hands.
I understood
just who and what humanity really is,
when I first saw the ID tag
that was given to me
when I was admitted to hospital.
And it read:
"One unknown estimated female."
One unknown estimated female.
Those four words were my gift.
What they told me very clearly
was that my life was saved,
purely because I was a human being.
Difference of any kind made no difference
to the extraordinary lengths
that the rescuers were prepared to go
to save my life,
to save as many unknowns as they could,
and putting their own lives at risk.
To them, it didn't matter
if I was rich or poor,
the color of my skin,
whether I was male or female,
my sexual orientation,
who I voted for,
whether I was educated,
if I had a faith or no faith at all.
Nothing mattered
other than I was a precious human life.
I see myself as a living fact.
I am proof
that unconditional love and respect
can not only save,
but it can transform lives.
Here is a wonderful image
of one of my rescuers, Andy, and I
taken just last year.
Ten years after the event,
and here we are, arm in arm.
Throughout all the chaos,
my hand was held tightly.
My face was stroked gently.
What did I feel?
I felt loved.
What's shielded me from hatred
and wanting retribution,
what's given me the courage to say:
this ends with me
is love.
I was loved.
I believe the potential
for widespread positive change
is absolutely enormous
because I know what we're capable of.
I know the brilliance of humanity.
So this leaves me with some
pretty big things to ponder
and some questions for us all to consider:
Is what unites us not far greater
than what can ever divide?
Does it have to take
a tragedy or a disaster
for us to feel deeply
connected as one species,
as human beings?
And when will we embrace
the wisdom of our era
to rise above mere tolerance
and move to an acceptance
for all who are only a label
until we know them?
Thank you.
(Applause)
Namaste. Salaam.
Shalom. Sat Sri Akal.
Greetings to all of you from Pakistan.
It is often said that we fear that which we do not know.
And Pakistan, in this particular vein, is very similar.
Because it has provoked, and does provoke,
a visceral anxiety in the bellies of many a Western soul,
especially when viewed through the monochromatic lens
of turbulence and turmoil.
But there are many other dimensions to Pakistan.
And what follows is a stream of images,
a series of images captured by some of Pakistan's
most dynamic and young photographers,
that aims to give you an alternative glimpse,
a look inside the hearts and minds
of some ordinary Pakistani citizens.
Here are some of the stories they wanted us to share with you.
My name is Abdul Khan. I come from Peshawar.
I hope that you will be able to see
not just my Taliban-like beard,
but also the richness and color
of my perceptions, aspirations and dreams,
as rich and colorful as the satchels that I sell.
My name is Meher and this is my friend Irim.
I hope to become a vet when I grow up
so that I can take care of stray cats and dogs
who wander around the streets of the village
that I live near Gilgit, northern Pakistan.
My name is Kailash. And I like to enrich lives
through technicolored glass.
Madame, would you like some of those orange bangles
with the pink polka dots?
My name is Zamin.
And I'm an IDP, an internally displaced person,
from Swat.
Do you see me on the other side of this fence?
Do I matter, or really exist for you?
My name is Iman. I am a fashion model,
an up-and-coming model from Lahore.
Do you see me simply smothered in cloth?
Or can you move beyond my veil
and see me for who I truly am inside?
My name is Ahmed. I am an Afghan refugee
from the Khyber agency.
I have come from a place of intense darkness.
And that is why I want to illuminate the world.
My name is Papusay.
My heart and drum beat as one.
If religion is the opium of the masses,
then for me, music is my one and only ganja.
A rising tide lifts all boats.
And the rising tide of India's
spectacular economic growth
has lifted over 400 million
Indians into a buoyant middle class.
But there are still over 650 million Indians,
Pakistanis, Sri Lankans, Bangladeshis, Nepalese,
who remain washed up on the shores of poverty.
Therefore as India and Pakistan, as you and I,
it behooves us to transcend our differences,
to celebrate our diversity,
to leverage our common humanity.
Our collective vision at Naya Jeevan,
which for many of you, as you all recognize,
means "new life" in Urdu and Hindi,
is to rejuvenate the lives of millions of low income families
by providing them with affordable access
to catastrophic health care.
Indeed it is the emerging world's first
HMO for the urban working poor.
Why should we do this as Indians and Pakistanis?
We are but two threads cut from the same cloth.
And if our fates are intertwined,
then we believe that it is good karma, it is good fortune.
And for many of us, our fortunes do indeed lie
at the bottom of the pyramid. Thank you.
(Applause)
Chris Anderson: Fantastic. Just stay up here.
That was fantastic.
I found that really moving.
You know, we fought hard to get at least
a small Pakistani contingent to come.
It felt like it was really important.
They went through a lot to get here.
Would the Pakistanis please just stand up please?
I just really wanted to acknowledge you.
(Applause)
Thank you so much.
When I was a kid, I was obsessed
with the Guinness Book of World Records,
and I really wanted
to set a world record myself.
But there was just one small problem:
I had absolutely no talent.
So I decided to set
a world record in something
that demanded absolutely no skill at all.
I decided to set a world record
in crawling.
(Laughter)
Now, the record at the time
was 12 and a half miles,
and for some reason,
this seemed totally manageable.
(Laughter)
I recruited my friend Anne,
and together we decided,
we didn't even need to train.
(Laughter)
And on the day of our record attempt,
we put furniture pads
on the outside of our good luck jeans
and we set off,
and right away, we were in trouble,
because the denim was against our skin
and it began to chafe,
and soon our knees were being chewed up.
Hours in,
it began to rain.
Then, Anne dropped out.
Then, it got dark.
Now, by now, my knees
were bleeding through my jeans,
and I was hallucinating from the cold
and the pain and the monotony.
And to give you an idea
of the suffer-fest that I was undergoing,
the first lap around
the high school track took 10 minutes.
The last lap took almost 30.
After 12 hours of crawling,
I stopped,
and I had gone eight and a half miles.
So I was short of
the 12-and-a-half-mile record.
Now, for many years, I thought
this was a story of abject failure,
but today I see it differently,
because when I was
attempting the world record,
I was doing three things.
I was getting outside my comfort zone,
I was calling upon my resilience,
and I was finding confidence in myself
and my own decisions.
I didn't know it then,
but those are not
the attributes of failure.
Those are the attributes of bravery.
Now, in 1989, at the age of 26,
I became a San Francisco firefighter,
and I was the 15th woman
in a department of 1,500 men.
(Applause)
And as you can imagine, when I arrived
there were many doubts
about whether we could do the job.
So even though I was a 5'10",
150-pound collegiate rower,
and someone who could endure
12 hours of searing knee pain --
(Laughter)
I knew I still had to prove
my strength and fitness.
So one day a call came in for a fire,
and sure enough,
when my engine group pulled up,
there was black smoke billowing
from a building off an alleyway.
And I was with a big guy named Skip,
and he was on the nozzle,
and I was right behind,
and it was a typical sort of fire.
It was smoky, it was hot,
and all of a sudden,
there was an explosion,
and Skip and I were blown backwards,
my mask was knocked sideways,
and there was this moment of confusion.
And then I picked myself up,
I groped for the nozzle,
and I did what a firefighter
was supposed to do:
I lunged forward,
opened up the water
and I tackled the fire myself.
The explosion had been caused
by a water heater,
so nobody was hurt,
and ultimately it was not a big deal,
but later Skip came up to me and said,
"Nice job, Caroline,"
in this surprised sort of voice.
(Laughter)
And I was confused, because
the fire hadn't been difficult physically,
so why was he looking at me
with something like astonishment?
And then it became clear:
Skip, who was by the way a really nice guy
and an excellent firefighter,
not only thought
that women could not be strong,
he thought that they
could not be brave either.
And he wasn't the only one.
Friends, acquaintances and strangers,
men and women throughout my career
ask me over and over,
"Caroline, all that fire, all that danger,
aren't you scared?"
Honestly, I never heard
a male firefighter asked this.
And I became curious.
Why wasn't bravery expected of women?
Now, the answer began to come
when a friend of mine lamented to me
that her young daughter
was a big scaredy-cat,
and so I began to notice,
and yes, the daughter was anxious,
but more than that,
the parents were anxious.
Most of what they said to her
when she was outside began with,
"Be careful," "Watch out," or "No."
Now, my friends were not bad parents.
They were just doing what most parents do,
which is cautioning their daughters
much more than they caution their sons.
There was a study involving
a playground fire pole, ironically,
in which researchers saw that little girls
were very likely to be warned
by both their moms and dads
about the fire pole's risk,
and if the little girls
still wanted to play on the fire pole,
a parent was very likely to assist her.
But the little boys?
They were encouraged
to play on the fire pole
despite any trepidations
that they might have,
and often the parents offered
guidance on how to use it on their own.
So what message does this send
to both boys and girls?
Well, that girls are fragile
and more in need of help,
and that boys can and should
master difficult tasks by themselves.
It says that girls should be fearful
and boys should be gutsy.
Now, the irony is that at this young age,
girls and boys are actually
very alike physically.
In fact, girls are often
stronger until puberty,
and more mature.
And yet we adults act
as if girls are more fragile
and more in need of help,
and they can't handle as much.
This is the message
that we absorb as kids,
and this is the message
that fully permeates as we grow up.
We women believe it, men believe it,
and guess what?
As we become parents,
we pass it on to our children,
and so it goes.
Well, so now I had my answer.
This is why women, even firewomen,
were expected to be scared.
This is why women often are scared.
Now, I know some of you
won't believe me when I tell you this,
but I am not against fear.
I know it's an important emotion,
and it's there to keep us safe.
But the problem is
when fear is the primary reaction
that we teach and encourage in girls
whenever they face something
outside their comfort zone.
So I was a paraglider pilot
for many years --
(Applause)
and a paraglider is a parachute-like wing,
and it does fly very well,
but to many people I realize
it looks just like a bedsheet
with strings attached.
(Laughter)
And I spent a lot of time on mountaintops
inflating this bedsheet,
running off and flying.
And I know what you're thinking.
You're like, Caroline,
a little fear would make sense here.
And you're right, it does.
I assure you, I did feel fear.
But on that mountaintop,
waiting for the wind
to come in just right,
I felt so many other things, too:
exhilaration, confidence.
I knew I was a good pilot.
I knew the conditions were good,
or I wouldn't be there.
I knew how great it was going to be
a thousand feet in the air.
So yes, fear was there,
but I would take a good hard look at it,
assess just how relevant it was
and then put it where it belonged,
which was more often than not
behind my exhilaration, my anticipation
and my confidence.
So I'm not against fear.
I'm just pro-bravery.
Now, I'm not saying
your girls must be firefighters
or that they should be paragliders,
but I am saying that we are raising
our girls to be timid, even helpless,
and it begins when we caution them
against physical risk.
The fear we learn
and the experiences we don't
stay with us as we become women
and morphs into all those things
that we face and try to shed:
our hesitation in speaking out,
our deference so that we can be liked
and our lack of confidence
in our own decisions.
So how do we become brave?
Well, here's the good news.
Bravery is learned,
and like anything learned,
it just needs to be practiced.
So first,
we have to take a deep breath
and encourage our girls
to skateboard, climb trees
and clamber around
on that playground fire pole.
This is what my own mother did.
She didn't know it then,
but researchers have a name for this.
They call it risky play,
and studies show that risky play
is really important for kids, all kids,
because it teaches hazard assessment,
it teaches delayed gratification,
it teaches resilience,
it teaches confidence.
In other words,
when kids get outside
and practice bravery,
they learn valuable life lessons.
Second, we have to stop
cautioning our girls willy-nilly.
So notice next time you say,
"Watch out, you're going to get hurt,"
or, "Don't do that, it's dangerous."
And remember that often
what you're really telling her
is that she shouldn't be pushing herself,
that she's really not good enough,
that she should be afraid.
Third,
we women have to start
practicing bravery, too.
We cannot teach our girls
until we teach ourselves.
So here's another thing:
fear and exhilaration
feel very similar --
the shaky hands,
the heightened heart rate,
the nervous tension,
and I'm betting that for many of you
the last time you thought
you were scared out of your wits,
you may have been feeling
mostly exhilaration,
and now you've missed an opportunity.
So practice.
And while girls should be getting
outside to learn to be gutsy,
I get that adults don't want
to get on hoverboards or climb trees,
so we all should be practicing
at home, in the office
and even right here getting up the guts
to talk to someone that you really admire.
Finally, when your girl is, let's say,
on her bike on the top of the steep hill
that she insists
she's too scared to go down,
guide her to access her bravery.
Ultimately, maybe that hill
really is too steep,
but she'll come to that conclusion
through courage, not fear.
Because this is not
about the steep hill in front of her.
This is about the life ahead of her
and that she has the tools
to handle and assess
all the dangers
that we cannot protect her from,
all the challenges that we won't
be there to guide her through,
everything that our girls here
and around the world
face in their future.
So by the way,
the world record for crawling today --
(Laughter)
is 35.18 miles,
and I would really love
to see a girl go break that.
(Applause)
So I'd like you to imagine for a moment
that you're a soldier
in the heat of battle.
Maybe you're a Roman foot soldier
or a medieval archer
or maybe you're a Zulu warrior.
Regardless of your time and place,
there are some things that are constant.
Your adrenaline is elevated,
and your actions are stemming
from these deeply ingrained reflexes,
reflexes rooted in a need
to protect yourself and your side
and to defeat the enemy.
So now, I'd like you to imagine
playing a very different role,
that of the scout.
The scout's job is not
to attack or defend.
The scout's job is to understand.
The scout is the one going out,
mapping the terrain,
identifying potential obstacles.
And the scout may hope to learn
that, say, there's a bridge
in a convenient location across a river.
But above all, the scout
wants to know what's really there,
as accurately as possible.
And in a real, actual army, both
the soldier and the scout are essential.
But you can also think of each
of these roles as a mindset --
a metaphor for how all of us
process information and ideas
in our daily lives.
What I'm going to argue today
is that having good judgment,
making accurate predictions,
making good decisions,
is mostly about which mindset you're in.
To illustrate these mindsets in action,
I'm going to take you back
to 19th-century France,
where this innocuous-looking
piece of paper
launched one of the biggest
political scandals in history.
It was discovered in 1894
by officers in the French general staff.
It was torn up in a wastepaper basket,
but when they pieced it back together,
they discovered
that someone in their ranks
had been selling
military secrets to Germany.
So they launched a big investigation,
and their suspicions
quickly converged on this man,
Alfred Dreyfus.
He had a sterling record,
no past history of wrongdoing,
no motive as far as they could tell.
But Dreyfus was the only
Jewish officer at that rank in the army,
and unfortunately at this time,
the French Army was highly anti-Semitic.
They compared Dreyfus's handwriting
to that on the memo
and concluded that it was a match,
even though outside
professional handwriting experts
were much less confident
in the similarity,
but never mind that.
They went and searched
Dreyfus's apartment,
looking for any signs of espionage.
They went through his files,
and they didn't find anything.
This just convinced them more
that Dreyfus was not only guilty,
but sneaky as well, because clearly
he had hidden all of the evidence
before they had managed to get to it.
Next, they went and looked
through his personal history
for any incriminating details.
They talked to his teachers,
they found that he had studied
foreign languages in school,
which clearly showed a desire
to conspire with foreign governments
later in life.
His teachers also said that Dreyfus
was known for having a good memory,
which was highly suspicious, right?
You know, because a spy
has to remember a lot of things.
So the case went to trial,
and Dreyfus was found guilty.
Afterwards, they took him out
into this public square
and ritualistically tore
his insignia from his uniform
and broke his sword in two.
This was called
the Degradation of Dreyfus.
And they sentenced him
to life imprisonment
on the aptly named Devil's Island,
which is this barren rock
off the coast of South America.
So there he went,
and there he spent his days alone,
writing letters and letters
to the French government
begging them to reopen his case
so they could discover his innocence.
But for the most part,
France considered the matter closed.
One thing that's really interesting
to me about the Dreyfus Affair
is this question of why the officers
were so convinced
that Dreyfus was guilty.
I mean, you might even assume
that they were setting him up,
that they were intentionally framing him.
But historians don't think
that's what happened.
As far as we can tell,
the officers genuinely believed
that the case against Dreyfus was strong.
Which makes you wonder:
What does it say about the human mind
that we can find such paltry evidence
to be compelling enough to convict a man?
Well, this is a case of what scientists
call "motivated reasoning."
It's this phenomenon in which
our unconscious motivations,
our desires and fears,
shape the way we interpret information.
Some information, some ideas,
feel like our allies.
We want them to win.
We want to defend them.
And other information
or ideas are the enemy,
and we want to shoot them down.
So this is why I call
motivated reasoning, "soldier mindset."
Probably most of you have never persecuted
a French-Jewish officer for high treason,
I assume,
but maybe you've followed sports
or politics, so you might have noticed
that when the referee judges
that your team committed a foul,
for example,
you're highly motivated
to find reasons why he's wrong.
But if he judges that the other team
committed a foul -- awesome!
That's a good call,
let's not examine it too closely.
Or, maybe you've read
an article or a study
that examined some controversial policy,
like capital punishment.
And, as researchers have demonstrated,
if you support capital punishment
and the study shows
that it's not effective,
then you're highly motivated
to find all the reasons
why the study was poorly designed.
But if it shows
that capital punishment works,
it's a good study.
And vice versa: if you don't
support capital punishment, same thing.
Our judgment is strongly
influenced, unconsciously,
by which side we want to win.
And this is ubiquitous.
This shapes how we think
about our health, our relationships,
how we decide how to vote,
what we consider fair or ethical.
What's most scary to me
about motivated reasoning
or soldier mindset,
is how unconscious it is.
We can think we're being
objective and fair-minded
and still wind up ruining the life
of an innocent man.
However, fortunately for Dreyfus,
his story is not over.
This is Colonel Picquart.
He's another high-ranking officer
in the French Army,
and like most people,
he assumed Dreyfus was guilty.
Also like most people in the army,
he was at least casually anti-Semitic.
But at a certain point,
Picquart began to suspect:
"What if we're all wrong about Dreyfus?"
What happened was,
he had discovered evidence
that the spying for Germany had continued,
even after Dreyfus was in prison.
And he had also discovered
that another officer in the army
had handwriting that perfectly
matched the memo,
much closer than Dreyfus's handwriting.
So he brought these discoveries
to his superiors,
but to his dismay,
they either didn't care
or came up with elaborate rationalizations
to explain his findings,
like, "Well, all you've really shown,
Picquart, is that there's another spy
who learned how to mimic
Dreyfus's handwriting,
and he picked up the torch of spying
after Dreyfus left.
But Dreyfus is still guilty."
Eventually, Picquart managed
to get Dreyfus exonerated.
But it took him 10 years,
and for part of that time,
he himself was in prison
for the crime of disloyalty to the army.
A lot of people feel like Picquart
can't really be the hero of this story
because he was an anti-Semite
and that's bad, which I agree with.
But personally, for me,
the fact that Picquart was anti-Semitic
actually makes his actions more admirable,
because he had the same prejudices,
the same reasons to be biased
as his fellow officers,
but his motivation to find the truth
and uphold it trumped all of that.
So to me,
Picquart is a poster child
for what I call "scout mindset."
It's the drive not to make
one idea win or another lose,
but just to see what's really there
as honestly and accurately as you can,
even if it's not pretty
or convenient or pleasant.
This mindset is what
I'm personally passionate about.
And I've spent the last few years
examining and trying to figure out
what causes scout mindset.
Why are some people, sometimes at least,
able to cut through their own prejudices
and biases and motivations
and just try to see the facts
and the evidence
as objectively as they can?
And the answer is emotional.
So, just as soldier mindset
is rooted in emotions
like defensiveness or tribalism,
scout mindset is, too.
It's just rooted in different emotions.
For example, scouts are curious.
They're more likely to say
they feel pleasure
when they learn new information
or an itch to solve a puzzle.
They're more likely to feel intrigued
when they encounter something
that contradicts their expectations.
Scouts also have different values.
They're more likely to say
they think it's virtuous
to test your own beliefs,
and they're less likely to say
that someone who changes his mind
seems weak.
And above all, scouts are grounded,
which means their self-worth as a person
isn't tied to how right or wrong
they are about any particular topic.
So they can believe
that capital punishment works.
If studies come out showing
that it doesn't, they can say,
"Huh. Looks like I might be wrong.
Doesn't mean I'm bad or stupid."
This cluster of traits
is what researchers have found --
and I've also found anecdotally --
predicts good judgment.
And the key takeaway I want
to leave you with about those traits
is that they're primarily
not about how smart you are
or about how much you know.
In fact, they don't correlate
very much with IQ at all.
They're about how you feel.
There's a quote that I keep
coming back to, by Saint-Exupéry.
He's the author of "The Little Prince."
He said, "If you want to build a ship,
don't drum up your men
to collect wood and give orders
and distribute the work.
Instead, teach them to yearn
for the vast and endless sea."
In other words, I claim,
if we really want to improve
our judgment as individuals
and as societies,
what we need most
is not more instruction in logic
or rhetoric or probability or economics,
even though those things
are quite valuable.
But what we most need
to use those principles well
is scout mindset.
We need to change the way we feel.
We need to learn how to feel proud
instead of ashamed
when we notice we might
have been wrong about something.
We need to learn how to feel intrigued
instead of defensive
when we encounter some information
that contradicts our beliefs.
So the question I want
to leave you with is:
What do you most yearn for?
Do you yearn to defend your own beliefs?
Or do you yearn to see the world
as clearly as you possibly can?
Thank you.
(Applause)
What's one thing that every person
in this room is going to become?
Older.
And most of us are scared stiff
at the prospect.
How does that word make you feel?
I used to feel the same way.
What was I most worried about?
Ending up drooling
in some grim institutional hallway.
And then I learned that only
four percent of older Americans
are living in nursing homes,
and the percentage is dropping.
What else was I worried about?
Dementia.
Turns out that most of us
can think just fine to the end.
Dementia rates are dropping, too.
The real epidemic is anxiety
over memory loss.
(Laughter)
I also figured that old people
were depressed
because they were old
and they were going to die soon.
(Laughter)
It turns out that the longer people live,
the less they fear dying,
and that people are happiest at
the beginnings and the end of their lives.
It's called the U-curve of happiness,
and it's been borne out
by dozens of studies around the world.
You don't have to be a Buddhist
or a billionaire.
The curve is a function of the way
aging itself affects the brain.
So I started feeling a lot better
about getting older,
and I started obsessing about why
so few people know these things.
The reason is ageism:
discrimination and stereotyping
on the basis of age.
We experience it anytime someone assumes
we're too old for something,
instead of finding out who we are
and what we're capable of,
or too young.
Ageism cuts both ways.
All -isms are socially constructed
ideas -- racism, sexism, homophobia --
and that means we make them up,
and they can change over time.
All these prejudices
pit us against each other
to maintain the status quo,
like auto workers in the US competing
against auto workers in Mexico
instead of organizing for better wages.
(Applause)
We know it's not OK to allocate
resources by race or by sex.
Why should it be OK to weigh
the needs of the young against the old?
All prejudice relies on "othering" --
seeing a group of people
as other than ourselves:
other race, other religion,
other nationality.
The strange thing about ageism:
that other is us.
Ageism feeds on denial --
our reluctance to acknowledge
that we are going to become
that older person.
It's denial when we try
to pass for younger
or when we believe in anti-aging products,
or when we feel like our bodies
are betraying us,
simply because they are changing.
Why on earth do we stop celebrating
the ability to adapt and grow
as we move through life?
Why should aging well mean
struggling to look and move
like younger versions of ourselves?
It's embarrassing
to be called out as older
until we quit being embarrassed about it,
and it's not healthy to go through life
dreading our futures.
The sooner we get off
this hamster wheel of age denial,
the better off we are.
Stereotypes are always
a mistake, of course,
but especially when it comes to age,
because the longer we live,
the more different
from one another we become.
Right? Think about it.
And yet, we tend to think of everyone
in a retirement home
as the same age: old --
(Laughter)
when they can span four decades.
Can you imagine thinking that way
about a group of people
between the ages of 20 and 60?
When you get to a party, do you head
for people your own age?
Have you ever grumbled
about entitled millennials?
Have you ever rejected a haircut
or a relationship or an outing
because it's not age-appropriate?
For adults, there's no such thing.
All these behaviors are ageist.
We all do them,
and we can't challenge bias
unless we're aware of it.
Nobody's born ageist,
but it starts at early childhood,
around the same time attitudes
towards race and gender start to form,
because negative messages
about late life bombard us
from the media and popular
culture at every turn.
Right? Wrinkles are ugly.
Old people are pathetic.
It's sad to be old.
Look at Hollywood.
A survey of recent
Best Picture nominations
found that only 12 percent
of speaking or named characters
were age 60 and up,
and many of them
were portrayed as impaired.
Older people can be
the most ageist of all,
because we've had a lifetime
to internalize these messages
and we've never thought to challenge them.
I had to acknowledge it
and stop colluding.
"Senior moment" quips, for example:
I stopped making them when it dawned on me
that when I lost
the car keys in high school,
I didn't call it a "junior moment."
(Laughter)
I stopped blaming
my sore knee on being 64.
My other knee doesn't hurt,
and it's just as old.
(Laughter)
(Applause)
We are all worried about
some aspect of getting older,
whether running out of money,
getting sick, ending up alone,
and those fears are legitimate and real.
But what never dawns on most of us
is that the experience of reaching old age
can be better or worse
depending on the culture
in which it takes place.
It is not having a vagina
that makes life harder for women.
It's sexism.
(Applause)
It's not loving a man that makes
life harder for gay guys.
It's homophobia.
And it is not the passage of time
that makes getting older
so much harder than it has to be.
It is ageism.
When labels are hard to read
or there's no handrail
or we can't open the damn jar,
we blame ourselves,
our failure to age successfully,
instead of the ageism that makes
those natural transitions shameful
and the discrimination that makes
those barriers acceptable.
You can't make money off satisfaction,
but shame and fear create markets,
and capitalism always needs new markets.
Who says wrinkles are ugly?
The multi-billion-dollar
skin care industry.
Who says perimenopause and low T
and mild cognitive impairment
are medical conditions?
The trillion-dollar
pharmaceutical industry.
(Cheers)
The more clearly we see
these forces at work,
the easier it is to come up
with alternative, more positive
and more accurate narratives.
Aging is not a problem to be fixed
or a disease to be cured.
It is a natural, powerful,
lifelong process that unites us all.
Changing the culture is a tall order,
I know that, but culture is fluid.
Look at how much the position
of women has changed in my lifetime
or the incredible strides
that the gay rights movement
has made in just a few decades, right?
(Applause)
Look at gender.
We used to think of it
as a binary, male or female,
and now we understand it's a spectrum.
It is high time to ditch
the old-young binary, too.
There is no line in the sand
between old and young,
after which it's all downhill.
And the longer we wait
to challenge that idea,
the more damage it does
to ourselves and our place in the world,
like in the workforce,
where age discrimination is rampant.
In Silicon Valley, engineers
are getting Botoxed and hair-plugged
before key interviews --
and these are skilled
white men in their 30s,
so imagine the effects
further down the food chain.
(Laughter)
The personal and economic
consequences are devastating.
Not one stereotype about older workers
holds up under scrutiny.
Companies aren't adaptable and creative
because their employees are young;
they're adaptable and creative despite it.
Companies --
(Laughter)
(Applause)
We know that diverse companies
aren't just better places to work;
they work better.
And just like race and sex,
age is a criterion for diversity.
A growing body of fascinating research
shows that attitudes towards aging
affect how our minds and bodies
function at the cellular level.
When we talk to older people
like this (Speaks more loudly)
or call them "sweetie" or "young lady" --
it's called elderspeak --
they appear to instantly age,
walking and talking less competently.
People with more positive
feelings towards aging
walk faster,
they do better on memory tests,
they heal quicker, and they live longer.
Even with brains
full of plaques and tangles,
some people stayed sharp to the end.
What did they have in common?
A sense of purpose.
And what's the biggest obstacle
to having a sense of purpose in late life?
A culture that tells us that getting older
means shuffling offstage.
That's why the World Health
Organization is developing
a global anti-ageism initiative
to extend not just
life span but health span.
Women experience the double whammy
of ageism and sexism,
so we experience aging differently.
There's a double standard
at work here -- shocker --
(Laughter)
the notion that aging enhances men
and devalues women.
Women reinforce this double standard
when we compete to stay young,
another punishing and losing proposition.
Does any woman in this room really believe
that she is a lesser version --
less interesting, less fun in bed,
less valuable --
than the woman she once was?
This discrimination affects our health,
our well-being and our income,
and the effects add up over time.
They are further compounded
by race and by class,
which is why, everywhere in the world,
the poorest of the poor
are old women of color.
What's the takeaway from that map?
By 2050, one out of five of us,
almost two billion people,
will be age 60 and up.
Longevity is a fundamental hallmark
of human progress.
All these older people represent a vast
unprecedented and untapped market.
And yet, capitalism and urbanization
have propelled age bias
into every corner of the globe,
from Switzerland,
where elders fare the best,
to Afghanistan, which sits at the bottom
of the Global AgeWatch Index.
Half of the world's countries
aren't mentioned on that list
because we don't bother to collect data
on millions of people
because they're no longer young.
Almost two-thirds of people
over 60 around the world
say they have trouble
accessing healthcare.
Almost three-quarters say their income
doesn't cover basic services
like food, water, electricity,
and decent housing.
Is this the world we want our children,
who may well live to be a hundred,
to inherit?
Everyone -- all ages,
all genders, all nationalities --
is old or future-old,
and unless we put an end to it,
ageism will oppress us all.
And that makes it a perfect target
for collective advocacy.
Why add another -ism to the list
when so many, racism in particular,
call out for action?
Here's the thing:
we don't have to choose.
When we make the world
a better place to grow old in,
we make it a better place
in which to be from somewhere else,
to have a disability,
to be queer, to be non-rich,
to be non-white.
And when we show up at all ages
for whatever cause matters most to us --
save the whales, save the democracy --
we not only make
that effort more effective,
we dismantle ageism in the process.
Longevity is here to stay.
A movement to end ageism is underway.
I'm in it, and I hope you will join me.
(Applause and cheers)
Thank you. Let's do it! Let's do it!
(Applause)
Let me talk about India
through the evolution of ideas.
Now I believe this is an interesting way of looking at it
because in every society, especially an open democratic society,
it's only when ideas take root that things change.
Slowly ideas lead to ideology,
lead to policies that lead to actions.
In 1930 this country went through a Great Depression,
which led to all the ideas of the state and social security,
and all the other things that happened in Roosevelt's time.
In the 1980s we had the Reagan revolution, which lead to deregulation.
And today, after the global economic crisis,
there was a whole new set of rules
about how the state should intervene.
So ideas change states.
And I looked at India and said,
really there are four kinds of ideas
which really make an impact on India.
The first, to my mind,
is what I call as "the ideas that have arrived."
These ideas have brought together something
which has made India happen the way it is today.
The second set of ideas I call "ideas in progress."
Those are ideas which have been accepted
but not implemented yet.
The third set of ideas are what I call as
"ideas that we argue about" --
those are ideas where we have a fight,
an ideological battle about how to do things.
And the fourth thing, which I believe is most important, is
"the ideas that we need to anticipate."
Because when you are a developing country
in the world where you can see the problems that other countries are having,
you can actually anticipate
what that did and do things very differently.
Now in India's case I believe there are six ideas
which are responsible for where it has come today.
The first is really the notion of people.
In the '60s and '70s
we thought of people as a burden.
We thought of people as a liability.
Today we talk of people as an asset.
We talk of people as human capital.
And I believe this change in the mindset,
of looking at people as something of a burden
to human capital,
has been one of the fundamental changes in the Indian mindset.
And this change in thinking of human capital
is linked to the fact
that India is going through a demographic dividend.
As healthcare improves,
as infant mortality goes down,
fertility rates start dropping. And India is experiencing that.
India is going to have
a lot of young people with a demographic dividend
for the next 30 years.
What is unique about this demographic dividend
is that India will be the only country in the world
to have this demographic dividend.
In other words, it will be the only young country in an aging world.
And this is very important. At the same time
if you peel away the demographic dividend in India,
there are actually two demographic curves.
One is in the south and in the west of India,
which is already going to be fully expensed by 2015,
because in that part of the country, the fertility rate is
almost equal to that of a West European country.
Then there is the whole northern India,
which is going to be the bulk of the future demographic dividend.
But a demographic dividend is only as good
as the investment in your human capital.
Only if the people have education,
they have good health, they have infrastructure,
they have roads to go to work, they have lights to study at night --
only in those cases can you really get the benefit
of a demographic dividend.
In other words, if you don't really invest in the human capital,
the same demographic dividend
can be a demographic disaster.
Therefore India is at a critical point
where either it can leverage its demographic dividend
or it can lead to a demographic disaster.
The second thing in India has been the change in
the role of entrepreneurs.
When India got independence entrepreneurs were seen
as a bad lot, as people who would exploit.
But today, after 60 years, because of the rise of entrepreneurship,
entrepreneurs have become role models,
and they are contributing hugely to the society.
This change has contributed
to the vitality and the whole economy.
The third big thing I believe that has changed India
is our attitude towards the English language.
English language was seen as a language of the imperialists.
But today, with globalization,
with outsourcing, English has become a language of aspiration.
This has made it something that everybody wants to learn.
And the fact that we have English is now becoming
a huge strategic asset.
The next thing is technology.
Forty years back, computers were seen
as something which was forbidding, something which was intimidating,
something that reduced jobs.
Today we live in a country
which sells eight million mobile phones a month,
of which 90 percent of those mobile phones
are prepaid phones
because people don't have credit history.
Forty percent of those prepaid phones
are recharged at less than 20 cents at each recharge.
That is the scale at which
technology has liberated and made it accessible.
And therefore technology has gone
from being seen as something forbidding
and intimidating to something that is empowering.
Twenty years back,
when there was a report on bank computerization,
they didn't name the report as
a report on computers,
they call them as "ledger posting machines."
They didn't want the unions to believe that they were actually computers.
And when they wanted to have more advanced, more powerful computers
they called them "advanced ledger posting machines."
So we have come a long way from those days
where the telephone has become an instrument of empowerment,
and really has changed the way Indians think of technology.
And then I think the other point
is that Indians today are far more
comfortable with globalization.
Again, after having lived for more than 200 years
under the East India Company and under imperial rule,
Indians had a very natural reaction towards globalization
believing it was a form of imperialism.
But today, as Indian companies go abroad,
as Indians come and work all over the world,
Indians have gained a lot more confidence
and have realized that globalization is something they can participate in.
And the fact that the demographics are in our favor,
because we are the only young country in an aging world,
makes globalization all the more attractive to Indians.
And finally, India has had
the deepening of its democracy.
When democracy came to India 60 years back
it was an elite concept.
It was a bunch of people who wanted to bring in democracy
because they wanted to bring in the idea of
universal voting and parliament and constitution and so forth.
But today democracy has become a bottom-up process
where everybody has realized
the benefits of having a voice,
the benefits of being in an open society.
And therefore democracy has become embedded.
I believe these six factors --
the rise of the notion of population as human capital,
the rise of Indian entrepreneurs,
the rise of English as a language of aspiration,
technology as something empowering,
globalization as a positive factor,
and the deepening of democracy -- has contributed
to why India is today growing
at rates it has never seen before.
But having said that,
then we come to what I call as ideas in progress.
Those are the ideas where there is no argument in a society,
but you are not able to implement those things.
And really there are four things here.
One is the question of education.
For some reason, whatever reason -- lack of money,
lack of priorities, because of religion having an older culture --
primary education was never given the focus it required.
But now I believe it's reached a point
where it has become very important.
Unfortunately the government schools don't function,
so children are going to private schools today.
Even in the slums of India
more than 50 percent of urban kids are going into private schools.
So there is a big challenge in getting the schools to work.
But having said that, there is an enormous desire
among everybody, including the poor, to educate their children.
So I believe primary education is an idea
which is arrived but not yet implemented.
Similarly, infrastructure --
for a long time, infrastructure was not a priority.
Those of you who have been to India have seen that.
It's certainly not like China.
But today I believe finally infrastructure is something
which is agreed upon and which people want to implement.
It is reflected in the political statements.
20 years back the political slogan was, "Roti, kapada, makaan,"
which meant, "Food, clothing and shelter."
And today's political slogan is, "Bijli, sadak, pani,"
which means "Electricity, water and roads."
And that is a change in the mindset
where infrastructure is now accepted.
So I do believe this is an idea which has arrived,
but simply not implemented.
The third thing is again cities.
It's because Gandhi believed in villages
and because the British ruled from the cities,
therefore Nehru thought of New Delhi as an un-Indian city.
For a long time we have neglected our cities.
And that is reflected in the kinds of situations that you see.
But today, finally, after economic reforms,
and economic growth,
I think the notion that cities are engines
of economic growth,
cities are engines of creativity,
cities are engines of innovation,
have finally been accepted.
And I think now you're seeing the move towards improving our cities.
Again, an idea which is arrived, but not yet implemented.
The final thing is the notion of India as a single market --
because when you didn't think of India as a market,
you didn't really bother about a single market, because it didn't really matter.
And therefore you had a situation
where every state had its own market for products.
Every province had its own market for agriculture.
Increasingly now the policies of
taxation and infrastructure and all that,
are moving towards creating India as a single market.
So there is a form of internal globalization which is happening,
which is as important as external globalization.
These four factors I believe --
the ones of primary education,
infrastructure, urbanization, and single market --
in my view are ideas in India
which have been accepted, but not implemented.
Then we have what I believe are the ideas in conflict.
The ideas that we argue about.
These are the arguments we have which cause gridlock.
What are those ideas? One is, I think, are ideological issues.
Because of the historical Indian background, in the caste system,
and because of the fact that there have been many people
who have been left out in the cold,
a lot of the politics is about how to make sure
that we'll address that.
And it leads to reservations and other techniques.
It's also related to the way that we subsidize our people,
and all the left and right arguments that we have.
A lot of the Indian problems are related to the ideology
of caste and other things.
This policy is causing gridlock.
This is one of the factors which needs to be resolved.
The second one is the labor policies that we have,
which make it so difficult for
entrepreneurs to create standardized jobs in companies,
that 93 percent of Indian labor
is in the unorganized sector.
They have no benefits: they don't have social security;
they don't have pension; they don't have healthcare; none of those things.
This needs to be fixed because unless you can bring these people
into the formal workforce,
you will end up creating a whole lot of people who are completely disenfranchised.
Therefore we need to create a new set of labor laws,
which are not as onerous as they are today.
At the same time give a policy for a lot more people to be in the formal sector,
and create the jobs for the millions of people that we need to create jobs for.
The third thing is our higher education.
Indian higher education is completely regulated.
It's very difficult to start a private university.
It's very difficult for a foreign university to come to India.
As a result of that our higher education
is simply not keeping pace with India's demands.
That is leading to a lot of problems which we need to address.
But most important I believe
are the ideas we need to anticipate.
Here India can look at what is happening in the west
and elsewhere, and look at what needs to be done.
The first thing is, we're very fortunate
that technology is at a point
where it is much more advanced
than when other countries had the development.
So we can use technology for governance.
We can use technology for direct benefits.
We can use technology for transparency, and many other things.
The second thing is, the health issue.
India has equally horrible
health problems of the higher state of cardiac issue,
the higher state of diabetes, the higher state of obesity.
So there is no point in replacing a set of poor country diseases
with a set of rich country diseases.
Therefore we're to rethink the whole way we look at health.
We really need to put in place a strategy
so that we don't go to the other extreme of health.
Similarly today in the West
you're seeing the problem of entitlement --
the cost of social security, the cost of Medicare, the cost of Medicaid.
Therefore when you are a young country,
again you have a chance to put in place a modern pension system
so that you don't create entitlement problems as you grow old.
And then again, India does not have the luxury
of making its environment dirty,
because it has to marry environment and development.
Just to give an idea, the world has to stabilize
at something like 20 gigatons per year.
On a population of nine billion
our average carbon emission will have to be about two tons per year.
India is already at two tons per year.
But if India grows at something like eight percent,
income per year per person will go to 16 times by 2050.
So we're saying: income growing at 16 times and no growth in carbon.
Therefore we will fundamentally rethink the way we look at the environment,
the way we look at energy,
the way we create whole new paradigms of development.
Now why does this matter to you?
Why does what's happening 10 thousand miles away matter to all of you?
Number one, this matters because
this represents more than a billion people.
A billion people, 1/6th of the world population.
It matters because this is a democracy.
And it is important to prove
that growth and democracy are not incompatible,
that you can have a democracy, that you can have an open society,
and you can have growth.
It's important because if you solve these problems,
you can solve the problems of poverty in the world.
It's important because
you need it to solve the world's environment problems.
If we really want to come to a point,
we really want to put a cap on our carbon emission,
we want to really lower the use of energy --
it has to be solved in countries like India.
You know if you look at the development
in the West over 200 years,
the average growth may have been about two percent.
Here we are talking about countries growing at eight to nine percent.
And that makes a huge difference.
When India was growing at about three, 3.5 percent
and the population was growing at two percent,
its per capita income was doubling every 45 years.
When the economic growth goes to eight percent
and population growth drops to 1.5 percent,
then per capita income is doubling every nine years.
In other words, you're certainly fast-forwarding this whole process
of a billion people going to prosperity.
And you must have a clear strategy
which is important for India and important for the world.
That is why I think all of you
should be equally concerned with it as I am.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
On a warm August morning in Harare,
Farai,
a 24-year-old mother of two,
walks towards a park bench.
She looks miserable and dejected.
Now, on the park bench
sits an 82-year-old woman,
better known to the community
as Grandmother Jack.
Farai hands Grandmother Jack
an envelope from the clinic nurse.
Grandmother Jack invites Farai to sit down
as she opens the envelope and reads.
There's silence for three minutes
or so as she reads.
And after a long pause,
Grandmother Jack takes a deep breath,
looks at Farai and says,
"I'm here for you.
Would you like to share
your story with me?"
Farai begins,
her eyes swelling with tears.
She says, "Grandmother Jack,
I'm HIV-positive.
I've been living with HIV
for the past four years.
My husband left me a year ago.
I have two kids
under the age of five.
I'm unemployed.
I can hardly take care of my children."
Tears are now flowing down her face.
And in response,
Grandmother Jack moves closer,
puts her hand on Farai,
and says, "Farai, it's OK to cry.
You've been through a lot.
Would you like to share more with me?"
And Farai continues.
"In the last three weeks,
I have had recurrent thoughts
of killing myself,
taking my two children with me.
I can't take it anymore.
The clinic nurse sent me to see you."
There's an exchange between the two,
which lasts about 30 minutes.
And finally, Grandmother Jack says,
"Farai,
it seems to me that you have
all the symptoms of kufungisisa."
The word "kufungisisa"
opens up a floodgate of tears.
So, kufungisisa is the local
equivalent of depression
in my country.
It literally means
"thinking too much."
The World Health Organization estimates
that more than 300 million people
globally, today, suffer from depression,
or what in my country
we call kufungisisa.
And the World Health
Organization also tells us
that every 40 seconds,
someone somewhere in the world
commits suicide
because they are unhappy,
largely due to depression or kufungisisa.
And most of these deaths are occurring
in low- and middle-income countries.
In fact,
the World Health Organization
goes as far as to say
that when you look at the age group
between 15 to 29,
a leading cause of death
now is actually suicide.
But there are wider events
that lead to depression
and in some cases, suicide,
such as abuse,
conflict, violence,
isolation, loneliness --
the list is endless.
But one thing that we do know
is that depression can be treated
and suicides averted.
But the problem is
we just don't have enough psychiatrists
or psychologists in the world
to do the job.
In most low- and middle-income
countries, for instance,
the ratio of psychiatrists
to the population
is something like one for every
one and a half million people,
which literally means
that 90 percent of the people
needing mental health services
will not get it.
In my country,
there are 12 psychiatrists,
and I'm one of them,
for a population
of approximately 14 million.
Now, let me just put that into context.
One evening while I was at home,
I get a call from the ER,
or the emergency room,
from a city which is some
200 kilometers away
from where I live.
And the ER doctor says,
"One of your patients,
someone you treated four months ago,
has just taken an overdose,
and they are in the ER department.
Hemodynamically, they seem to be OK,
but they will need
neuropsychiatric evaluation."
Now, I obviously can't get into my car
in the middle of the night
and drive 200 kilometers.
So as best as we could,
over the phone with the ER doctor,
we come up with an assessment.
We ensure that suicidal
observations are in place.
We ensure that we start reviewing
the antidepressants
that this patient has been taking,
and we finally conclude
that as soon as Erica --
that was her name, 26-year-old --
as soon as Erica is ready
to be released from the ER,
she should come
directly to me with her mother,
and I will evaluate
and establish what can be done.
And we assumed that that would
take about a week.
A week passes.
Three weeks pass.
No Erica.
And one day I get a call
from Erica's mother,
and she says,
"Erica committed suicide three days ago.
She hanged herself from the mango tree
in the family garden."
Now, almost like a knee-jerk reaction,
I couldn't help but ask,
"But why didn't you come
to Harare, where I live?
We had agreed that as soon
as you're released from the ER,
you will come to me."
Her response was brief.
"We didn't have the 15 dollars bus fare
to come to Harare."
Now, suicide is not an unusual event
in the world of mental health.
But there was something
about Erica's death
that struck me at the core
of my very being.
That statement from Erica's mother:
"We didn't have 15 dollars bus fare
to come to you,"
made me realize
that it just wasn't going to work,
me expecting people to come to me.
And I got into this state
of soul-searching,
trying to really discover my role
as a psychiatrist in Africa.
And after considerable consultation
and soul-searching,
talking to colleagues, friends and family,
it suddenly dawned on me
that actually, one the most reliable
resources we have in Africa
are grandmothers.
Yes, grandmothers.
And I thought,
grandmothers are in every community.
There are hundreds of them.
And --
(Laughter)
And they don't leave their communities
in search of greener pastures.
(Laughter)
See, the only time they leave
is when they go to a greener
pasture called heaven.
(Laughter)
So I thought, how about
training grandmothers
in evidence-based talk therapy,
which they can deliver on a bench?
Empower them with the skills to listen,
to show empathy,
all of that rooted
in cognitive behavioral therapy;
empower them with the skills
to provide behavior activation,
activity scheduling;
and support them using digital technology.
You know, mobile phone technology.
Pretty much everyone in Africa
has a mobile phone today.
So in 2006,
I started my first group
of grandmothers.
(Applause)
Thank you.
(Applause)
Today, there are hundreds of grandmothers
who are working
in more than 70 communities.
And in the last year alone,
more than 30,000 people received treatment
on the Friendship Bench
from a grandmother
in a community in Zimbabwe.
(Applause)
And recently, we published this work
that is done by these grandmothers
in the Journal of the American
Medical Association.
And --
(Applause)
And our results show
that six months after receiving treatment
from a grandmother,
people were still symptom-free:
no depression,
suicidal ideation completely reduced.
In fact, our results --
this was a clinical trial --
in fact, this clinical trial showed
that grandmothers were more effective
at treating depression
than doctors and --
(Laughter)
(Applause)
And so,
we're now working towards
expanding this program.
There are more than 600 million people
currently aged above 65 in the world.
And by the year 2050,
there will be 1.5 billion people
aged 65 and above.
Imagine if we could create
a global network of grandmothers
in every major city in the world,
who are trained
in evidence-based talk therapy,
supported through digital platforms,
networked.
And they will make a difference
in communities.
They will reduce the treatment gap
for mental, neurological
and substance-use disorders.
Finally,
this is a file photograph
of Grandmother Jack.
So, Farai had six sessions on the bench
with Grandmother Jack.
Today, Farai is employed.
She has her two children at school.
And as for Grandmother Jack,
one morning in February, we expected her
to see her 257th client on the bench.
She didn't show up.
She had gone to a greener
pasture called heaven.
But I believe that Grandmother Jack,
from up there,
she's cheering on
all the other grandmothers --
the increasing number of grandmothers
who are making a difference
in the lives of thousands of people.
And I'm sure she's in awe
when she realizes that something
that she helped to pioneer
is now spreading to other countries,
like Malawi,
the island of Zanzibar
and coming closer to home
here in the Unites States
in the city of New York.
May her soul rest in peace.
Thank you.
(Applause)
(Cheering)
(Applause)
Do you know
how many species of flowering plants there are?
There are a quarter of a million -- at least those are the ones we know about --
a quarter of a million species of flowering plants.
And flowers are a real bugger.
They're really difficult for plants to produce.
They take an enormous amount of energy and a lot of resources.
Why would they go to that bother?
And the answer of course, like so many things in the world,
is sex.
I know what's on your mind when you're looking at these pictures.
And the reason that sexual reproduction is so important --
there are lots of other things that plants can do to reproduce.
You can take cuttings;
they can sort of have sex with themselves;
they can pollinate themselves.
But they really need to spread their genes
to mix with other genes
so that they can adapt to environmental niches.
Evolution works that way.
Now the way that plants transmit that information
is through pollen.
Some of you may have seen some of these pictures before.
As I say, every home should have a scanning electron microscope
to be able to see these.
And there is as many different kinds of pollen
as there are flowering plants.
And that's actually rather useful for forensics and so on.
Most pollen that causes hay fever for us
is from plants that use the wind
to disseminate the pollen,
and that's a very inefficient process,
which is why it gets up our noses so much.
Because you have to chuck out masses and masses of it,
hoping that your sex cells, your male sex cells,
which are held within the pollen,
will somehow reach another flower just by chance.
So all the grasses, which means all of the cereal crops,
and most of the trees
have wind-borne pollen.
But most species
actually use insects to do their bidding,
and that's more intelligent in a way,
because the pollen, they don't need so much of it.
The insects
and other species
can take the pollen,
transfer it directly to where it's required.
So we're aware, obviously, of the relationship
between insects and plants.
There's a symbiotic relationship there,
whether it's flies or birds or bees,
they're getting something in return,
and that something in return is generally nectar.
Sometimes that symbiosis
has led to wonderful adaptations --
the hummingbird hawk-moth
is beautiful in its adaptation.
The plant gets something,
and the hawk-moth spreads the pollen somewhere else.
Plants have evolved
to create little landing strips here and there
for bees that might have lost their way.
There are markings on many plants
that look like other insects.
These are the anthers of a lily,
cleverly done
so that when the unsuspecting insect
lands on it,
the anther flips up and whops it on the back
with a great load of pollen that it then goes to another plant with.
And there's an orchid
that might look to you as if it's got jaws,
and in a way, it has; it forces the insect to crawl out,
getting covered in pollen that it takes somewhere else.
Orchids: there are 20,000, at least,
species of orchids --
amazingly, amazingly diverse.
And they get up to all sorts of tricks.
They have to try and attract pollinators
to do their bidding.
This orchid, known as Darwin's orchid,
because it's one that he studied
and made a wonderful prediction when he saw it --
you can see that there's a very long nectar tube
that descends down
from the orchid.
And basically what the insect has to do --
we're in the middle of the flower --
it has to stick its little proboscis
right into the middle of that
and all the way down that nectar tube
to get to the nectar.
And Darwin said, looking at this flower,
"I guess something has coevolved with this."
And sure enough,
there's the insect.
And I mean, normally it kind of rolls it away,
but in its erect form,
that's what it looks like.
Now you can imagine
that if nectar
is such a valuable thing
and expensive for the plant to produce
and it attracts lots of pollinators,
then, just as in human sex,
people might start to deceive.
They might say, "I've got a bit of nectar. Do you want to come and get it?"
Now this is a plant.
This is a plant here
that insects in South Africa just love,
and they've evolved with a long proboscis
to get the nectar at the bottom.
And this is the mimic.
So this is a plant that is mimicking the first plant.
And here is the long-probosced fly
that has not gotten any nectar from the mimic,
because the mimic doesn't give it any nectar. It thought it would get some.
So not only has the fly
not got the nectar from the mimic plant,
it's also -- if you look very closely
just at the head end, you can see that it's got a bit of pollen
that it would be transmitting to another plant,
if only some botanist hadn't come along
and stuck it to a blue piece of card.
(Laughter)
Now deceit carries on through the plant kingdom.
This flower with its black dots:
they might look like black dots to us,
but if I tell you, to a male insect of the right species,
that looks like two females
who are really, really hot to trot.
(Laughter)
And when the insect gets there and lands on it,
dousing itself in pollen, of course, that it's going to take to another plant,
if you look at the every-home-should-have-one scanning electron microscope picture,
you can see that there are actually some patterning there,
which is three-dimensional.
So it probably even feels good for the insect,
as well as looking good.
And these electron microscope pictures --
here's one of an orchid mimicking an insect --
you can see that different parts of the structure
have different colors and different textures to our eye,
have very, very different textures
to what an insect might perceive.
And this one is evolved to mimic
a glossy metallic surface
you see on some beetles.
And under the scanning electron microscope,
you can see the surface there --
really quite different from the other surfaces we looked at.
Sometimes the whole plant
mimics an insect, even to us.
I mean, I think that looks like some sort of flying animal or beast.
It's a wonderful, amazing thing.
This one's clever. It's called obsidian.
I think of it as insidium sometimes.
To the right species of bee,
this looks like another very aggressive bee,
and it goes and bonks it on the head lots and lots of times to try and drive it away,
and, of course, covers itself with pollen.
The other thing it does
is that this plant mimics another orchid
that has a wonderful store
of food for insects.
And this one doesn't have anything for them.
So it's deceiving on two levels --
fabulous.
(Laughter)
Here we see ylang ylang,
the component of many perfumes.
I actually smelt someone with some on earlier.
And the flowers don't really have to be that gaudy.
They're sending out a fantastic array of scent
to any insect that'll have it.
This one doesn't smell so good.
This is a flower
that really, really smells pretty nasty
and is designed, again, evolved,
to look like carrion.
So flies love this.
They fly in and they pollinate.
This, which is helicodiceros,
is also known as dead horse arum.
I don't know what a dead horse actually smells like,
but this one probably smells pretty much like it.
It's really horrible.
And blowflies just can't help themselves.
They fly into this thing,
and they fly all the way down it.
They lay their eggs in it,
thinking it's a nice bit of carrion,
and not realizing that there's no food for the eggs, that the eggs are going to die,
but the plant, meanwhile, has benefited,
because the bristles release
and the flies disappear
to pollinate the next flower -- fantastic.
Here's arum, arum maculatum,
"lords and ladies," or "cuckoo-pint" in this country.
I photographed this thing last week in Dorset.
This thing heats up
by about 15 degrees above ambient temperature --
amazing.
And if you look down into it,
there's this sort of dam past the spadix,
flies get attracted by the heat --
which is boiling off volatile chemicals, little midges --
and they get trapped underneath in this container.
They drink this fabulous nectar
and then they're all a bit sticky.
At night they get covered in pollen,
which showers down over them,
and then the bristles that we saw above,
they sort of wilt and allow all these midges out, covered in pollen --
fabulous thing.
Now if you think that's fabulous, this is one of my great favorites.
This is the philodendron selloum.
For anyone here from Brazil, you'll know about this plant.
This is the most amazing thing.
That sort of phallic bit there
is about a foot long.
And it does something
that no other plant that I know of does,
and that is that when it flowers --
that's the spadix in the middle there --
for a period of about two days,
it metabolizes in a way
which is rather similar to mammals.
So instead of having starch,
which is the food of plants,
it takes something rather similar to brown fat
and burns it at such a rate
that it's burning fat, metabolizing,
about the rate of a small cat.
And that's twice the energy output, weight for weight,
than a hummingbird --
absolutely astonishing.
This thing does something else which is unusual.
Not only will it raise itself to 115 Fahrenheit,
43 or 44 degrees Centigrade, for two days,
but it keeps constant temperature.
There's a thermoregulation mechanism in there
that keeps constant temperature.
"Now why does it do this," I hear you ask.
Now wouldn't you know it,
there's some beetles that just love to make love at that temperature.
And they get inside, and they get it all on.
(Laughter)
And the plant showers them with pollen,
and off they go and pollinate.
And what a wonderful thing it is.
Now most pollinators
that we think about are insects,
but actually in the tropics,
many birds and butterflies pollinate.
And many of the tropical flowers are red,
and that's because butterflies and birds
see similarly to us, we think,
and can see the color red very well.
But if you look at the spectrum,
birds and us, we see red, green and blue
and see that spectrum.
Insects see green, blue and ultraviolet,
and they see various shades of ultraviolet.
So there's something that goes on off the end there.
"And wouldn't it be great if we could somehow see what that is," I hear you ask.
Well yes we can.
So what is an insect seeing?
Last week I took these pictures of rock rose,
helianthemum, in Dorset.
These are little yellow flowers like we all see,
little yellow flowers all over the place.
And this is what it looks like with visible light.
This is what it looks like if you take out the red.
Most bees don't perceive red.
And then I put some ultraviolet filters on my camera
and took a very, very long exposure
with the particular frequencies of ultraviolet light
and this is what I got.
And that's a real fantastic bull's eye.
Now we don't know
exactly what a bee sees,
any more than you know what I'm seeing
when I call this red.
We can't know what's going on in -- let alone an insect's --
another human being's mind.
But the contrast will look something like that,
so standing out a lot from the background.
Here's another little flower --
different range of ultraviolet frequencies,
different filters
to match the pollinators.
And that's the sort of thing that it would be seeing.
Just in case you think
that all yellow flowers have this property --
no flower was damaged in the process of this shot;
it was just attached to the tripod,
not killed --
then under ultraviolet light,
look at that.
And that could be the basis of a sunscreen
because sunscreens work by absorbing ultraviolet light.
So maybe the chemical in that would be useful.
Finally, there's one of evening primrose
that Bjorn Rorslett from Norway sent me --
fantastic hidden pattern.
And I love the idea of something hidden.
I think there's something poetic here,
that these pictures taken with ultraviolet filter,
the main use of that filter
is for astronomers to take pictures of Venus --
actually the clouds of Venus.
That's the main use of that filter.
Venus, of course, is the god of love and fertility,
which is the flower story.
And just as flowers spend a lot of effort
trying to get pollinators to do their bidding,
they've also somehow managed to persuade us to plant great fields full of them
and give them to each other
at times of birth and death,
and particularly at marriage,
which, when you think of it,
is the moment that encapsulates
the transfer of genetic material
from one organism to another.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
I want to tell you a story about Manson.
Manson was this 28-year-old
interior designer,
a father to a loving daughter,
and a son
who found himself behind bars
due to a broken-down judicial system.
He was framed for a murder
he didn't commit
and was sentenced to the gallows.
There were two victims of this murder --
the victim who actually died in the murder
and Manson, who had been
sentenced to prison
for an offense which he did not commit.
He was locked up in a cell,
eight by seven,
with 13 other grown-up men
for 23 and a half hours a day.
Food was not guaranteed that you'd get.
And I remember yesterday,
as I walked into the room where I was,
I imagined the kind of cell
that Manson would have been living in.
Because the toilet --
The row of the small rooms
that were there were slightly bigger
than the eight-by-seven cell.
But being in that cell
as he awaited the executioner --
because in prison,
he did not have a name --
Manson was known by a number.
He was just a statistic.
He did not know how long he would wait.
The wait could have been a minute,
the executioner could have come
the next minute,
the next day,
or it could have taken 30 years.
The wait had no end.
And in the midst of the excruciating pain,
the mental torture,
the many unanswered questions
that Manson faced,
he knew he was not
going to play the victim.
He refused to play the role of the victim.
He was angry at the justice system
that had put him behind bars.
But he knew the only way
he could change that justice system
or help other people get justice
was not to play the victim.
Change came to Manson
when he decided to embrace forgiveness
for those who had put him in prison.
I speak that as a fact.
Because I know who Manson is.
I am Manson.
My real name is Peter Manson Ouko.
And after my conviction,
after that awakening of forgiveness,
I had this move
to help change the system.
I already decided I was not
going to be a victim anymore.
But how was I going to help
change a system
that was bringing in
younger inmates every day
who deserve to be with their families?
So I started mobilizing my colleagues
in prison, my fellow inmates,
to write letters and memoranda
to the justice system,
to the Judicial Service Commission,
the numerous task forces
that had been set up
in our country, Kenya,
to help change the constitution.
And we decided to grasp at those --
to clutch at those straws,
if I may use that word --
if only to make the justice system work,
and work for all.
Just about the same time,
I met a young university
graduate from the UK,
called Alexander McLean.
Alexander had come in with three or four
of his colleagues from university
in their gap year,
and they wanted to help assist,
set up a library in Kamiti Maximum Prison,
which if you Google,
you will see is written as one
of the 15 worst prisons in the world.
That was then.
But when Alexander came in,
he was a young 20-year-old boy.
And I was on death row at that time.
And we took him under our wing.
It was an honest trust issue.
He trusted us, even though
we were on death row.
And through that trust,
we saw him and his colleagues
from the university
refurbish the library
with the latest technology
and set up the infirmary
to very good standards
so that those of us falling sick in prison
would not necessarily
have to die in indignity.
Having met Alexander,
I had a chance,
and he gave me the opportunity
and the support,
to enroll for a university degree
at the University of London.
Just like Mandela
studied from South Africa,
I had a chance to study
at Kamiti Maximum Security Prison.
And two years later,
I became the first graduate of the program
from the University of London
from within the prison system.
Having graduated, what happened next --
(Applause)
Thank you.
(Applause)
Having graduated,
now I felt empowered.
I was not going to play
the helpless victim.
But I felt empowered
not only to assist myself,
to prosecute my own case,
but also to assist the other inmates
who are suffering the similar injustices
that have just been spoken about here.
So I started writing
legal briefs for them.
With my other colleagues in prison,
we did as much as we could.
That wasn't enough.
Alexander McLean
and his team
at the African Prisons Project
decided to support more inmates.
And as I'm speaking to you today,
there are 63 inmates and staff
in the Kenya Prison Service
studying law at the University of London
through distance learning.
(Applause)
These are changemakers
who are being motivated
not only to assist
the most indolent in society,
but also to help the inmates
and others get access to justice.
Down there in my prison cell,
something kept stirring me.
The words of Martin Luther King
kept hitting me.
And he was always telling me,
"Pete, if you can't fly,
you can run.
And if you can't run,
you can walk.
But if you can't walk,
then you can crawl.
But whatever it is, whatever it takes,
just keep on moving."
And so I had this urge to keep moving.
I still have this urge
to keep moving in whatever I do.
Because I feel the only way
we can change our society,
the only way we can change
the justice system --
which has really improved
in our country --
is to help get the systems right.
So, on 26th October last year,
after 18 years in prison,
I walked out of prison
on presidential pardon.
I'm now focused on helping APP --
the African Prisons Project --
achieve its mandate
of training and setting up
the first law school
and legal college behind bars.
Where we are going to train --
(Applause)
Where we are going to train
inmates and staff
not only to assist their fellow inmates,
but to assist the entire
wider society of the poor
who cannot access legal justice.
So as I speak before you today,
I stand here in the full knowledge
that we can all reexamine ourselves,
we can all reexamine our situations,
we can all reexamine our circumstances
and not play the victim narrative.
The victim narrative
will not take us anywhere.
I was behind bars, yeah.
But I never felt and I was not a prisoner.
The basic thing I got to learn
was that if I thought,
and if you think, you can,
you will.
But if you sit thinking that you can't,
you won't.
It's as simple as that.
And so I'm encouraged
by the peaceful revolutionaries
I've heard on this stage.
The world needs you now,
the world needs you today.
And as I finish my talk,
I'd just like to ask
each and every single one of you here,
wonderful thinkers,
changemakers, innovators,
the wonderful global citizens
we have at TED,
just remember the words
of Martin Luther King.
Let them continue ringing
in your heart and your life.
Whatever it is,
wherever you are,
whatever it takes,
keep on moving.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Thank you.
(Applause)
"All I wanted was
a much-deserved promotion,
and he told me to 'Get up on the desk
and spread 'em.'"
"All the men in my office
wrote down on a piece of paper
the sexual favors
that I could do for them.
All I had asked for
was an office with a window."
"I asked for his advice about how
I could get a bill out of committee;
he asked me if I brought my kneepads."
Those are just a few
of the horrific stories
that I heard from women
over the last year,
as I've been investigating
workplace sexual harassment.
And what I found out
is that it's an epidemic across the world.
It's a horrifying reality
for millions of women,
when all they want to do every day
is go to work.
Sexual harassment doesn't discriminate.
You can wear a skirt,
hospital scrubs,
army fatigues.
You can be young or old,
married or single,
black or white.
You can be a Republican,
a Democrat or an Independent.
I heard from so many women:
police officers,
members of our military,
financial assistants,
actors, engineers, lawyers,
bankers, accountants, teachers ...
journalists.
Sexual harassment, it turns out,
is not about sex.
It's about power,
and about what somebody does to you
to try and take away your power.
And I'm here today
to encourage you to know
that you can take that power back.
(Applause)
On July 6, 2016,
I jumped off a cliff all by myself.
It was the scariest moment of my life;
an excruciating choice to make.
I fell into an abyss all alone,
not knowing what would be below.
But then, something miraculous
started to happen.
Thousands of women
started reaching out to me
to share their own stories
of pain and agony and shame.
They told me that I became their voice --
they were voiceless.
And suddenly, I realized
that even in the 21st century,
every woman still has a story.
Like Joyce,
a flight attendant supervisor
whose boss, in meetings every day,
would tell her about the porn
that he'd watched the night before
while drawing penises on his notepad.
She went to complain.
She was called "crazy" and fired.
Like Joanne, Wall Street banker.
Her male colleagues would call her
that vile c-word every day.
She complained --
labeled a troublemaker,
never to do another
Wall Street deal again.
Like Elizabeth, an army officer.
Her male subordinates would wave
one-dollar bills in her face,
and say, "Dance for me!"
And when she went to complain to a major,
he said, "What? Only one dollar?
You're worth at least five or ten!"
After reading,
replying to all
and crying over all of these emails,
I realized I had so much work to do.
Here are the startling facts:
one in three women -- that we know of --
have been sexually harassed
in the workplace.
Seventy-one percent of those incidences
never get reported.
Why?
Because when women come forward,
they're still called liars
and troublemakers
and demeaned and trashed
and demoted and blacklisted
and fired.
Reporting sexual harassment can be,
in many cases, career-ending.
Of all the women that reached out to me,
almost none are still today working
in their chosen profession,
and that is outrageous.
I, too, was silent in the beginning.
It happened to me at the end
of my year as Miss America,
when I was meeting with
a very high-ranking TV executive
in New York City.
I thought he was helping me
throughout the day,
making a lot of phone calls.
We went to dinner,
and in the back seat of a car,
he suddenly lunged on top of me
and stuck his tongue down my throat.
I didn't realize that to "get
into the business" -- silly me --
he also intended to get into my pants.
And just a week later,
when I was in Los Angeles
meeting with a high-ranking publicist,
it happened again.
Again, in a car.
And he took my neck in his hand,
and he shoved my head
so hard into his crotch,
I couldn't breathe.
These are the events that suck the life
out of all of your self-confidence.
These are the events that, until recently,
I didn't even call assault.
And this is why we have
so much work to do.
After my year as Miss America,
I continued to meet
a lot of well-known people,
including Donald Trump.
When this picture was taken in 1988,
nobody could have ever predicted
where we'd be today.
(Laughter)
Me, fighting to end sexual
harassment in the workplace;
he, president of the United States
in spite of it.
And shortly thereafter, I got
my first gig in television news
in Richmond, Virginia.
Check out that confident smile
with the bright pink jacket.
Not so much the hair.
(Laughter)
I was working so hard to prove
that blondes have a lot of brains.
But ironically, one of the first
stories I covered
was the Anita Hill hearings
in Washington, DC.
And shortly thereafter,
I, too, was sexually harassed
in the workplace.
I was covering a story in rural Virginia,
and when we got back into the car,
my cameraman started saying to me,
wondering how much I had enjoyed
when he touched my breasts
when he put the microphone on me.
And it went downhill from there.
I was bracing myself
against the passenger door --
this was before cellphones.
I was petrified.
I actually envisioned myself
rolling outside of that door
as the car was going 50 miles per hour
like I'd seen in the movies,
and wondering how much it would hurt.
When the story about
Harvey Weinstein came to light --
one the most well-known
movie moguls in all of Hollywood --
the allegations were horrific.
But so many women came forward,
and it made me realize
what I had done meant something.
(Applause)
He had such a lame excuse.
He said he was a product
of the '60s and '70s,
and that that was the culture then.
Yeah, that was the culture then,
and unfortunately, it still is.
Why?
Because of all the myths
that are still associated
with sexual harassment.
"Women should just take another job
and find another career."
Yeah, right.
Tell that to the single mom
working two jobs,
trying to make ends meet,
who's also being sexually harassed.
"Women --
they bring it on themselves."
By the clothes that we wear
and the makeup that we put on.
Yeah, I guess those hoodies
that Uber engineers wear in Silicon Valley
are just so provocative.
"Women make it up."
Yeah, because it's so fun and rewarding
to be demeaned and taken down.
I would know.
"Women bring these claims
because they want to be famous and rich."
Our own president said that.
I bet Taylor Swift,
one of the most well-known
and richest singers in the world,
didn't need more money or fame
when she came forward
with her groping case
for one dollar.
And I'm so glad she did.
Breaking news:
the untold story about women
and sexual harassment in the workplace:
women just want a safe, welcoming
and harass-free environment.
That's it.
(Applause)
So how do we go about
getting our power back?
I have three solutions.
Number one:
we need to turn bystanders
and enablers into allies.
Ninety-eight percent of United States
corporations right now
have sexual harassment training policies.
Seventy percent have prevention programs.
But still, overwhelmingly,
bystanders and witnesses
don't come forward.
In 2016,
the Harvard Business Review
called it the "bystander effect."
And yet -- remember 9/11.
Millions of times we've heard,
"If you see something,
say something."
Imagine how impactful that would be
if we carried that through
to bystanders in the workplace
regarding sexual harassment --
to recognize and interrupt
these incidences;
to confront the perpetrators
to their face;
to help and protect the victims.
This is my shout-out to men:
we need you in this fight.
And to women, too --
enablers to allies.
Number two:
change the laws.
How many of you out there know
whether or not you have
a forced arbitration clause
in your employment contract?
Not a lot of hands.
And if you don't know, you should,
and here's why.
TIME Magazine calls it,
right there on the screen,
"The teeny tiny little print in contracts
that keeps sexual
harassment claims unheard."
Here's what it is.
Forced arbitration takes away
your Seventh Amendment right
to an open jury process.
It's secret.
You don't get the same
witnesses or depositions.
In many cases, the company
picks the arbitrator for you.
There are no appeals,
and only 20 percent of the time
does the employee win.
But again, it's secret,
so nobody ever knows what happened to you.
This is why I've been
working so diligently
on Capitol Hill in Washington, DC
to change the laws.
And here's what I tell the Senators:
sexual harassment is apolitical.
Before somebody harasses you,
they don't ask you if you're
a Republican or Democrat first.
They just do it.
And this is why we should all care.
Number three:
be fierce.
It starts when we stand tall,
and we build that self-confidence.
And we stand up and we speak up,
and we tell the world what happened to us.
I know it's scary,
but let's do it for our kids.
Let's stop this for the next generations.
I know that I did it for my children.
They were paramount in my decision-making
about whether or not I would come forward.
My beautiful children,
my 12-year-old son, Christian,
my 14-year-old daughter, Kaia.
And boy, did I underestimate them.
The first day of school last year
happened to be the day
my resolution was announced,
and I was so anxious
about what they would face.
My daughter came home
from school and she said,
"Mommy, so many people asked me
what happened to you over the summer."
Then she looked at me in the eyes
and she said, "And mommy,
I was so proud
to say that you were my mom."
And two weeks later,
when she finally found the courage
to stand up to two kids
who had been making her life miserable,
she came home to me and she said,
"Mommy, I found the courage to do it
because I saw you do it."
(Applause)
You see, giving the gift
of courage is contagious.
And I hope that my journey
has inspired you,
because right now, it's the tipping point.
We are watching history happen.
More and more women
are coming forward and saying,
"Enough is enough."
(Applause)
Here's my one last plea to companies.
Let's hire back all those women
whose careers were lost
because of some random jerk.
Because here's what I know about women:
we will not longer be underestimated,
intimidated or set back;
we will not be silenced
by the ways of the establishment
or the relics of the past.
No.
We will stand up and speak up
and have our voices heard.
We will be the women we were meant to be.
And above all,
we will always be fierce.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Do you ever think about how important
the oceans are in our daily lives?
The oceans cover two-thirds of our planet.
They provide half the oxygen we breathe.
They moderate our climate.
And they provide jobs
and medicine and food
including 20 percent of protein
to feed the entire world population.
People used to think
that the oceans were so vast
that they wouldn't be affected
by human activities.
Well today I'm going to tell you
about a serious reality
that is changing our oceans
called ocean acidification,
or the evil twin of climate change.
Did you know that the oceans have absorbed
25 percent of all of the carbon dioxide
that we have emitted to the atmosphere?
Now this is just another great service
provided by the oceans
since carbon dioxide
is one of the greenhouse gases
that's causing climate change.
But as we keep pumping
more and more and more
carbon dioxide into the atmosphere
more is dissolving into the oceans.
And this is what's changing
our ocean chemistry.
When carbon dioxide dissolves in seawater,
it undergoes a number
of chemical reactions.
Now lucky for you,
I don't have time to get into
the details of the chemistry for today.
But I'll tell you as more
carbon dioxide enters the ocean,
the seawater pH goes down.
And this basically means that there
is an increase in ocean acidity.
And this whole process
is called ocean acidification.
And it's happening
alongside climate change.
Scientists have been monitoring
ocean acidification for over two decades.
This figure is an important
time series in Hawaii,
and the top line shows steadily increasing
concentrations of carbon dioxide,
or CO2 gas, in the atmosphere.
And this is directly as a result
of human activities.
The line underneath shows the increasing
concentrations of carbon dioxide
that is dissolved
in the surface of the ocean
which you can see is increasing
at the same rate
as carbon dioxide in the atmosphere
since measurements began.
The line on the bottom shows
then shows the change in chemistry.
As more carbon dioxide
has entered the ocean,
the seawater pH has gone down,
which basically means there has been
an increase in ocean acidity.
Now in Ireland, scientists are also
monitoring ocean acidification --
scientists at the Marine
Institute and NUI Galway.
And we, too, are seeing
acidification at the same rate
as these main ocean time-series
sites around the world.
So it's happening right at our doorstep.
Now I'd like to give you an example
of just how we collect our data
to monitor a changing ocean.
Firstly we collect a lot of our samples
in the middle of winter.
So as you can imagine,
in the North Atlantic
we get hit with some seriously
stormy conditions --
so not for any of you
who get a little motion sickness,
but we are collecting
some very valuable data.
So we lower this instrument
over the side of the ship,
and there are sensors
that are mounted on the bottom
that can tell us information about
the surrounding water,
such as temperature
or dissolved oxygen.
And then we can collect our seawater
samples in these large bottles.
So we start at the bottom,
which can be over four kilometers deep
just off our continental shelf,
and we take samples at regular intervals
right up to the surface.
We take the seawater back on the deck,
and then we can either
analyze them on the ship
or back in the laboratory
for the different chemicals parameters.
But why should we care?
How is ocean acidification
going to affect all of us?
Well, here are the worrying facts.
There has already been an increase
in ocean acidity of 26 percent
since pre-industrial times,
which is directly due to human activities.
Unless we can start slowing down
our carbon dioxide emissions,
we're expecting an increase
in ocean acidity of 170 percent
by the end of this century.
I mean this is within
our children's lifetime.
This rate of acidification
is 10 times faster
than any acidification in our oceans
for over 55 million years.
So our marine life have never,
ever experienced
such a fast rate of change before.
So we literally could not know
how they're going to cope.
Now there was a natural acidification
event millions of years ago,
which was much slower
than what we're seeing today.
And this coincided with a mass extinction
of many marine species.
So is that what we're headed for?
Well, maybe.
Studies are showing
some species are actually doing quite well
but many are showing a negative response.
One of the big concerns is
as ocean acidity increases,
the concentration of carbonate
ions in seawater decrease.
Now these ions are basically
the building blocks
for many marine species
to make their shells,
for example crabs or mussels, oysters.
Another example are corals.
They also need these carbonate
ions in seawater
to make their coral structure
in order to build coral reefs.
As ocean acidity increases
and the concentration
of carbonate ions decrease,
these species first find it more difficult
to make their shells.
And at even even lower levels,
they can actually begin to dissolve.
This here is a pteropod,
it's called a sea butterfly.
And it's an important food source
in the ocean for many species,
from krill to salmon right up to whales.
The shell of the pteropod
was placed into seawater
at a pH that we're expecting
by the end of this century.
After only 45 days
at this very realistic pH,
you can see the shell
has almost completely dissolved.
So ocean acidification could affect
right up through the food chain --
and right onto our dinner plates.
I mean who here
likes shellfish? Or salmon?
Or many other fish species
whose food source
in the ocean could be affected?
These are cold-water corals.
And did you know we actually have
cold-water corals in Irish waters,
just off our continental shelf?
And they support rich biodiversity,
including some very important fisheries.
It's projected that
by the end of this century,
70 percent of all known cold-water corals
in the entire ocean
will be surrounded by seawater
that is dissolving their coral structure.
The last example I have
are these healthy tropical corals.
They were placed in seawater at a pH
we're expecting by the year 2100.
After six months, the coral
has almost completely dissolved.
Now coral reefs support
25 percent of all marine life
in the entire ocean.
All marine life.
So you can see: ocean
acidification is a global threat.
I have an eight-month-old baby boy.
Unless we start now to slow this down,
I dread to think what our oceans
will look like when he's a grown man.
We will see acidification.
We have already put too much
carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.
But we can slow this down.
We can prevent the worst-case scenario.
The only way of doing that
is by reducing our
carbon dioxide emissions.
This is important for both you and I,
for industry, for governments.
We need to work together,
slow down global warming
slow down ocean acidification
and help to maintain a healthy ocean
and a healthy planet
for our generation
and for generations to come.
(Applause)
So there's a lot of valid
concern these days
that our technology is getting so smart
that we've put ourselves
on the path to a jobless future.
And I think the example
of a self-driving car
is actually the easiest one to see.
So these are going to be fantastic
for all kinds of different reasons.
But did you know that "driver"
is actually the most common job
in 29 of the 50 US states?
What's going to happen to these jobs
when we're no longer driving our cars
or cooking our food
or even diagnosing our own diseases?
Well, a recent study
from Forrester Research
goes so far to predict
that 25 million jobs
might disappear over the next 10 years.
To put that in perspective,
that's three times as many jobs lost
in the aftermath of the financial crisis.
And it's not just blue-collar jobs
that are at risk.
On Wall Street and across Silicon Valley,
we are seeing tremendous gains
in the quality of analysis
and decision-making
because of machine learning.
So even the smartest, highest-paid people
will be affected by this change.
What's clear is that no matter
what your job is,
at least some, if not all of your work,
is going to be done by a robot
or software in the next few years.
And that's exactly why people
like Mark Zuckerberg and Bill Gates
are talking about the need for
government-funded minimum income levels.
But if our politicians can't agree
on things like health care
or even school lunches,
I just don't see a path
where they'll find consensus
on something as big and as expensive
as universal basic life income.
Instead, I think the response
needs to be led by us in industry.
We have to recognize
the change that's ahead of us
and start to design the new kinds of jobs
that will still be relevant
in the age of robotics.
The good news is that we have
faced down and recovered
two mass extinctions of jobs before.
From 1870 to 1970,
the percent of American workers
based on farms fell by 90 percent,
and then again from 1950 to 2010,
the percent of Americans
working in factories
fell by 75 percent.
The challenge we face this time,
however, is one of time.
We had a hundred years
to move from farms to factories,
and then 60 years to fully build out
a service economy.
The rate of change today
suggests that we may only have
10 or 15 years to adjust,
and if we don't react fast enough,
that means by the time
today's elementary-school students
are college-aged,
we could be living
in a world that's robotic,
largely unemployed and stuck
in kind of un-great depression.
But I don't think it has to be this way.
You see, I work in innovation,
and part of my job is to shape how
large companies apply new technologies.
Certainly some of these technologies
are even specifically designed
to replace human workers.
But I believe that if we start
taking steps right now
to change the nature of work,
we can not only create environments
where people love coming to work
but also generate
the innovation that we need
to replace the millions of jobs
that will be lost to technology.
I believe that the key
to preventing our jobless future
is to rediscover what makes us human,
and to create a new generation
of human-centered jobs
that allow us to unlock
the hidden talents and passions
that we carry with us every day.
But first, I think
it's important to recognize
that we brought this problem on ourselves.
And it's not just because, you know,
we are the one building the robots.
But even though most jobs
left the factory decades ago,
we still hold on to this factory mindset
of standardization and de-skilling.
We still define jobs
around procedural tasks
and then pay people for the number
of hours that they perform these tasks.
We've created narrow job definitions
like cashier, loan processor
or taxi driver
and then asked people
to form entire careers
around these singular tasks.
These choices have left us with
actually two dangerous side effects.
The first is that these
narrowly defined jobs
will be the first
to be displaced by robots,
because single-task robots
are just the easiest kinds to build.
But second, we have accidentally made it
so that millions of workers
around the world
have unbelievably boring working lives.
(Laughter)
Let's take the example
of a call center agent.
Over the last few decades,
we brag about lower operating costs
because we've taken most
of the need for brainpower
out of the person
and put it into the system.
For most of their day,
they click on screens,
they read scripts.
They act more like machines than humans.
And unfortunately,
over the next few years,
as our technology gets more advanced,
they, along with people
like clerks and bookkeepers,
will see the vast majority
of their work disappear.
To counteract this,
we have to start creating new jobs
that are less centered
on the tasks that a person does
and more focused on the skills
that a person brings to work.
For example, robots are great
at repetitive and constrained work,
but human beings have an amazing ability
to bring together
capability with creativity
when faced with problems
that we've never seen before.
It's when every day
brings a little bit of a surprise
that we have designed work for humans
and not for robots.
Our entrepreneurs and engineers
already live in this world,
but so do our nurses and our plumbers
and our therapists.
You know, it's the nature
of too many companies and organizations
to just ask people to come to work
and do your job.
But if you work is better done by a robot,
or your decisions better made by an AI,
what are you supposed to be doing?
Well, I think for the manager,
we need to realistically think about
the tasks that will be disappearing
over the next few years
and start planning for more meaningful,
more valuable work that should replace it.
We need to create environments
where both human beings and robots thrive.
I say, let's give more work to the robots,
and let's start with the work
that we absolutely hate doing.
Here, robot,
process this painfully idiotic report.
(Laughter)
And move this box. Thank you.
(Laughter)
And for the human beings,
we should follow the advice from Harry
Davis at the University of Chicago.
He says we have to make it so that people
don't leave too much of themselves
in the trunk of their car.
I mean, human beings
are amazing on weekends.
Think about the people that you know
and what they do on Saturdays.
They're artists, carpenters,
chefs and athletes.
But on Monday, they're back
to being Junior HR Specialist
and Systems Analyst 3.
(Laughter)
You know, these narrow job titles
not only sound boring,
but they're actually
a subtle encouragement
for people to make narrow
and boring job contributions.
But I've seen firsthand
that when you invite people to be more,
they can amaze us
with how much more they can be.
A few years ago,
I was working at a large bank
that was trying to bring more innovation
into its company culture.
So my team and I designed
a prototyping contest
that invited anyone to build
anything that they wanted.
We were actually trying to figure out
whether or not
the primary limiter to innovation
was a lack of ideas or a lack of talent,
and it turns out it was neither one.
It was an empowerment problem.
And the results
of the program were amazing.
We started by inviting
people to reenvision
what it is they could bring to a team.
This contest was not only a chance
to build anything that you wanted
but also be anything that you wanted.
And when people were no longer
limited by their day-to-day job titles,
they felt free to bring all kinds
of different skills and talents
to the problems
that they were trying to solve.
We saw technology people being designers,
marketing people being architects,
and even finance people showing off
their ability to write jokes.
(Laughter)
We ran this program twice,
and each time more than 400 people
brought their unexpected talents to work
and solved problems that they had been
wanting to solve for years.
Collectively, they created
millions of dollars of value,
building things like a better
touch-tone system for call centers,
easier desktop tools for branches
and even a thank you card system
that has become a cornerstone
of the employee working experience.
Over the course of the eight weeks,
people flexed muscles that they never
dreamed of using at work.
People learned new skills,
they met new people,
and at the end, somebody
pulled me aside and said,
"I have to tell you,
the last few weeks has been
one of the most intense,
hardest working experiences
of my entire life,
but not one second of it felt like work."
And that's the key.
For those few weeks, people
got to be creators and innovators.
They had been dreaming of solutions
to problems that had been
bugging them for years,
and this was a chance to turn
those dreams into a reality.
And that dreaming is an important part
of what separates us from machines.
For now, our machines
do not get frustrated,
they do not get annoyed,
and they certainly don't imagine.
But we, as human beings --
we feel pain,
we get frustrated.
And it's when we're most annoyed
and most curious
that we're motivated to dig
into a problem and create change.
Our imaginations are the birthplace
of new products, new services,
and even new industries.
I believe that the jobs of the future
will come from the minds of people
who today we call
analysts and specialists,
but only if we give them the freedom
and protection that they need to grow
into becoming explorers and inventors.
If we really want to robot-proof our jobs,
we, as leaders, need
to get out of the mindset
of telling people what to do
and instead start asking them
what problems they're inspired to solve
and what talents
they want to bring to work.
Because when you can bring
your Saturday self to work on Wednesdays,
you'll look forward to Mondays more,
and those feelings
that we have about Mondays
are part of what makes us human.
And as we redesign work
for an era of intelligent machines,
I invite you all to work alongside me
to bring more humanity
to our working lives.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Chris Anderson: So two months ago,
something crazy happened.
Can you talk us through this, because
this caught so many people's attention?
Gwynne Shotwell: I'll stay quiet
for the beginning,
and then I'll start talking.
(Video) Voices: Five, four,
three, two, one.
(Cheering)
Woman: Liftoff. Go Falcon Heavy.
GS: So this was such
an important moment for SpaceX.
With the Falcon 9
and now the Falcon Heavy,
we can launch into orbit
any payload that has previously
been conceived or is conceived right now.
We've got a couple of launches
of Falcon Heavy later this year,
so this had to go right.
It was the first time we flew it,
and the star of the show, of course,
brother and sister side boosters landing.
I was excited.
(Laughter)
Thanking my team.
By the way, there's maybe
a thousand people
standing around me right there.
And Starman.
Starman did not steal the show, though --
the boosters did.
CA: (Laughter)
CA: There had to be some payload --
why not put a Tesla into space?
GS: Exactly. It was perfect.
CA: Gwynne, let's wind the clock back.
I mean, how did you end up an engineer
and President of SpaceX?
Were you supernerdy as a girl?
GS: I don't think I was nerdy,
but I was definitely doing the things
that the girls weren't doing.
I asked my mom, who was an artist,
when I was in third grade,
how a car worked,
so she had no idea so she gave me
a book, and I read it,
and sure enough, my first job
out of my mechanical engineering degree
was with Chrysler Motors
in the automotive industry.
But I actually got into engineering
not because of that book
but because my mom took me
to a Society of Women Engineers event,
and I fell in love with
the mechanical engineer that spoke.
She was doing really critical work,
and I loved her suit.
(Laughter)
And that's what a 15-year-old
girl connects with.
And I used to shy away
from telling that story,
but if that's what caused me
to be an engineer --
hey, I think we should talk about that.
CA: Sixteen years ago, you became
employee number seven at SpaceX,
and then over the next years,
you somehow built a multi-billion-dollar
relationship with NASA,
despite the fact that SpaceX's
first three launches blew up.
I mean, how on earth did you do that?
GS: So actually, selling rockets
is all about relationships
and making a connection
with these customers.
When you don't have a rocket to sell,
what's really important
is selling your team,
selling the business savvy of your CEO --
that's not really hard
to sell these days --
and basically, making sure
that any technical issue that they have
or any concern,
you can address right away.
So I think it was helpful
for me to be an engineer.
I think it was helpful to my role
of running sales for Elon.
CA: And currently,
a big focus of the company
is, I guess, kind of a race with Boeing
to be the first to provide
the service to NASA
of actually putting humans into orbit.
Safety considerations obviously
come to the fore, here.
How are you sleeping?
GS: I actually sleep really well.
I'm a good sleeper, that's my best thing.
But I think the days leading up
to our flying crew
will probably be a little sleepless.
But really, fundamentally,
safety comes in the design
of the system that you're going
to fly people on,
and so we've been working for years,
actually, almost a decade,
on this technology.
We're taking the Dragon cargo spaceship
and we're upgrading it
to be able to carry crew.
And as I said, we've been
engineering in these safety systems
for quite some time.
CA: So isn't it that there's one system
that actually allows instant escape
if there's a problem.
GS: That's right. It's called
the launch escape system.
CA: I think we have that. Let's show that.
GS: We've got a video
of a test that we ran in 2015.
So this simulated having
a really bad day on the pad.
Basically, you want the capsule
to get out of Dodge.
You want it to get away from the rocket
that had a bad day right below it.
This is if there was an issue on the pad.
We also will be doing
another demonstration later this year
on if we have an issue
with the rocket during flight.
CA: And those rockets have another
potential function as well, eventually.
GS: Yeah, so the launch escape system
for Dragon is pretty unique.
It's an integrated launch escape system.
It's basically a pusher,
so the propellant system and the thrusters
are integrated into the capsule,
and so if it detects a rocket problem,
it pushes the capsule away.
Capsule safety systems in the past
have been like tractor pullers,
and the reason we didn't want to do that
is that puller needs to come off before
you can safely reenter that capsule,
so we wanted to eliminate, in design,
that possibility of failure.
CA: I mean, SpaceX has made
the regular reusability of rockets
seem almost routine,
which means you've done something
that no national
space program, for example,
has been able to achieve.
How was that possible?
GS: I think there's a couple of things --
there's a million things, actually --
that have allowed SpaceX to be successful.
The first is that we're kind of standing
on the shoulders of giants. Right?
We got to look at the rocket industry
and the developments to date,
and we got to pick the best ideas,
leverage them.
We also didn't have technology
that we had to include
in our vehicle systems.
So we didn't have to design
around legacy components
that maybe weren't the most reliable
or were particularly expensive,
so we really were able to let physics
drive the design of these systems.
CA: I mean, there are other programs
started from scratch.
That last phrase you said there,
you let physics drive the design,
what's an example of that?
GS: There's hundreds of examples,
actually, of that,
but basically, we got to construct
the vehicle design
from, really, a clean sheet of paper,
and we got to make decisions
that we wanted to make.
The tank architecture --
it's a common dome design.
Basically it's like two beer cans
stacked together,
one full of liquid oxygen,
one full of RP,
and that basically saved weight.
It allowed us to basically take
more payload for the same design.
One of the other elements of the vehicle
that we're flying right now
is we do use densified
liquid oxygen and densified RP,
so it's ultracold,
and it allows you to pack
more propellent into the vehicle.
It is done elsewhere,
probably not to the degree that we do it,
but it adds a lot
of margin to the vehicle,
which obviously adds reliability.
CA: Gwynne, you became President
of SpaceX 10 years ago, I think.
What's it been like to work
so closely with Elon Musk?
GS: So I love working for Elon.
I've been doing it for 16 years
this year, actually.
I don't think I'm dumb enough
to do something for 16 years
that I don't like doing.
He's funny
and fundamentally without
him saying anything
he drives you to do your best work.
He doesn't have to say a word.
You just want to do great work.
CA: You might be the person
best placed to answer this question,
which has puzzled me,
which is to shed light
on this strange unit of time
called "Elon time."
For example, last year,
I asked Elon, you know,
when Tesla would
auto-drive across America,
and he said by last December,
which is definitely true,
if you take Elon time into account.
So what's the conversion ratio
between Elon time and real time?
(Laughter)
GS: You put me
in a unique position, Chris.
Thanks for that.
There's no question that Elon
is very aggressive on his timelines,
but frankly, that drives us
to do things better and faster.
I think all the time
and all the money in the world
does not yield the best solution,
and so putting that pressure on the team
to move quickly is really important.
CA: It feels like you play
kind of a key intermediary role here.
I mean, he sets these crazy goals
that have their impact,
but, in other circumstances,
might blow up a team
or set impossible expectations.
It feels like you've found a way
of saying, "Yes, Elon,"
and then making it happen
in a way that is acceptable
both to him and to your company,
to your employees.
GS: There is two really important
realizations for that.
First of all, when Elon says something,
you have to pause
and not immediately blurt out,
"Well, that's impossible,"
or, "There's no way we're going
to do that. I don't know how."
So you zip it, and you think about it,
and you find ways to get that done.
And the other thing I realized,
and it made my job satisfaction
substantially harder.
So I always felt like my job
was to take these ideas
and kind of turn them into company goals,
make them achievable,
and kind of roll the company over
from this steep slope, get it comfortable.
And I noticed every time
I felt like we were there,
we were rolling over,
people were getting comfortable,
Elon would throw something out there,
and all of a sudden, we're not comfortable
and we're climbing that steep slope again.
But then once I realized
that that's his job,
and my job is to get the company
close to comfortable
so he can push again
and put us back on that slope,
then I started liking my job a lot more,
instead of always being frustrated.
CA: So if I estimated
that the conversation ratio
for Elon time to your time is about 2x,
am I a long way out there?
GS: That's not terrible,
and you said it, I didn't.
(Laughter)
CA: You know, looking ahead,
one huge initiative
SpaceX is believed to be,
rumored to be working on,
is a massive network of literally
thousands of low earth orbit satellites
to provide high-bandwidth,
low-cost internet connection
to every square foot of planet earth.
Is there anything
you can tell us about this?
GS: We actually don't chat very much
about this particular project,
not because we're hiding anything,
but this is probably
one of the most challenging
if not the most challenging
project we've undertaken.
No one has been successful
deploying a huge constellation
for internet broadband,
or basically for satellite internet,
and I don't think physics
is the difficulty here.
I think we can come up
with the right technology solution,
but we need to make a business out of it,
and it'll cost the company
about 10 billion dollars or more
to deploy this system.
And so we're marching steadily along
but we're certainly
not claiming victory yet.
CA: I mean, the impact of that,
obviously, if that happened to the world,
of connectivity everywhere,
would be pretty radical,
and perhaps mainly for good --
I mean, it changes a lot
if suddenly everyone can connect cheaply.
GS: Yeah, there's no question
it'll change the world.
CA: How much of a worry is it,
and how much of a drag
on the planning is it,
are concerns just about space junk?
People worry a lot about this.
This would a huge increase in the total
number of satellites in orbit.
Is that a concern?
GS: So space debris is a concern,
there's no question --
not because it's so likely to happen,
but the consequences of it happening
are pretty devastating.
You could basically spew
a bunch of particles in orbit
that could take out that orbit
from being useful for decades or longer.
So as a matter of fact,
we are required to bring down
our second stage after every mission
so it doesn't end up being
a rocket carcass orbiting earth.
So you really need to be
a good steward of that.
CA: So despite
the remarkable success there
of that Falcon Heavy rocket,
you're actually not focusing on that
as your future development plan.
You're doubling down
to a much bigger rocket
called the BFR,
which stands for ...
GS: It's the Big Falcon Rocket.
CA: The Big Falcon Rocket, that's right.
(Laughter)
What's the business logic of doing this
when you invested all that
in that incredible technology,
and now you're just going
to something much bigger. Why?
GS: Actually, we've learned some lessons
over the duration where we've
been developing these launch systems.
What we want to do is not introduce
a new product before we've been able
to convince the customers that this
is the product that they should move to,
so we're working on
the Big Falcon Rocket now,
but we're going to continue
flying Falcon 9s and Falcon Heavies
until there is absolute
widespread acceptance of BFR.
But we are working on it right now,
we're just not going to cancel
Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy
and just put in place BFR.
CA: The logic is that BFR is what you need
to take humanity to Mars?
GS: That's correct.
CA: But somehow, you've also found
other business ideas for this.
GS: Yes. BFR can take the satellites
that we're currently taking to orbit
to many orbits.
It allows for even a new class
of satellites to be delivered to orbit.
Basically, the width, the diameter
of the fairing is eight meters,
so you can think about
what giant telescopes
you can put in that fairing,
in that cargo bay,
and see really incredible things
and discover incredible things in space.
But then there are some
residual capabilities
that we have out of BFR as well.
CA: A residual capability?
GS: It's a residual capability.
CA: Is that what you call this?
Talk about what the heck this is.
Oh wait a sec --
GS: That's Falcon Heavy.
That's worth pointing out, by the way.
What a beautiful rocket,
and that hangar could just fit
the Statue of Liberty in it,
so you get a sense of size
of that Falcon Heavy Rocket.
CA: And the fact that
there are 27 engines there.
That's part of the design principle
that you, rather than just
inventing ever bigger rockets,
you team them up.
GS: It's exactly this residual capability.
We developed the Merlin engine
for the Falcon 1 launch vehicle.
We could have tossed that engine
and built an entirely new engine
for the Falcon 9.
It would have been called
something different,
because Falcon 9 is nine Merlin engines,
but instead of spending a billion dollars
on a brand new engine,
we put nine of them together
on the back end of Falcon 9.
Residual capability:
glue three Falcon 9s together
and you have the largest
operational rocket flying.
And so it was expensive to do,
but it was a much more efficient path
than starting from scratch.
CA: And the BFR is the equivalent
of how much bigger than that,
in terms of its power?
GS: BFR is about, I believe,
two and half times the size of this.
CA: Right, and so that allows you --
I mean, I still don't really believe
this video that we're about to play here.
What on earth is this?
GS: So it currently is on earth,
but this is basically
space travel for earthlings.
I can't wait for this residual capability.
Basically, what we're going to do
is we're going to fly BFR like an aircraft
and do point-to-point travel on earth,
so you can take off
from New York City or Vancouver
and fly halfway across the globe.
You'll be on the BFR for roughly
half an hour or 40 minutes,
and the longest part --
yeah, it's so awesome.
(Applause)
The longest part of that flight
is actually the boat out and back.
(Laughter)
CA: I mean. Gwynne, come on,
this is awesome, but it's crazy, right?
This is never going to actually happen.
GS: Oh no, it's definitely
going to happen.
This is definitely going to happen.
CA: How?
(Applause)
So first of all, countries are going
to accept this incoming missile --
(Laughter)
GS: Chris, so can you imagine
us trying to convince a federal range,
Air Force bases to take the incomers?
Because we're doing it now,
regularly, right?
We're bringing the first stages back,
and we're landing them
on federal property on an Air Force base.
So I think doing it, I don't know,
10 kilometers out from a city, maybe
it's only five kilometers out from a city.
CA: So how many passengers
can possibly afford the fortune
of flying by space?
GS: So the first BFR is going to have
roughly a hundred passengers.
And let's talk a little bit
about the business.
Everyone thinks rockets
are really expensive,
and to a large degree they are,
and how could we possibly compete
with airline tickets here?
But if you think about it,
if I can do this trip
in half an hour to an hour,
I can do dozens of these a day, right?
And yet, a long-haul aircraft
can only make one of those flights a day.
So even if my rocket
was slightly more expensive
and the fuel is
a little bit more expensive,
I can run 10x at least
what they're running in a day,
and really make the revenue
that I need to out of that system.
CA: So you really believe this is going
to be deployed at some point
in our amazing future. When?
GS: Within a decade, for sure.
CA: And this is Gwynne time or Elon time?
GS: That's Gwynne time.
I'm sure Elon will want us to go faster.
(Laughter)
CA: OK, that's certainly amazing.
(Laughter)
GS: I'm personally invested in this one,
because I travel a lot
and I do not love to travel,
and I would love to get to see
my customers in Riyadh,
leave in the morning
and be back in time to make dinner.
CA: So we're going to test this out.
So within 10 years,
an economy price ticket,
or, like, a couple thousand dollars
per person to fly New York to Shanghai.
GS: Yeah, I think it'll be between
economy and business,
but you do it in an hour.
CA: Yeah, well, OK,
that is definitely something.
(Laughter)
And meanwhile, the other use
of BFR is being developed
to go a little bit further than Shanghai.
Talk about this.
You guys have actually developed
quite a detailed, sort of, picture
of how humans might fly to Mars,
and what that would look like.
GS: Yeah. So we've got a video,
this is a cropped video
from others we've shown, and then
there's a couple of new bits to it.
But basically, you're going
to lift off from a pad,
you've got a booster as well as the BFS,
the Big Falcon Spaceship.
It's going to take off.
The booster is going to drop
the spaceship off in orbit,
low earth orbit,
and then return just like
we're returning boosters right now.
So it sounds incredible,
but we're working on the pieces,
and you can see us achieve these pieces.
So booster comes back.
The new thing here
is that we're going to actually land
on the pad that we launched from.
Currently, we land on a separate pad,
or we land out on a boat.
Fast, quick connect.
You take a cargo ship full of fuel,
or a fuel depot,
put it on that booster, get that in orbit,
do a docking maneuver,
refuel the spaceship,
and head on to your destination,
and this one is Mars.
CA: So, like, a hundred people
go to Mars at one time,
taking, what, six months? Two months?
GS: It ends up depending
on how big the rocket is.
I think this first version,
and we'll continue to make
even bigger BFRs,
I think it's a three-month trip.
Right now, the average is six to eight,
but we're going to try to do it faster.
CA: When do you believe SpaceX
will land the first human on Mars?
GS: It's a very similar time frame
from the point-to-point.
It's the same capability.
It will be within a decade --
not this decade.
CA: In real time, again, within a decade.
Well, that would also be amazing.
(Laughter)
Why, though? Seriously, why?
I mean, you've got a company
where this is the official stated mission.
Has everyone actually
bought into that mission,
given that, I mean,
there's a lot of people around
who think, come on,
you've got so much talent,
so much technology capability.
There are so many things on earth
that need urgent attention.
Why would you have this escape trip
off to another planet?
(Applause)
GS: So I am glad you asked that,
but I think we need
to expand our minds a little bit.
There are plenty of things to do on earth,
but there are lots of companies
working on that.
I think we're working on one of
the most important things we possibly can,
and that's to find another place
for humans to live and survive and thrive.
If something happened on earth,
you need humans living somewhere else.
(Applause)
It's the fundamental risk reduction
for the human species.
And this does not subvert
making our planet here better
and doing a better job taking care of it,
but I think you need
multiple paths to survival,
and this is one of them.
And let's not talk about the downer piece,
like, you go to Mars to make sure
all earthlings don't die.
That's terrible, actually,
that's a terrible reason to go do it.
Fundamentally,
it's another place to explore,
and that's what makes humans
different from animals,
it's our sense of exploration
and sense of wonderment
and learning something new.
And then I also have to say,
this is the first step
in us moving to other solar systems
and potentially other galaxies,
and I think this is the only time
I ever out-vision Elon,
because I want to meet other people
in other solar systems.
Mars is fine, but it is
a fixer-upper planet.
There's work to do there
to make it habitable.
(Laughter)
I want to find people,
or whatever they call themselves,
in another solar system.
CA: That is a big vision.
Gwynne Shotwell, thank you.
You have one of the most
amazing jobs on the planet.
GS: Thank you very much. Thanks, Chris.
Imagine waking up to a stranger --
sometimes multiple strangers --
questioning your right to existence
for something that you wrote online,
waking up to an angry message,
scared and worried for your safety.
Welcome to the world of cyberharassment.
The kind of harassment that women
face in Pakistan is very serious
and leads to sometimes deadly outcomes.
This kind of harassment keeps women
from accessing the internet --
essentially, knowledge.
It's a form of oppression.
Pakistan is the sixth most populous
country in the world,
with 140 million people having access
to mobile technologies,
and 15 percent internet penetration.
And this number doesn't seem to go down
with the rise of new technologies.
Pakistan is also the birthplace
of the youngest Nobel Peace Prize winner,
Malala Yousafzai.
But that's just one aspect of Pakistan.
Another aspect is where
the twisted concept of honor
is linked to women and their bodies;
where men are allowed to disrespect women
and even kill them sometimes
in the name of so-called "family honor";
where women are left to die
right outside their houses
for speaking to a man on a mobile phone,
in the name of "family honor."
Let me say this very clearly:
it's not honor;
it's a cold-blooded murder.
I come from a very small village
in Punjab, Pakistan,
where women are not allowed
to pursue their higher education.
The elders of my extended family
didn't allow their women
to pursue their higher education
or their professional careers.
However, unlike the other
male guardians of my family,
my father was one who really
supported my ambitions.
To get my law degree,
of course, it was really difficult,
and [there were] frowns of disapproval.
But in the end, I knew
it's either me or them,
and I chose myself.
(Applause)
My family's traditions
and expectations for a woman
wouldn't allow me to own a mobile
phone until I was married.
And even when I was married,
this tool became a tool
for my own surveillance.
When I resisted this idea
of being surveilled by my ex-husband,
he really didn't approve of this
and threw me out of his house,
along with my six-month-old
son, Abdullah.
And that was the time
when I first asked myself, "Why?
Why are women not allowed
to enjoy the same equal rights
enshrined in our Constitution?
While the law states that a woman
has the same equal access
to the information,
why is it always men -- brothers,
fathers and husbands --
who are granting these rights to us,
effectively making the law irrelevant?"
So I decided to take a step,
instead of keep questioning
these patriarchal structures
and societal norms.
And I founded the Digital Rights
Foundation in 2012
to address all the issues
and women's experiences in online spaces
and cyberharassment.
From lobbying for free and safe internet
to convincing young women
that access to the safe internet
is their fundamental, basic, human right,
I'm trying to play my part
in igniting the spark
to address the questions
that have bothered me all these years.
With a hope in my heart,
and to offer a solution to this menace,
I started Pakistan's and the region's
first cyberharassment help line
in December 2016 --
(Applause)
to extend my support to the women
who do not know who to turn to
when they face serious threats online.
I think of the women who do not have
the necessary support
to deal with the mental trauma
when they feel unsafe in online spaces,
and they go about their daily activities,
thinking that there is
a rape threat in their in-box.
Safe access to the internet
is an access to knowledge,
and knowledge is freedom.
When I fight for women's digital rights,
I'm fighting for equality.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Chris Anderson: William, hi. Good to see you.
William Kamkwamba: Thanks.
CA: So, we've got a picture, I think? Where is this?
WK: This is my home. This is where I live.
CA: Where? What country?
WK: In Malawi, Kasungu. In Kasungu. Yeah, Mala.
CA: OK. Now, you're 19 now?
WK: Yeah. I'm 19 years now.
CA: Five years ago you had an idea. What was that?
WK: I wanted to make a windmill.
CA: A windmill?
WK: Yeah.
CA: What, to power -- for lighting and stuff?
WK: Yeah.
CA: So what did you do? How did you realize that?
WK: After I dropped out of school, I went to library,
and I read a book that would -- "Using Energy,"
and I get information about doing the mill.
And I tried, and I made it.
(Applause)
CA: So you copied -- you exactly copied the design in the book.
WK: Ah, no. I just --
CA: What happened?
WK: In fact, a design of the windmill that was in the book,
it has got four -- ah -- three blades,
and mine has got four blades.
CA: The book had three, yours had four.
WK: Yeah.
CA: And you made it out of what?
WK: I made four blades, just because I want to increase power.
CA: OK.
WK: Yeah.
CA: You tested three, and found that four worked better?
WK: Yeah. I test.
CA: And what did you make the windmill out of?
What materials did you use?
WK: I use a bicycle frame, and a pulley, and plastic pipe, what then pulls --
CA: Do we have a picture of that? Can we have the next slide?
WK: Yeah. The windmill.
CA: And so, and that windmill, what -- it worked?
WK: When the wind blows, it rotates and generates.
CA: How much electricity?
WK: 12 watts.
CA: And so, that lit a light for the house? How many lights?
WK: Four bulbs and two radios.
CA: Wow.
WK: Yeah.
(Applause) CA: Next slide --
so who's that?
WK: This is my parents, holding the radio.
CA: So what did they make of -- that you were 14, 15 at the time --
what did they make of this? They were impressed?
WK: Yeah.
CA: And so what's your -- what are you going to do with this?
WK: Um --
CA: What do you -- I mean -- do you want to build another one?
WK: Yeah, I want to build another one --
to pump water and irrigation for crops.
CA: So this one would have to be bigger?
WK: Yeah.
CA: How big?
WK: I think it will produce more than 20 the watts.
CA: So that would produce irrigation for the entire village?
WK: Yeah.
CA: Wow. And so you're talking to people here at TED
to get people who might be able to help in some way
to realize this dream?
WK: Yeah, if they can help me with materials, yeah.
CA: And as you think of your life going forward,
you're 19 now,
do you picture continuing with this dream of working in energy?
WK: Yeah. I'm still thinking to work on energy.
CA: Wow. William, it's a real honor to have you at the TED conference.
Thank you so much for coming.
WK: Thank you.
(Applause)
One of my favorite cartoon characters is Snoopy.
I love the way he sits and lies on his kennel and contemplates the great things of life.
So when I thought about compassion,
my mind immediately went to one of the cartoon strips,
where he's lying there and he says,
"I really understand, and I really appreciate
how one should love one's neighbor as one love's oneself.
The only trouble is the people next door; I can't stand them."
This, in a way, is one of the challenges
of how to interpret a really good idea.
We all, I think, believe in compassion.
If you look at all the world religions, all the main world religions,
you'll find within them some teaching concerning compassion.
So in Judaism, we have, from our Torah,
that you should love your neighbor as you love yourself.
And within Jewish teachings, the rabbinic teachings, we have Hillel,
who taught that you shouldn't do to others what you don't like being done to yourself.
And all the main religions have similar teachings.
And again, within Judaism,
we have a teaching about God,
who is called the compassionate one, Ha-rachaman.
After all, how could the world exist without God being compassionate?
And we, as taught within the Torah that we are made in the image of God,
so we too have to be compassionate.
But what does it mean? How does it impact on our everyday life?
Sometimes, of course, being compassionate
can produce feelings within us that are very difficult to control.
I know there are many times when I've gone and conducted a funeral,
or when I have been sitting with the bereaved, or with people who are dying,
and I am overwhelmed by the sadness, by the difficulty,
the challenge that is there for the family, for the person.
And I'm touched, so that tears come to my eyes.
And yet, if I just allowed myself to be overwhelmed by these feelings,
I wouldn't be doing my job --
because I have to actually be there for them
and make sure that rituals happen, that practicalities are seen to.
And yet, on the other hand, if I didn't feel this compassion,
then I feel that it would be time for me to hang up my robe
and give up being a rabbi.
And these same feelings are there for all of us as we face the world.
Who cannot be touched by compassion
when we see the terrible horrors of the results of war,
or famine, or earthquakes, or tsunamis?
I know some people who say
"Well, you know there's just so much out there -- I can't do anything,
I'm not going to even begin to try."
And there are some charity workers who call this compassion fatigue.
There are others who feel they can't confront compassion anymore,
and so they turn off the television and don't watch.
In Judaism, though, we tend to always say, there has to be a middle way.
You have to, of course, be aware of the needs of others,
but you have to be aware in such a way that you can carry on with your life
and be of help to people.
So part of compassion has to be an understanding of what makes people tick.
And, of course, you can't do that unless you understand yourself a bit more.
And there's a lovely rabbinic interpretation of the beginnings of creation,
which says that when God created the world,
God thought that it would be best to create the world
only with the divine attribute of justice.
Because, after all, God is just.
Therefore, there should be justice throughout the world.
And then God looked to the future and realized,
if the world was created just with justice, the world couldn't exist.
So, God thought, "Nope, I'm going to create the world just with compassion."
And then God looked to the future and realized that,
in fact, if the world were just filled with compassion,
there would be anarchy and chaos.
There had to be limits to all things.
The rabbis describe this as being like a king
who has a beautiful, fragile glass bowl.
If you put too much cold water in, it will shatter.
If you put boiling water in, it will shatter.
What do you have to do? Put in a mixture of the two.
And so God put both of these possibilities into the world.
There is something more though that has to be there.
And that is the translation of the feelings
that we may have about compassion
into the wider world, into action.
So, like Snoopy, we can't just lie there
and think great thoughts about our neighbors.
We actually have to do something about it.
And so there is also, within Judaism, this notion of love and kindness
that becomes very important: "chesed."
All these three things, then, have to be melded together.
The idea of justice, which gives boundaries to our lives
and gives us a feeling of what's right about life, what's right about living,
what should we be doing, social justice.
There has to be a willingness to do good deeds,
but not, of course, at the expense of our own sanity.
You know, there's no way that you can do anything for anyone
if you overdo things.
And balancing them all in the middle is this notion of compassion,
which has to be there, if you like, at our very roots.
This idea of compassion comes to us
because we're made in the image of God,
who is ultimately the compassionate one.
What does this compassion entail?
It entails understanding the pain of the other.
But even more than that,
it means understanding one's connection to the whole of creation:
understanding that one is part of that creation,
that there is a unity that underlies all that we see,
all that we hear, all that we feel.
I call that unity God.
And that unity is something that connects all of creation.
And, of course, in the modern world, with the environmental movement,
we're becoming even more aware of the connectivity of things,
that something I do here actually does matter in Africa,
that if I use too much of my carbon allowance,
it seems to be that we are causing
a great lack of rain in central and eastern Africa.
So there is a connectivity,
and I have to understand that -- as part of the creation,
as part of me being made in the image of God.
And I have to understand that my needs
sometimes have to be sublimated to other needs.
This "18 minutes" business, I find quite fascinating.
Because in Judaism, the number 18, in Hebrew letters,
stands for life -- the word "life."
So, in a sense, the 18 minutes is challenging me to say,
"In life, this is what's important in terms of compassion."
But, something else as well:
actually, 18 minutes is important.
Because at Passover, when we have to eat unleavened bread,
the rabbis say, what is the difference between dough that is made into bread,
and dough that is made into unleavened bread, or "matzah"?
And they say "It's 18 minutes."
Because that's how long they say it takes for this dough to become leaven.
What does it mean, "dough becomes leaven"?
It means it gets filled with hot air.
What's matzah? What's unleavened bread? You don't get it.
Symbolically, what the rabbis say is that at Passover,
what we have to do is try to get rid of our hot air -- our pride,
our feeling that we are the most important people in the whole entire world,
and that everything should revolve round us.
So we try and get rid of those,
and so doing, try to get rid of the habits, the emotions, the ideas
that enslave us, that make our eyes closed, give us tunnel vision
so we don't see the needs of others --
and free ourselves and free ourselves from that.
And that too is a basis for having compassion,
for understanding our place in the world.
Now there is, in Judaism, a gorgeous story
of a rich man who sat in synagogue one day.
And, as many people do, he was dozing off during the sermon.
And as he was dozing off, they were reading from the book of Leviticus in the Torah.
And they were saying that in the ancient times in the temple in Jerusalem,
the priests used to have bread,
which they used to place into a special table in the temple in Jerusalem.
The man was asleep, but he heard the words bread, temple, God, and he woke up.
He said, "God wants bread. That's it. God wants bread. I know what God wants."
And he rushed home. And after the Sabbath, he made 12 loaves of bread,
took them to the synagogue, went into the synagogue,
opened the ark and said, "God, I don't know why you want this bread, but here you are."
And he put it in the ark with the scrolls of the Torah.
Then he went home.
The cleaner came into the synagogue.
"Oh God, I'm in such trouble. I've got children to feed.
My wife's ill. I've got no money. What can I do?"
He goes into the synagogue. "God, will you please help me?
Ah, what a wonderful smell."
He goes to the ark. He opens the ark.
"There's bread! God, you've answered my plea. You've answered my question."
Takes the bread and goes home.
Meanwhile, the rich man thinks to himself,
"I'm an idiot. God wants bread?
God, the one who rules the entire universe, wants my bread?"
He rushes to the synagogue. "I'll get it out of the ark before anybody finds it."
He goes in there, and it's not there.
And he says, "God, you really did want it. You wanted my bread.
Next week, with raisins."
This went on for years.
Every week, the man would bring bread with raisins,
with all sorts of good things, put it into the ark.
Every week, the cleaner would come. "God you've answered my plea again."
Take the bread. Take it home.
Went on until a new rabbi came. Rabbis always spoil things.
The rabbi came in and saw what was going on.
And he called the two of them to his office.
And he said, you know, "This is what's happening."
And the rich man -- oh, dear -- crestfallen.
"You mean God didn't want my bread?"
And the poor man said, "And you mean God didn't answer my pleas?"
And the rabbi said, "You've misunderstood me.
You've misunderstood totally," he said.
"Of course, what you are doing," he said to the rich man,
"is answering God's plea that we should be compassionate.
And God," he said to the poor man, "is answering your plea
that people should be compassionate and give."
He looked at the rich man. He held the rich man's hands and said,
"Don't you understand?" He said, "These are the hands of God."
So that is the way I feel:
that I can only try to approach this notion of being compassionate,
of understanding that there is a connectivity, that there is a unity in this world;
that I want to try and serve that unity,
and that I can try and do that by understanding, I hope,
trying to understand something of the pain of others;
but understanding that there are limits, that people have to bear responsibility
for some of the problems that come upon them;
and that I have to understand that there are limits to my energy,
to the giving I can give.
I have to reevaluate them,
try and separate out the material things
and my emotions that may be enslaving me,
so that I can see the world clearly.
And then I have to try to see in what ways
I can make these the hands of God.
And so try to bring compassion to life in this world.
I grew up on a steady diet of science fiction.
In high school, I took a bus to school
an hour each way every day.
And I was always absorbed in a book,
science fiction book,
which took my mind to other worlds,
and satisfied, in a narrative form,
this insatiable sense of curiosity that I had.
And you know, that curiosity also manifested itself
in the fact that whenever I wasn't in school
I was out in the woods,
hiking and taking "samples" --
frogs and snakes and bugs and pond water --
and bringing it back, looking at it under the microscope.
You know, I was a real science geek.
But it was all about trying to understand the world,
understand the limits of possibility.
And my love of science fiction
actually seemed mirrored in the world around me,
because what was happening, this was in the late '60s,
we were going to the moon,
we were exploring the deep oceans.
Jacques Cousteau was coming into our living rooms
with his amazing specials that showed us
animals and places and a wondrous world
that we could never really have previously imagined.
So, that seemed to resonate
with the whole science fiction part of it.
And I was an artist.
I could draw. I could paint.
And I found that because there weren't video games
and this saturation of CG movies and all of this
imagery in the media landscape,
I had to create these images in my head.
You know, we all did, as kids having to
read a book, and through the author's description,
put something on the movie screen in our heads.
And so, my response to this was to paint, to draw
alien creatures, alien worlds,
robots, spaceships, all that stuff.
I was endlessly getting busted in math class
doodling behind the textbook.
That was -- the creativity
had to find its outlet somehow.
And an interesting thing happened: The Jacques Cousteau shows
actually got me very excited about the fact that there was
an alien world right here on Earth.
I might not really go to an alien world
on a spaceship someday --
that seemed pretty darn unlikely.
But that was a world I could really go to,
right here on Earth, that was as rich and exotic
as anything that I had imagined
from reading these books.
So, I decided I was going to become a scuba diver
at the age of 15.
And the only problem with that was that I lived
in a little village in Canada,
600 miles from the nearest ocean.
But I didn't let that daunt me.
I pestered my father until he finally found
a scuba class in Buffalo, New York,
right across the border from where we live.
And I actually got certified
in a pool at a YMCA in the dead of winter
in Buffalo, New York.
And I didn't see the ocean, a real ocean,
for another two years,
until we moved to California.
Since then, in the intervening
40 years,
I've spent about 3,000 hours underwater,
and 500 hours of that was in submersibles.
And I've learned that that deep-ocean environment,
and even the shallow oceans,
are so rich with amazing life
that really is beyond our imagination.
Nature's imagination is so boundless
compared to our own
meager human imagination.
I still, to this day, stand in absolute awe
of what I see when I make these dives.
And my love affair with the ocean is ongoing,
and just as strong as it ever was.
But when I chose a career as an adult,
it was filmmaking.
And that seemed to be the best way to reconcile
this urge I had to tell stories
with my urges to create images.
And I was, as a kid, constantly drawing comic books, and so on.
So, filmmaking was the way to put pictures and stories
together, and that made sense.
And of course the stories that I chose to tell
were science fiction stories: "Terminator," "Aliens"
and "The Abyss."
And with "The Abyss," I was putting together my love
of underwater and diving with filmmaking.
So, you know, merging the two passions.
Something interesting came out of "The Abyss,"
which was that to solve a specific narrative
problem on that film,
which was to create this kind of liquid water creature,
we actually embraced computer generated animation, CG.
And this resulted in the first soft-surface
character, CG animation
that was ever in a movie.
And even though the film didn't make any money --
barely broke even, I should say --
I witnessed something amazing, which is that the audience,
the global audience, was mesmerized
by this apparent magic.
You know, it's Arthur Clarke's law
that any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.
They were seeing something magical.
And so that got me very excited.
And I thought, "Wow, this is something that needs to be embraced
into the cinematic art."
So, with "Terminator 2," which was my next film,
we took that much farther.
Working with ILM, we created the liquid metal dude
in that film. The success hung in the balance
on whether that effect would work.
And it did, and we created magic again,
and we had the same result with an audience --
although we did make a little more money on that one.
So, drawing a line through those two dots
of experience
came to, "This is going to be a whole new world,"
this was a whole new world of creativity
for film artists.
So, I started a company with Stan Winston,
my good friend Stan Winston,
who is the premier make-up and creature designer
at that time, and it was called Digital Domain.
And the concept of the company was
that we would leapfrog past
the analog processes of optical printers and so on,
and we would go right to digital production.
And we actually did that and it gave us a competitive advantage for a while.
But we found ourselves lagging in the mid '90s
in the creature and character design stuff
that we had actually founded the company to do.
So, I wrote this piece called "Avatar,"
which was meant to absolutely push the envelope
of visual effects,
of CG effects, beyond,
with realistic human emotive characters
generated in CG,
and the main characters would all be in CG,
and the world would be in CG.
And the envelope pushed back,
and I was told by the folks at my company
that we weren't going to be able to do this for a while.
So, I shelved it, and I made this other movie about a big ship that sinks.
(Laughter)
You know, I went and pitched it to the studio as "'Romeo and Juliet' on a ship:
"It's going to be this epic romance,
passionate film."
Secretly, what I wanted to do was
I wanted to dive to the real wreck of "Titanic."
And that's why I made the movie.
(Applause)
And that's the truth. Now, the studio didn't know that.
But I convinced them. I said,
"We're going to dive to the wreck. We're going to film it for real.
We'll be using it in the opening of the film.
It will be really important. It will be a great marketing hook."
And I talked them into funding an expedition.
(Laughter)
Sounds crazy. But this goes back to that theme
about your imagination creating a reality.
Because we actually created a reality where six months later,
I find myself in a Russian submersible
two and a half miles down in the north Atlantic,
looking at the real Titanic through a view port.
Not a movie, not HD -- for real.
(Applause)
Now, that blew my mind.
And it took a lot of preparation, we had to build cameras
and lights and all kinds of things.
But, it struck me how much
this dive, these deep dives,
was like a space mission.
You know, where it was highly technical,
and it required enormous planning.
You get in this capsule, you go down to this dark
hostile environment
where there is no hope of rescue
if you can't get back by yourself.
And I thought like, "Wow. I'm like,
living in a science fiction movie.
This is really cool."
And so, I really got bitten by the bug of deep-ocean exploration.
Of course, the curiosity, the science component of it --
it was everything. It was adventure,
it was curiosity, it was imagination.
And it was an experience that
Hollywood couldn't give me.
Because, you know, I could imagine a creature and we could
create a visual effect for it. But I couldn't imagine what I was seeing
out that window.
As we did some of our subsequent expeditions,
I was seeing creatures at hydrothermal vents
and sometimes things that I had never seen before,
sometimes things that no one had seen before,
that actually were not described by science
at the time that we saw them and imaged them.
So, I was completely smitten by this,
and had to do more.
And so, I actually made a kind of curious decision.
After the success of "Titanic,"
I said, "OK, I'm going to park my day job
as a Hollywood movie maker,
and I'm going to go be a full-time explorer for a while."
And so, we started planning these
expeditions.
And we wound up going to the Bismark,
and exploring it with robotic vehicles.
We went back to the Titanic wreck.
We took little bots that we had created
that spooled a fiber optic.
And the idea was to go in and do an interior
survey of that ship, which had never been done.
Nobody had ever looked inside the wreck. They didn't have the means to do it,
so we created technology to do it.
So, you know, here I am now, on the deck
of Titanic, sitting in a submersible,
and looking out at planks that look much like this,
where I knew that the band had played.
And I'm flying a little robotic vehicle
through the corridor of the ship.
When I say, "I'm operating it,"
but my mind is in the vehicle.
I felt like I was physically present
inside the shipwreck of Titanic.
And it was the most surreal kind
of deja vu experience I've ever had,
because I would know before I turned a corner
what was going to be there before the lights
of the vehicle actually revealed it,
because I had walked the set for months
when we were making the movie.
And the set was based as an exact replica
on the blueprints of the ship.
So, it was this absolutely remarkable experience.
And it really made me realize that
the telepresence experience --
that you actually can have these robotic avatars,
then your consciousness is injected into the vehicle,
into this other form of existence.
It was really, really quite profound.
And it may be a little bit of a glimpse as to what might be happening
some decades out
as we start to have cyborg bodies
for exploration or for other means
in many sort of
post-human futures
that I can imagine,
as a science fiction fan.
So, having done these expeditions,
and really beginning to appreciate what was down there,
such as at the deep ocean vents
where we had these amazing, amazing animals --
they're basically aliens right here on Earth.
They live in an environment of chemosynthesis.
They don't survive on sunlight-based
system the way we do.
And so, you're seeing animals that are living next to
a 500-degree-Centigrade
water plumes.
You think they can't possibly exist.
At the same time
I was getting very interested in space science as well --
again, it's the science fiction influence, as a kid.
And I wound up getting involved with
the space community,
really involved with NASA,
sitting on the NASA advisory board,
planning actual space missions,
going to Russia, going through the pre-cosmonaut
biomedical protocols,
and all these sorts of things,
to actually go and fly to the international space station
with our 3D camera systems.
And this was fascinating.
But what I wound up doing was bringing space scientists
with us into the deep.
And taking them down so that they had access --
astrobiologists, planetary scientists,
people who were interested in these extreme environments --
taking them down to the vents, and letting them see,
and take samples and test instruments, and so on.
So, here we were making documentary films,
but actually doing science,
and actually doing space science.
I'd completely closed the loop
between being the science fiction fan,
you know, as a kid,
and doing this stuff for real.
And you know, along the way in this journey
of discovery,
I learned a lot.
I learned a lot about science. But I also learned a lot
about leadership.
Now you think director has got to be a leader,
leader of, captain of the ship, and all that sort of thing.
I didn't really learn about leadership
until I did these expeditions.
Because I had to, at a certain point, say,
"What am I doing out here?
Why am I doing this? What do I get out of it?"
We don't make money at these damn shows.
We barely break even. There is no fame in it.
People sort of think I went away
between "Titanic" and "Avatar" and was buffing my nails
someplace, sitting at the beach.
Made all these films, made all these documentary films
for a very limited audience.
No fame, no glory, no money. What are you doing?
You're doing it for the task itself,
for the challenge --
and the ocean is the most challenging environment there is --
for the thrill of discovery,
and for that strange bond that happens
when a small group of people form a tightly knit team.
Because we would do these things with 10, 12 people,
working for years at a time,
sometimes at sea for two, three months at a time.
And in that bond, you realize
that the most important thing
is the respect that you have for them
and that they have for you, that you've done a task
that you can't explain to someone else.
When you come back to the shore and you say,
"We had to do this, and the fiber optic, and the attentuation,
and the this and the that,
all the technology of it, and the difficulty,
the human-performance aspects of working at sea,"
you can't explain it to people. It's that thing that
maybe cops have, or people in combat that have gone through something together
and they know they can never explain it.
Creates a bond, creates a bond of respect.
So, when I came back to make my next movie,
which was "Avatar,"
I tried to apply that same principle of leadership,
which is that you respect your team,
and you earn their respect in return.
And it really changed the dynamic.
So, here I was again with a small team,
in uncharted territory,
doing "Avatar," coming up with new technology
that didn't exist before.
Tremendously exciting.
Tremendously challenging.
And we became a family, over a four-and-half year period.
And it completely changed how I do movies.
So, people have commented on how, "Well, you know,
you brought back the ocean organisms
and put them on the planet of Pandora."
To me, it was more of a fundamental way of doing business,
the process itself, that changed as a result of that.
So, what can we synthesize out of all this?
You know, what are the lessons learned?
Well, I think number one is
curiosity.
It's the most powerful thing you own.
Imagination is a force
that can actually manifest a reality.
And the respect of your team
is more important than all the
laurels in the world.
I have young filmmakers
come up to me and say, "Give me some advice for doing this."
And I say, "Don't put limitations on yourself.
Other people will do that for you -- don't do it to yourself,
don't bet against yourself,
and take risks."
NASA has this phrase that they like:
"Failure is not an option."
But failure has to be an option
in art and in exploration, because it's a leap of faith.
And no important endeavor
that required innovation
was done without risk.
You have to be willing to take those risks.
So, that's the thought I would leave you with,
is that in whatever you're doing,
failure is an option,
but fear is not. Thank you.
(Applause)
Hannah is excited to be going to college.
She couldn't wait
to get out of her parents' house,
to prove to them that she's an adult,
and to prove to her new friends
that she belongs.
She heads to a campus party
where she sees a guy
that she has a crush on.
Let's call him Mike.
The next day, Hannah wakes up
with a pounding headache.
She can only remember
the night in flashes.
But what she does remember is
throwing up in the hall
outside Mike's room
and staring at the wall silently
while he was inside her,
wanting it to stop,
then shakily stumbling home.
She doesn't feel good about what happened,
but she thinks, "Maybe this is just
what sex in college is?"
One in five women and one in 13 men
will be sexually assaulted
at some point during their college career
in the United States.
Less than 10 percent will ever report
their assault to their school
or to the police.
And those who do, on average,
wait 11 months to make the report.
Hannah initially just feels like dealing
with what happened on her own.
But when she sees Mike
taking girls home from parties,
she's worried about them.
After graduation, Hannah learns
that she was one of five women
who Mike did the exact same thing to.
And this is not an unlikely scenario
because 90 percent of sexual assaults
are committed by repeat offenders.
But with such low reporting rates,
it's fairly unlikely that even
repeat perpetrators will be reported,
much less anything happen if they are.
In fact, only six percent
of assaults reported to the police
end with the assailant
spending a single day in prison.
Meaning, there's a 99 percent chance
that they'll get away with it.
This means there's practically
no deterrent to assault
in the United States.
Now, I'm an infectious disease
epidemiologist by training.
I'm interested in systems and networks
and where we can concentrate
our resources to do the most good.
So this, to me, is a tragic
but a solvable problem.
So when the issue of campus assault
started hitting the news a few years ago,
it felt like a unique opportunity
to make a change.
And so we did.
We started by talking
to college survivors.
And what they wish they'd had
in college is pretty simple;
they wanted a website,
one they could use
at the time and place
that felt safest to them
with clearly written information
about their reporting options,
with the ability to electronically
report their assault,
rather than having the first step
to go in and talk to someone
who may or may not believe them.
With the option to create
a secure, timestamped document
of what happened to them,
preserving evidence
even if they don't want to report yet.
And lastly, and perhaps most critically,
with the ability to report their assault
only if someone else
reported the same assailant.
You see, knowing that you weren't
the only one changes everything.
It changes the way
you frame your own experience,
it changes the way
you think about your perpetrator,
it means that if you do come forward,
you'll have someone else's back
and they'll have yours.
We created a website
that actually does this
and we launched it [...] in August,
on two college campuses.
And we included a unique matching system
where if Mike's first victim
had come forward,
saved her record,
entered into the matching system
and named Mike,
and Mike's second victim
had done the same thing
a few months later,
they would have matched
and the verified contact information
of both survivors
would have been sent
to the authorities at the same time
for investigation and follow up.
If a system like this had existed
for Hannah and her peers,
it's more likely
that they would have reported,
that they would have been believed,
and that Mike would have been
kicked off campus,
gone to jail, or at least
gotten the help that he needed.
And if we were able to stop
repeat offenders like Mike
after just their second assault
following a match,
survivors like Hannah
would never even be assaulted
in the first place.
We could prevent
59 percent of sexual assaults
just by stopping
repeat perpetrators earlier on.
And because we're creating
a real deterrent to assault,
for perhaps the first time,
maybe the Mikes of the world
would never even try to assault anyone.
The type of system I'm describing,
the type of system that survivors want
is a type of information escrow,
meaning an entity that holds on
to information for you
and only releases it to a third party
when certain pre-agreed upon
conditions are met,
such as a match.
The application that we built
is for college campuses.
But the same type of system
could be used in the military
or even the workplace.
We don't have to live in a world
where 99 percent of rapists
get away with it.
We can create one
where those who do wrong
are held accountable,
where survivors get the support
and justice they deserve,
where the authorities
get the information they need,
and where there's a real deterrent
to violating the rights
of another human being.
Thank you.
(Applause)
There are three words
that explain why I am here.
They are "Amy Krouse Rosenthal."
At the end of Amy's life,
hyped up on morphine and home in hospice,
the "New York Times"
published an article she wrote
for the "Modern Love" column
on March 3, 2017.
It was read worldwide
by over five million people.
The piece was unbearably sad,
ironically funny
and brutally honest.
While it was certainly
about our life together,
the focus of the piece was me.
It was called, "You May
Want to Marry My Husband."
It was a creative play
on a personal ad for me.
Amy quite literally left
an empty space for me to fill
with another love story.
Amy was my wife for half my life.
She was my partner in raising
three wonderful, now grown children,
and really, she was my girl, you know?
We had so much in common.
We loved the same art,
the same documentaries, the same music.
Music was a huge part
of our life together.
And we shared the same values.
We were in love,
and our love grew stronger
up until her last day.
Amy was a prolific author.
In addition to two groundbreaking memoirs,
she published over 30 children's books.
Posthumously, the book she wrote
with our daughter Paris,
called "Dear Girl,"
reached the number one position
on the "New York Times" bestseller list.
She was a self-described tiny filmmaker.
She was 5'1" and her films
were not that long.
(Laughter)
Her films exemplified her natural ability
to gather people together.
She was also a terrific public speaker,
talking with children
and adults of all ages
all over the world.
Now, my story of grief is only unique
in the sense of it being rather public.
However, the grieving process itself
was not my story alone.
Amy gave me permission to move forward,
and I'm so grateful for that.
Now, just a little over a year
into my new life,
I've learned a few things.
I'm here to share with you
part of the process of moving forward
through and with grief.
But before I do that,
I think it would be important
to talk a little bit
about the end of life,
because it forms how I have been
emotionally since then.
Death is such a taboo subject, right?
Amy ate her last meal on January 9, 2017.
She somehow lived an additional two months
without solid food.
Her doctors told us
we could do hospice at home
or in the hospital.
They did not tell us that Amy
would shrink to half her body weight,
that she would never lay
with her husband again,
and that walking upstairs to our bedroom
would soon feel like running a marathon.
Home hospice does have an aura of being
a beautiful environment to die in.
How great that you don't have
the sounds of machines beeping
and going on and off all the time,
no disruptions for mandatory
drug administration,
home with your family to die.
We did our best to make those weeks
as meaningful as we could.
We talked often about death.
Everybody knows it's going
to happen to them, like, for sure,
but being able to talk openly
about it was liberating.
We talked about subjects like parenting.
I asked Amy how I could be the best parent
possible to our children in her absence.
In those conversations,
she gave me confidence
by stressing what a great relationship
I had with each one of them,
and that I can do it.
I know there will be many times
where I wish she and I
can make decisions together.
We were always so in sync.
May I be so audacious as to suggest
that you have these conversations now,
when healthy.
Please don't wait.
As part of our hospice experience,
we organized groups of visitors.
How brave of Amy to receive them,
even as she began her physical decline.
We had a Krouse night,
her parents and three siblings.
Friends and family were next.
Each told beautiful stories
of Amy and of us.
Amy made an immense impact
on her loyal friends.
But home hospice is not so beautiful
for the surviving family members.
I want to get a little personal here
and tell you that to this date,
I have memories of those
final weeks that haunt me.
I remember walking backwards
to the bathroom,
assisting Amy with each step.
I felt so strong.
I'm not such a big guy,
but my arms looked and felt so healthy
compared to Amy's frail body.
And that body failed in our house.
On March 13 of last year,
my wife died of ovarian cancer in our bed.
I carried her lifeless body
down our stairs,
through our dining room
and our living room
to a waiting gurney
to have her body cremated.
I will never get that image
out of my head.
If you know someone who has been
through the hospice experience,
acknowledge that.
Just say you heard this guy Jason
talk about how tough it must be
to have those memories
and that you're there
if they ever want to talk about it.
They may not want to talk,
but it's nice to connect with someone
living each day with those lasting images.
I know this sounds unbelievable,
but I've never been asked that question.
Amy's essay caused me
to experience grief in a public way.
Many of the readers who reached out to me
wrote beautiful words of reflection.
The scope of Amy's impact
was deeper and richer
than even us and her family knew.
Some of the responses I received helped me
with the intense grieving process
because of their humor,
like this email I received
from a woman reader
who read the article, declaring,
"I will marry you when you are ready --
(Laughter)
"provided you permanently stop drinking.
No other conditions.
I promise to outlive you.
Thank you very much."
Now, I do like a good tequila,
but that really is not my issue.
Yet how could I say no to that proposal?
(Laughter)
I laughed through the tears when I read
this note from a family friend:
"I remember Shabbat dinners at your home
and Amy teaching me
how to make cornbread croutons.
Only Amy could find
creativity in croutons."
(Laughter)
On July 27, just a few months
after Amy's death,
my dad died of complications
related to a decades-long battle
with Parkinson's disease.
I had to wonder: How much
can the human condition handle?
What makes us capable
of dealing with this intense loss
and yet carry on?
Was this a test?
Why my family and my amazing children?
Looking for answers, I regret to say,
is a lifelong mission,
but the key to my being able to persevere
is Amy's expressed and very public edict
that I must go on.
Throughout this year,
I have done just that.
I have attempted to step out
and seek the joy and the beauty
that I know this life
is capable of providing.
But here's the reality:
those family gatherings,
attending weddings
and events honoring Amy,
as loving as they are,
have all been very difficult to endure.
People say I'm amazing.
"How do you handle yourself
that way during those times?"
They say, "You do it with such grace."
Well, guess what?
I really am sad a lot of the time.
I often feel like I'm kind of a mess,
and I know these feelings
apply to other surviving spouses,
children, parents
and other family members.
In Japanese Zen, there is a term "Shoji,"
which translates as "birth death."
There is no separation
between life and death
other than a thin line
that connects the two.
Birth, or the joyous,
wonderful, vital parts of life,
and death, those things
we want to get rid of,
are said to be faced equally.
In this new life that I find myself in,
I am doing my best to embrace this concept
as I move forward with grieving.
In the early months
following Amy's death, though,
I was sure that the feeling of despair
would be ever-present,
that it would be all-consuming.
Soon I was fortunate
to receive some promising advice.
Many members of the losing-a-spouse club
reached out to me.
One friend in particular who had also
lost her life partner kept repeating,
"Jason, you will find joy."
I didn't even know
what she was talking about.
How was that possible?
But because Amy gave me
very public permission
to also find happiness,
I now have experienced joy
from time to time.
There it was, dancing the night away
at an LCD Soundsystem concert,
traveling with my brother and best friend
or with a college buddy on a boys' trip
to meet a group of great guys
I never met before.
From observing that my deck had sun
beating down on it on a cold day,
stepping out in it, laying there,
the warmth consuming my body.
The joy comes from my three
stunning children.
There was my son Justin,
texting me a picture of himself
with an older gentleman
with a massive, strong forearm
and the caption, "I just met Popeye,"
with a huge grin on his face.
(Laughter)
There was his brother Miles,
walking to the train
for his first day of work
after graduating college,
who stopped and looked
back at me and asked,
"What am I forgetting?"
I assured him right away,
"You are 100 percent ready. You got this."
And my daughter Paris,
walking together
through Battersea Park in London,
the leaves piled high,
the sun glistening in the early morning
on our way to yoga.
I would add that beauty
is also there to discover,
and I mean beauty of the wabi-sabi variety
but beauty nonetheless.
On the one hand, when I see something
in this category, I want to say,
"Amy, did you see that? Did you hear that?
It's too beautiful
for you not to share with me."
On the other hand,
I now experience these moments
in an entirely new way.
There was the beauty I found in music,
like the moment in the newest
Manchester Orchestra album,
when the song "The Alien"
seamlessly transitions
into "The Sunshine,"
or the haunting beauty
of Luke Sital-Singh's "Killing Me,"
whose chorus reads,
"And it's killing me
that you're not here with me.
I'm living happily,
but I'm feeling guilty."
There is beauty in the simple moments
that life has to offer,
a way of seeing that world
that was so much a part of Amy's DNA,
like on my morning commute,
looking at the sun
reflecting off of Lake Michigan,
or stopping and truly seeing
how the light shines
at different times of the day
in the house we built together;
even after a Chicago storm,
noticing the fresh buildup of snow
throughout the neighborhood;
or peeking into my daughter's room
as she's practicing the bass guitar.
Listen, I want to make it clear
that I'm a very fortunate person.
I have the most amazing family
that loves and supports me.
I have the resources for personal growth
during my time of grief.
But whether it's a divorce,
losing a job you worked so hard at
or having a family member die suddenly
or of a slow-moving and painful death,
I would like to offer you
what I was given:
a blank of sheet of paper.
What will you do
with your intentional empty space,
with your fresh start?
Thank you.
(Applause)
These are simple objects:
clocks, keys, combs, glasses.
They are the things the victims of genocide in Bosnia
carried with them on their final journey.
We are all familiar with these mundane,
everyday objects.
The fact that some of the victims carried
personal items such as
toothpaste and a toothbrush
is a clear sign they had no idea
what was about to happen to them.
Usually, they were told that they were going to be
exchanged for prisoners of war.
These items have been recovered
from numerous mass graves across my homeland,
and as we speak, forensics are exhuming bodies
from newly discovered mass graves,
20 years after the war.
And it is quite possibly the largest ever discovered.
During the four years of conflict
that devastated the Bosnian nation in the early '90s,
approximately 30,000 citizens, mainly civilians,
went missing, presumed killed,
and another 100,000 were killed
during combat operations.
Most of them were killed
either in the early days of the war
or towards the end of the hostilities,
when U.N. safe zones like Srebrenica
fell into the hands of the Serb army.
The international criminal tribunal
delivered a number of sentences
for crimes against humanity and genocide.
Genocide is a systematic and deliberate
destruction of a racial, political, religious
or ethnic group.
As much as genocide is about killing.
It is also about destroying their property,
their cultural heritage,
and ultimately the very notion that they ever existed.
Genocide is not only about the killing;
it is about the denied identity.
There are always traces —
no such thing as a perfect crime.
There are always remnants of the perished ones
that are more durable than their fragile bodies
and our selective and fading memory of them.
These items are recovered
from numerous mass graves,
and the main goal of this collection of the items
is a unique process
of identifying those who disappeared in the killings,
the first act of genocide on European soil
since the Holocaust.
Not a single body should remain undiscovered
or unidentified.
Once recovered,
these items that the victims carried with them
on their way to execution
are carefully cleaned, analyzed,
catalogued and stored.
Thousands of artifacts are
packed in white plastic bags
just like the ones you see on CSI.
These objects are used as a forensic tool
in visual identification of the victims,
but they are also used as
very valuable forensic evidence
in the ongoing war crimes trials.
Survivors are occasionally called
to try to identify these items physically,
but physical browsing is extremely difficult,
an ineffective and painful process.
Once the forensics and doctors and lawyers
are done with these objects,
they become orphans of the narrative.
Many of them get destroyed, believe it or not,
or they get simply shelved,
out of sight and out of mind.
I decided a few years ago
to photograph every single exhumed item
in order to create a visual archive
that survivors could easily browse.
As a storyteller, I like to give back to the community.
I like to move beyond raising awareness.
And in this case, someone may
recognize these items
or at least their photographs will remain
as a permanent, unbiased and accurate reminder
of what happened.
Photography is about empathy,
and the familiarity of these
items guarantee empathy.
In this case, I am merely a tool,
a forensic, if you like,
and the result is a photography that is as close
as possible of being a document.
Once all the missing persons are identified,
only decaying bodies in their graves
and these everyday items will remain.
In all their simplicity,
these items are the last testament
to the identity of the victims,
the last permanent reminder
that these people ever existed.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
So I tried to do a small good thing for my wife.
It makes me to stand here,
the fame, the money I got out of it.
So what I did, I'd gone back to my early marriage days.
What you did in the early marriage days,
you tried to impress your wife. I did the same.
On that occasion, I found my wife
carrying something like this.
I saw. "What is that?" I asked.
My wife replied, "None of your business."
Then, being her husband, I ran behind her
and saw she had a nasty rag cloth.
I don't even use that cloth to clean my two-wheeler.
Then I understood this -- adapting that unhygienic method
to manage her period days.
Then I immediately asked her, why are you [using] that unhygienic method?
She replied, I also know about [sanitary pads],
but myself and my sisters, if they start using that,
we have to cut our family milk budget.
Then I was shocked. What is the connection between
using a sanitary pad and a milk budget?
And it's called affordability.
I tried to impress my new wife by offering her a packet of sanitary pads.
I went to a local shop, I tried to buy her a sanitary pad packet.
That fellow looks left and right,
and spreads a newspaper, rolls it into the newspaper,
gives it to me like a banned item, something like that.
I don't know why. I did not ask for a condom.
Then I took that pad. I want to see that. What is inside it?
The very first time, at the age of 29,
that day I am touching the sanitary pad, first ever.
I must know: How many of the guys here have touched a sanitary pad?
They are not going to touch that, because it's not your matter.
Then I thought to myself, white substance, made of cotton --
oh my God, that guy is just using a penny value of raw material --
inside they are selling for pounds, dollars.
Why not make a local sanitary pad for my new wife?
That's how all this started, but after making a sanitary pad,
where can I check it?
It's not like I can just check it in the lab.
I need a woman volunteer. Where can I get one in India?
Even in Bangalore you won't get [one], in India.
So only problem: the only available victim is my wife.
Then I made a sanitary pad and handed it to Shanti -- my wife's name is Shanti.
"Close your eyes. Whatever I give,
it will be not a diamond pendant
not a diamond ring, even a chocolate,
I will give you a surprise with a lot of tinsel paper rolled up with it.
Close your eyes."
Because I tried to make it intimate.
Because it's an arranged marriage, not a love marriage.
(Laughter)
So one day she said, openly, I'm not going to support this research.
Then other victims, they got into my sisters.
But even sisters, wives, they're not ready to support in the research.
That's why I am always jealous with the saints in India.
They are having a lot of women volunteers around them.
Why I am not getting [any]?
You know, without them even calling, they'll get a lot of women volunteers.
Then I used, tried to use the medical college girls.
They also refused. Finally, I decide,
use sanitary pad myself.
Now I am having a title like
the first man to set foot on the moon.
Armstrong. Then Tenzing [and] Hillary, in Everest,
like that Muruganantham is the first man
wore a sanitary pad across the globe.
I wore a sanitary pad. I filled animal blood in a football bottle,
I tied it up here, there is a tube going into my panties,
while I'm walking, while I'm cycling, I made a press,
doses of blood will go there.
That makes me bow down to any woman in front of me
to give full respect. That five days I'll never forget --
the messy days, the lousy days, that wetness.
My God, it's unbelievable.
But here the problem is, one company is making napkin
out of cotton. It is working well.
But I am also trying to make sanitary pad with the good cotton. It's not working.
That makes me to want to refuse to continue this research and research and research.
You need first funds.
Not only financial crises, but because of the sanitary pad research,
I come through all sorts of problems, including
a divorce notice from my wife.
Why is this? I used medical college girls.
She suspects I am using as a trump card
to run behind medical college girls.
Finally, I came to know it is a special cellulose
derived from a pinewood, but even after that,
you need a multimillion-dollar plant like this
to process that material. Again, a stop-up.
Then I spend another four years to create my own
machine tools, a simple machine tool like this.
In this machine, any rural woman can apply the same
raw materials that they are processing in the multinational plant,
anyone can make a world-class napkin at your dining hall.
That is my invention.
So after that, what I did,
usually if anyone got a patent or an invention,
immediately you want to make, convert into this.
I never did this. I dropped it just like this,
because you do this, if anyone runs after money,
their life will not [have] any beauty. It is boredom.
A lot of people making a lot of money, billion,
billions of dollars accumulating.
Why are they coming for, finally, for philanthropy?
Why the need for accumulating money, then doing philanthropy?
What if one decided to start philanthropy from the day one?
That's why I am giving this machine
only in rural India, for rural women, because in India,
[you'll be] surprised, only two percent of women
are using sanitary pads. The rest, they're using a rag cloth,
a leaf, husk, [saw] dust, everything except sanitary pads.
It is the same in the 21st century. That's why I am going
to decide to give this machine only for poor women across India.
So far, 630 installations happened in 23 states
in six other countries.
Now I'm on my seventh year sustaining against
multinational, transnational giants -- makes all MBA students a question mark.
A school dropout from Coimbatore, how he is able to sustaining?
That makes me a visiting professor and guest lecturer in all IIMs.
(Applause)
Play video one.
(Video) Arunachalam Muruganantham: The thing I saw in my wife's hand, "Why are you using that nasty cloth?"
She replied immediately, "I know about napkins, but if I start
using napkins, then we have to cut our family milk budget."
Why not make myself a low-cost napkin?
So I decided I'm going to sell this new machine
only for Women Self Help Groups.
That is my idea.
AM: And previously, you need a multimillion investment
for machine and all. Now, any rural woman can.
They are performing puja.
(Video): (Singing)
You just think, competing giants,
even from Harvard, Oxford, is difficult.
I make a rural woman to compete with multinationals.
I'm sustaining on seventh year.
Already 600 installations. What is my mission?
I'm going to make India
[into] a 100-percent-sanitary-napkin-using country in my lifetime.
In this way I'm going to provide not less than a million
rural employment that I'm going to create.
That's why I'm not running after this bloody money.
I'm doing something serious.
If you chase a girl, the girl won't like you.
Do your job simply, the girl will chase you.
Like that, I never chased Mahalakshmi.
Mahalakshmi is chasing me, I am keeping in the back pocket.
Not in front pocket. I'm a back pocket man.
That's all. A school dropout saw your problem in the society
of not using sanitary pad.
I am becoming a solution provider. I'm very happy.
I don't want to make this as a corporate entity.
I want to make this as a local sanitary pad movement
across the globe. That's why I put all the details
on public domain like an open software.
Now 110 countries are accessing it. Okay?
So I classify the people into three:
uneducated, little educated, surplus educated.
Little educated, done this. Surplus educated,
what are you going to do for the society?
Thank you very much. Bye!
(Applause)
You may have heard
about the Koran's idea of paradise
being 72 virgins,
and I promise I will come back
to those virgins.
But in fact, here in the Northwest,
we're living very close
to the real Koranic idea of paradise,
defined 36 times as "gardens
watered by running streams."
Since I live on a houseboat
on the running stream of Lake Union,
this makes perfect sense to me.
But the thing is, how come
it's news to most people?
I know many well-intentioned non-Muslims
who've begun reading
the Koran, but given up,
disconcerted by its "otherness."
The historian Thomas Carlyle
considered Muhammad
one of the world's greatest heroes,
yet even he called the Koran
"as toilsome reading as I ever undertook;
a wearisome, confused jumble."
(Laughter)
Part of the problem,
I think, is that we imagine
that the Koran can be read
as we usually read a book --
as though we can curl up
with it on a rainy afternoon
with a bowl of popcorn within reach,
as though God --
and the Koran is entirely in the voice
of God speaking to Muhammad --
were just another author
on the best-seller list.
Yet, the fact that so few people
do actually read the Koran
is precisely why it's so easy to quote --
that is, to misquote.
(Laughter)
Phrases and snippets taken out of context
in what I call the "highlighter version,"
which is the one favored
by both Muslim fundamentalists
and anti-Muslim Islamophobes.
So this past spring,
as I was gearing up to begin writing
a biography of Muhammad,
I realized I needed to read
the Koran properly --
as properly as I could, that is.
My Arabic is reduced by now
to wielding a dictionary,
so I took four well-known translations
and decided to read them
side by side, verse by verse,
along with a transliteration
and the original seventh-century Arabic.
Now, I did have an advantage.
My last book was about the story
behind the Shi'a-Sunni split,
and for that, I'd worked closely
with the earliest Islamic histories,
so I knew the events
to which the Koran constantly refers,
its frame of reference.
I knew enough, that is, to know
that I'd be a tourist in the Koran --
an informed one,
an experienced one, even,
but still an outsider,
an agnostic Jew reading
someone else's holy book.
(Laughter)
So I read slowly.
(Laughter)
I'd set aside three weeks
for this project,
and that, I think,
is what is meant by "hubris" --
(Laughter)
because it turned out to be three months.
(Laughter)
I did resist the temptation
to skip to the back,
where the shorter and more
clearly mystical chapters are.
But every time I thought I was beginning
to get a handle on the Koran --
that feeling of "I get it now" --
it would slip away overnight,
and I'd come back in the morning,
wondering if I wasn't lost
in a strange land.
And yet, the terrain was very familiar.
The Koran declares that it comes
to renew the message
of the Torah and the Gospels.
So one-third of it reprises
the stories of Biblical figures
like Abraham, Moses, Joseph, Mary, Jesus.
God himself was utterly familiar
from his earlier manifestation as Yahweh,
jealously insisting on no other gods.
The presence of camels, mountains,
desert wells and springs
took me back to the year I spent
wandering the Sinai Desert.
And then there was the language,
the rhythmic cadence of it,
reminding me of evenings spent
listening to Bedouin elders
recite hours-long narrative poems
entirely from memory.
And I began to grasp why it's said
that the Koran is really
the Koran only in Arabic.
Take the Fatihah,
the seven-verse opening chapter
that is the Lord's Prayer
and the Shema Yisrael of Islam combined.
It's just 29 words in Arabic,
but anywhere from 65 to 72 in translation.
And yet the more you add,
the more seems to go missing.
The Arabic has an incantatory,
almost hypnotic quality
that begs to be heard rather than read,
felt more than analyzed.
It wants to be chanted out loud,
to sound its music in the ear
and on the tongue.
So the Koran in English
is a kind of shadow of itself,
or as Arthur Arberry called his version,
"an interpretation."
But all is not lost in translation.
As the Koran promises,
patience is rewarded,
and there are many surprises --
a degree of environmental
awareness, for instance,
and of humans as mere stewards
of God's creation,
unmatched in the Bible.
And where the Bible is addressed
exclusively to men,
using the second-
and third-person masculine,
the Koran includes women --
talking, for instance,
of believing men and believing women,
honorable men and honorable women.
Or take the infamous verse
about killing the unbelievers.
Yes, it does say that,
but in a very specific context:
the anticipated conquest
of the sanctuary city of Mecca,
where fighting was usually forbidden.
And the permission comes
hedged about with qualifiers.
Not "You must kill unbelievers in Mecca,"
but you can, you are allowed to,
but only after a grace period is over,
and only if there's no other
pact in place,
and only if they try to stop
you getting to the Kaaba,
and only if they attack you first.
And even then -- God is merciful;
forgiveness is supreme --
and so, essentially,
better if you don't.
(Laughter)
This was perhaps the biggest surprise --
how flexible the Koran is,
at least in minds that are not
fundamentally inflexible.
"Some of these verses
are definite in meaning," it says,
"and others are ambiguous."
The perverse at heart
will seek out the ambiguities,
trying to create discord
by pinning down meanings of their own.
Only God knows the true meaning.
The phrase "God is subtle"
appears again and again,
and indeed, the whole
of the Koran is far more subtle
than most of us have been led to believe.
As in, for instance, that little matter
of virgins and paradise.
Old-fashioned orientalism
comes into play here.
The word used four times is "houris,"
rendered as dark-eyed maidens
with swelling breasts,
or as fair, high-bosomed virgins.
Yet all there is in the original Arabic
is that one word: houris.
Not a swelling breast
or high bosom in sight.
(Laughter)
Now this may be a way of saying
"pure beings," like in angels,
or it may be like
the Greek "kouros" or "kore,"
an eternal youth.
But the truth is, nobody really knows.
And that's the point.
Because the Koran is quite clear
when it says that you'll be
"a new creation in paradise,"
and that you will be "recreated
in a form unknown to you,"
which seems to me
a far more appealing prospect
than a virgin.
(Laughter)
And that number 72 never appears.
There are no 72 virgins in the Koran.
That idea only came
into being 300 years later,
and most Islamic scholars
see it as the equivalent
of people with wings sitting on clouds
and strumming harps.
Paradise is quite the opposite.
It's not virginity;
it's fecundity;
it's plenty.
It's gardens watered by running streams.
Thank you.
(Applause)
I guess because I'm from Tanzania
I have a responsibility
to welcome all of you once again.
Thank you for coming.
So, first of all, before we start,
how many of you in the audience
have been in the past
a victim of this bug here?
We apologize on behalf
of all the mosquito catchers.
(Laughter)
Ladies and gentlemen,
imagine getting seven infectious
mosquito bites every day.
That's 2,555 infectious bites every year.
When I was in college,
I moved to the Kilombero River valley
in the southeastern part of Tanzania.
This is historically
one of the most malarious zones
in the world at that time.
Life here was difficult.
In its later stages
malaria manifested with extreme seizures
locally known as degedege.
It's killed both women and men,
adults and children,
without mercy.
My home institution,
Ifakara Health Institute,
began in this valley in the 1950s
to address priority health needs
for the local communities.
In fact, the name Ifakara
refers to a place you go to die,
which is a reflection
of what life used to be here
in the days before
organized public health care.
When I first moved here,
my primary role was to estimate
how much malaria transmission
was going on across the villages
and which mosquitoes
were transmitting the disease.
So my colleague and myself came
30 kilometers south
of Ifakara town across the river.
Every evening we went into the villages
with flashlights and siphons.
We rolled up our trousers,
and waited for mosquitoes
that were coming to bite us
so we could collect them
to check if they were carrying malaria.
(Laughter)
My colleague and myself
selected a household,
and we started inside and outside,
swapping positions every half hour.
And we did this for 12 hours every night
for 24 consecutive nights.
We slept for four hours every morning
and worked the rest of the day,
sorting mosquitoes, identifying them
and chopping off their heads
so they could be analyzed in the lab
to check if they were
carrying malaria parasites
in their blood mouthparts.
This way we were able to not only know
how much malaria was going on here
but also which mosquitoes
were carrying this malaria.
We were also able to know
whether malaria was mostly
inside houses or outside houses.
Today, ladies and gentlemen,
I still catch mosquitoes for a living.
But I do this mostly to improve
people's lives and well-being.
This has been called by some people
the most dangerous animal on earth --
which unfortunately is true.
But what do we really
know about mosquitoes?
It turns out we actually know very little.
Consider the fact that at the moment
our best practice against malaria
are bednets --
insecticide treated bednets.
We know now that across Africa
you have widespread resistance
to insecticides.
And these are the same insecticides,
the pyrethroid class,
that are put on these bednets.
We know now that these bednets
protect you from bites
but only minimally kill
the mosquitoes that they should.
What it means is that we've got to do more
to be able to get to zero.
And that's part of our duty.
At Ifakara Health Institute
we focus very much
on the biology of the mosquito,
and we try to do this
so we can identify new opportunities.
A new approach.
New ways to try and get new options
that we can use together
with things such as bednets
to be able to get to zero.
And I'm going to share
with you a few examples
of the things that
my colleagues and myself do.
Take this, for example.
Mosquitoes breed in small pools of water.
Not all of them are easy to find --
they can be scattered across villages,
they can be as small as hoofprints.
They can be behind your house
or far from your house.
And so, if you wanted
to control mosquito larvae,
it can actually be
quite difficult to get them.
What my colleagues
and I have decided to do
is to think about what if
we used mosquitoes themselves
to carry the insecticides
from a place of our choice
to their own breeding habitats
so that whichever eggs
they lay there shall not survive.
This is Dickson Lwetoijera.
This is my colleague
who runs this show at Ifakara.
And he has demonstrated cleverly
that you can actually get mosquitoes
to come to the place
where they normally come to get blood
to pick up a dose
of sterilants or insecticide,
carry this back
to their own breeding habitat
and kill all their progeny.
And we have demonstrated
that you can do this
and crush populations very, very rapidly.
This is beautiful.
This is our mosquito city.
It is the largest mosquito farm
available in the world
for malaria research.
Here we have large-scale self-sustaining
colonies of malaria mosquitoes
that we rear in these facilities.
Of course, they are disease-free.
But what these systems allow us to do
is to introduce new tools
and test them immediately,
very quickly,
and see if we can crush these populations
or control them in some way.
And my colleagues have demonstrated
that if you just put
two or three positions
where mosquitoes can go
pick up these lethal substances,
we can crush these colonies
in just three months.
That's autodissemination, as we call it.
But what if we could use
the mosquitoes' sexual behavior
to also control them?
So, first of all I would like to tell you
that actually mosquitoes mate
in what we call swarms.
Male mosquitoes usually congregate
in clusters around the horizon,
usually after sunset.
The males go there for a dance,
the females fly into that dance
and select a male mosquito
of their choice,
usually the best-looking
male in their view.
They clump together
and fall down onto the floor.
If you watch this, it's beautiful.
It's a fantastic phenomenon.
This is where our mosquito-catching
work gets really interesting.
What we have seen, when we go
swarm hunting in the villages,
is that these swarm locations
tend to be at exactly the same location
every day, every week, every month,
year in, year out.
They start at exactly
the same time of the evening,
and they are at exactly
the same locations.
What does this tell us?
It means that if we can map
all these locations across villages,
we could actually
crush these populations
by just a single blow.
Kind of, you know, bomb-spray them
or nuke them out.
And that is what we try to do
with young men and women
across the villages.
We organize these crews, teach them
how to identify the swarms,
and spray them out.
My colleagues and I believe
we have a new window
to get mosquitoes out of the valley.
But perhaps the fact that mosquitoes
eat blood, human blood,
is the reason they are
the most dangerous animal on earth.
But think about it this way --
mosquitoes actually smell you.
And they have developed
incredible sensory organs.
They can smell from as far
sometimes as 100 meters away.
And when they get closer,
they can even tell the difference
between two family members.
They know who you are
based on what you produce
from your breath, skin,
sweat and body odor.
What we have done at Ifakara
is to identify what it is in your skin,
your body, your sweat or your breath
that these mosquitoes like.
Once we identified these substances,
we created a concoction,
kind of a mixture,
a blend of synthetic substances
that are reminiscent
of what you produce from your body.
And we made a synthetic blend
that was attracting three to five times
more mosquitoes than a human being.
What can you do with this?
You put in a trap, lure a lot
of mosquitoes and you kill them, right?
And of course, you can also
use it for surveillance.
At Ifakara
we wish to expand our knowledge
on the biology of the mosquito;
to control many other diseases,
including, of course, the malaria,
but also those other diseases
that mosquitoes transmit
like dengue, Chikungunya and Zika virus.
And this is why my colleagues,
for example --
we have looked at the fact
that some mosquitoes
like to bite you on the leg region.
And we've now created
these mosquito repellent sandals
that tourists and locals can wear
when they're coming.
And you don't get bitten --
this gives you 'round the clock protection
until the time you go under your bednet.
(Applause)
My love-hate relationship
with mosquitoes continues.
(Laughter)
And it's going to go
a long way, I can see.
But that's OK.
WHO has set a goal of 2030
to eliminate malaria from 35 countries.
The African Union has set a goal
of 2030 to eliminate malaria
from the continent.
At Ifakara we are firmly
behind these goals.
And we've put together
a cohort of young scientists,
male and female,
who are champions,
who are interested in coming together
to make this vision come true.
They do what they can
to make it work.
And we are supporting them.
We are here to make sure
that these dreams come true.
Ladies and gentlemen,
even if it doesn't happen in our lifetime,
even if it doesn't happen
before you and me go away,
I believe that your child and my child
shall inherit a world
free of malaria transmitting mosquitoes
and free of malaria.
Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen.
(Applause)
Thank you.
Kelo Kubu: OK, Fredros.
Let's talk about CRISPR for a bit.
(Laughter)
It's taken the world by storm,
it promises to do amazing things.
What do you think of scientists
using CRISPR to kill off mosquitoes?
Fredros Okumu: To answer this question,
let's start from what the problem is.
First of all, we're talking
about a disease that still kills --
according to the latest figures
we have from WHO --
429,000 people.
Most of these are African children.
Of course, we've made progress,
there are countries that have achieved
up to 50-60 percent reduction
in malaria burden.
But we still have to do more
to get to zero.
There is already proof of principle
that gene-editing techniques,
such as CRISPR,
can be used effectively
to transform mosquitoes so that
either they do not transmit malaria --
we call this population alteration --
or that they no longer exist,
population suppression.
This is already proven in the lab.
There is also modeling work
that has demonstrated
that even if you were to release
just a small number of these
genetically modified mosquitoes,
that you can actually achieve
elimination very, very quickly.
So, CRISPR and tools like this
offer us some real opportunities --
real-life opportunities
to have high-impact interventions
that we can use
in addition to what we have now
to eventually go to zero.
This is important.
Now, of course people always ask us --
which is a common question,
I guess you're going
to ask this as well --
"What happens if you
eliminate mosquitoes?"
KK: I won't ask then, you answer.
FO: OK. In respect to this,
I would just like to remind my colleagues
that we have 3,500
mosquito species in this world.
Maybe more than that.
About 400 of these are Anophelenes,
and only about 70 of them
have any capacity to transmit malaria.
In Africa, we're having to deal with
three or four of these as the major guys.
They carry most -- like 99 percent
of all the malaria we have.
If we were to go out
with gene editing like CRISPR,
if we were to go out
with gene drives to control malaria,
we would be going after only one or two.
I don't see a diversity problem with that.
But that's personal view.
I think it's OK.
And remember, by the way,
all these years we've been trying
to eliminate these mosquitoes effectively
by spraying them -- our colleagues
in America have sprayed with --
really bomb-spraying
these insects out of the villages.
In Africa we do a lot
of household spraying.
All these are aimed
solely at killing the mosquitoes.
So there's really no problem
if we had a new tool.
But having said that, I have to say
we also have to be
very, very responsible here.
So there's the regulatory side,
and we have to partner with our regulators
and make sure that everything
that we do is done correctly,
is done responsibly
and that we also have to do
independent risk assessments,
to just make sure
that all these processes
do not fall into the wrong hands.
Thank you very much.
KK: Thank you.
(Applause)
Last year at TED I gave an introduction to the LHC.
And I promised to come back and give you an update
on how that machine worked.
So this is it. And for those of you that weren't there,
the LHC is the largest scientific experiment ever attempted --
27 kilometers in circumference.
Its job is to recreate the conditions
that were present less than a billionth of a second after the universe began,
up to 600 million times a second.
It's nothing if not ambitious.
This is the machine below Geneva.
We take the pictures of those mini-Big Bangs inside detectors.
This is the one I work on. It's called the ATLAS detector --
44 meters wide, 22 meters in diameter.
Spectacular picture here of ATLAS under construction
so you can see the scale.
On the 10th of September last year we turned the machine on for the first time.
And this picture was taken by ATLAS.
It caused immense celebration in the control room.
It's a picture of the first beam particle
going all the way around the LHC,
colliding with a piece of the LHC deliberately,
and showering particles into the detector.
In other words, when we saw that picture on September 10th
we knew the machine worked,
which is a great triumph.
I don't know whether this got the biggest cheer,
or this, when someone went onto Google
and saw the front page was like that.
It means we made cultural impact
as well as scientific impact.
About a week later we had a problem with the machine,
related actually to these bits of wire here -- these gold wires.
Those wires carry 13 thousand amps
when the machine is working in full power.
Now the engineers amongst you will look at them and say,
"No they don't. They're small wires."
They can do that because
when they are very cold they are what's called superconducting wire.
So at minus 271 degrees,
colder than the space between the stars,
those wires can take that current.
In one of the joints between over 9,000 magnets in LHC,
there was a manufacturing defect.
So the wire heated up slightly,
and its 13,000 amps suddenly encountered electrical resistance.
This was the result.
Now that's more impressive
when you consider those magnets weigh over 20 tons,
and they moved about a foot.
So we damaged about 50 of the magnets.
We had to take them out, which we did.
We reconditioned them all, fixed them.
They're all on their way back underground now.
By the end of March the LHC will be intact again.
We will switch it on,
and we expect to take data in June or July,
and continue with our quest to find out
what the building blocks of the universe are.
Now of course, in a way
those accidents reignite the debate
about the value of science and engineering at the edge. It's easy to refute.
I think that the fact that it's so difficult,
the fact that we're overreaching, is the value of things like the LHC.
I will leave the final word to an English scientist, Humphrey Davy,
who, I suspect,
when defending his protege's useless experiments --
his protege was Michael Faraday --
said this, "Nothing is so dangerous
to the progress of the human mind
than to assume that our views of science are ultimate,
that there are no mysteries in nature,
that our triumphs are complete, and that
there are no new worlds to conquer."
Thank you.
(Applause)
I come from Lebanon,
and I believe that running
can change the world.
I know what I have just said
is simply not obvious.
You know, Lebanon as a country
has been once destroyed
by a long and bloody civil war.
Honestly, I don't know
why they call it civil war
when there is nothing civil about it.
With Syria to the north,
Israel and Palestine to the south,
and our government
even up till this moment
is still fragmented and unstable.
For years, the country has been divided
between politics and religion.
However, for one day a year,
we truly stand united,
and that's when the marathon takes place.
I used to be a marathon runner.
Long distance running
was not only good for my well-being
but it helped me meditate and dream big.
So the longer distances I ran,
the bigger my dreams became.
Until one fateful morning,
and while training, I was hit by a bus.
I nearly died, was in a coma,
stayed at the hospital for two years,
and underwent 36 surgeries
to be able to walk again.
As soon as I came out of my coma,
I realized that I was no longer
the same runner I used to be,
so I decided, if I couldn't run myself,
I wanted to make sure that others could.
So out of my hospital bed,
I asked my husband to start taking notes,
and a few months later,
the marathon was born.
Organizing a marathon
as a reaction to an accident
may sound strange,
but at that time, even during
my most vulnerable condition,
I needed to dream big.
I needed something
to take me out of my pain,
an objective to look forward to.
I didn't want to pity myself,
nor to be pitied,
and I thought by organizing
such a marathon,
I'll be able to pay back to my community,
build bridges with the outside world,
and invite runners to come to Lebanon
and run under the umbrella of peace.
Organizing a marathon in Lebanon
is definitely not like organizing
one in New York.
How do you introduce
the concept of running
to a nation that is constantly
at the brink of war?
How do you ask those
who were once fighting
and killing each other
to come together and run
next to each other?
More than that, how do you convince people
to run a distance of 26.2 miles
at a time they were not even familiar
with the word "marathon"?
So we had to start from scratch.
For almost two years,
we went all over the country
and even visited remote villages.
I personally met with people
from all walks of life --
mayors, NGOs, schoolchildren,
politicians, militiamen,
people from mosques, churches,
the president of the country,
even housewives.
I learned one thing:
When you walk the talk,
people believe you.
Many were touched by my personal story,
and they shared their stories in return.
It was honesty and transparency
that brought us together.
We spoke one common language
to each other,
and that was from one human to another.
Once that trust was built,
everybody wanted
to be part of the marathon
to show the world the true colors
of Lebanon and the Lebanese
and their desire to live
in peace and harmony.
In October 2003, over 6,000 runners
from 49 different nationalities
came to the start line, all determined,
and when the gunfire went off,
this time it was a signal
to run in harmony,
for a change.
The marathon grew.
So did our political problems.
But for every disaster we had,
the marathon found ways
to bring people together.
In 2005, our prime minister
was assassinated,
and the country came
to a complete standstill,
so we organized a five-kilometer
United We Run campaign.
Over 60,000 people came to the start line,
all wearing white T-shirts
with no political slogans.
That was a turning point for the marathon,
where people started
looking at it as a platform
for peace and unity.
Between 2006 up to 2009,
our country, Lebanon,
went through unstable years,
invasions, and more assassinations
that brought us close to a civil war.
The country was divided again,
so much that our parliament resigned,
we had no president for a year,
and no prime minister.
But we did have a marathon.
(Applause)
So through the marathon, we learned
that political problems can be overcome.
When the opposition party decided
to shut down part of the city center,
we negotiated alternative routes.
Government protesters
became sideline cheerleaders.
They even hosted juice stations.
(Laughter)
You know, the marathon
has really become one of its kind.
It gained credibility
from both the Lebanese
and the international community.
Last November 2012, over 33,000 runners
from 85 different nationalities
came to the start line,
but this time, they challenged
a very stormy and rainy weather.
The streets were flooded,
but people didn't want to miss out
on the opportunity of being part
of such a national day.
BMA has expanded.
We include everyone:
the young, the elderly,
the disabled, the mentally challenged,
the blind, the elite, the amateur runners,
even moms with their babies.
Themes have included
runs for the environment,
breast cancer, for the love
of Lebanon, for peace,
or just simply to run.
The first annual all-women-and-girls
race for empowerment,
which is one of its kind in the region,
has just taken place only a few weeks ago,
with 4,512 women,
including the first lady,
and this is only the beginning.
Thank you.
(Applause)
BMA has supported charities and volunteers
who have helped reshape Lebanon,
raising funds for their causes
and encouraging others to give.
The culture of giving and doing good
has become contagious.
Stereotypes have been broken.
Change-makers and future leaders
have been created.
I believe these are the building blocks
for future peace.
BMA has become such a respected
event in the region
that government officials in the region,
like Iraq, Egypt and Syria,
have asked the organization to help them
structure a similar sporting event.
We are now one of the largest
running events in the Middle East,
but most importantly,
it is a platform for hope and cooperation
in an ever-fragile
and unstable part of the world.
From Boston to Beirut, we stand as one.
(Applause)
After 10 years in Lebanon,
from national marathons
or from national events
to smaller regional races,
we've seen that people want
to run for a better future.
After all, peacemaking is not a sprint.
It is more of a marathon.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Server: May I help you, sir?
Customer: Uh, let's see.

Customer: I'd like a RAM sandwich
and a glass of your finest Code 39.
Server: Would you like any desserts, sir?
Our special is tracking cookie.
Customer: I'd like a batch of some

Maya Penn: I've been drawing ever
since I could hold a crayon,
and I've been making animated flip books
since I was three years old.
At that age, I also learned
about what an animator was.
There was a program on TV about jobs
most kids don't know about.
When I understood that an animator
makes the cartoons I saw on TV,
I immediately said, "That's what I want to be."
I don't know if I said it mentally or out loud,
but that was a greatly defining moment in my life.
Animation and art has always been my first love.
It was my love for technology that sparked the idea
for "Malicious Dishes."
There was a virus on my computer,
and I was trying to get rid of it,
and all of a sudden, I just thought,
what if viruses have their own
little world inside the computer?
Maybe a restaurant where they meet up
and do virusy things?
And thus, "Malicious Dishes" was born.
At four years old, my dad showed me
how to take apart a computer
and put it back together again.
That started my love for technology.
I built my first website myself in HTML,
and I'm learning JavaScript and Python.
I'm also working on an animated series
called "The Pollinators."
It's about bees and other
pollinators in our environment
and why they're so important.
If plants aren't pollinated by the pollinators,
then all creatures, including ourselves,
that depend on these plants, would starve.
So I decided to take these cool creatures
and make a superhero team.
(Applause)
(Foot stomp)
(Music)
(Roar)
Pollinator: Deforestsaurus! I should have known!
I need to call on the rest of the Pollinators!
(Music)
Thank you. (Applause)
All of my animations start with ideas,
but what are ideas?
Ideas can spark a movement.
Ideas are opportunities and innovation.
Ideas truly are what make the world go round.
If it wasn't for ideas, we wouldn't be
where we are now with technology, medicine,
art, culture, and how we even live our lives.
At eight years old, I took my ideas
and started my own business called Maya's Ideas,
and my nonprofit, Maya's Ideas for the Planet.
(Laughter)
And I make eco-friendly clothing and accessories.
I'm 13 now, and although I started my business
in 2008,
my artistic journey started way before then.
I was greatly influenced by art, and I wanted to
incorporate it in everything I did, even my business.
I would find different fabrics around the house,
and say, &amp;quot;This could be a scarf or a hat,&amp;quot;
and I had all these ideas for designs.
I noticed when I wore my creations,
people would stop me and say,
"Wow, that's really cute. Where can I get one?"
And I thought, I can start my own business.
Now I didn't have any business plans
at only eight years old.
I only knew I wanted to make pretty creations
that were safe for the environment
and I wanted to give back.
My mom taught me how to sew,
and on my back porch, I would sit and make
little headbands out of ribbon,
and I would write down the names
and the price of each item.
I started making more items like hats,
scarves and bags.
Soon, my items began selling all over the world,
and I had customers in Denmark, Italy, Australia,
Canada and more.
Now, I had a lot to learn about my business,
like branding and marketing,
staying engaged with my customers,
and seeing what sold the most and the least.
Soon, my business really started to take off.
Then one day, Forbes magazine 
contacted me when I was 10 years old.
(Laughter)
They wanted to feature me and my company
in their article.
Now a lot of people ask me,
why is your business eco-friendly?
I've had a passion for protecting the environment
and its creatures since I was little.
My parents taught me at an early age
about giving back and being a
good steward to the environment.
I heard about how the dyes in some clothing
or the process of even making the items
was harmful to the people and the planet,
so I started doing my own research,
and I discovered that even
after dyeing has being completed,
there is a waste issue that gives a negative impact
on the environment.
For example, the grinding of materials,
or the dumping of dried powder materials.
These actions can pollute the air,
making it toxic to anyone or anything that inhales it.
So when I started my business,
I knew two things:
All of my items had to be eco-friendly,
and 10 to 20 percent of the profits I made
went to local and global charities
and environmental organizations.
(Applause)
I feel I'm part of the new wave of entrepreneurs
that not only seeks to have a successful business,
but also a sustainable future.
I feel that I can meet the needs of my customers
without compromising the
ability of future generations
to live in a greener tomorrow.
We live in a big, diverse and beautiful world,
and that makes me even more passionate to save it.
But it's never enough to just
to get it through your heads
about the things that are happening in our world.
It takes to get it through your hearts,
because when you get it through your heart,
that is when movements are sparked.
That is when opportunities
and innovation are created,
and that is why ideas come to life.
Thank you, and peace and blessings.
(Applause)
Thank you. (Applause)
Pat Mitchell: So, you heard Maya talk about
the amazing parents who are behind
this incredible woman. Where are they?
Please, Mr. and Mrs. Penn. Would you just -- Ah!
(Applause)
I'm going to speak today about the relationship
between science and human values.
Now, it's generally understood that
questions of morality --
questions of good and evil and right and wrong --
are questions about which science officially has no opinion.
It's thought that science can help us
get what we value,
but it can never tell us what we ought to value.
And, consequently, most people -- I think most people
probably here -- think that science will never answer
the most important questions in human life:
questions like, "What is worth living for?"
"What is worth dying for?"
"What constitutes a good life?"
So, I'm going to argue
that this is an illusion -- that the separation between
science and human values is an illusion --
and actually quite a dangerous one
at this point in human history.
Now, it's often said that science
cannot give us a foundation for morality and human values,
because science deals with facts,
and facts and values seem to belong to different spheres.
It's often thought that there's no description
of the way the world is
that can tell us how the world ought to be.
But I think this is quite clearly untrue.
Values are a certain kind of fact.
They are facts about the well-being of conscious creatures.
Why is it that we don't have ethical obligations toward rocks?
Why don't we feel compassion for rocks?
It's because we don't think rocks can suffer. And if we're more
concerned about our fellow primates
than we are about insects, as indeed we are,
it's because we think they're exposed to a greater range
of potential happiness and suffering.
Now, the crucial thing to notice here
is that this is a factual claim:
This is something that we could be right or wrong about. And if we
have misconstrued the relationship between biological complexity
and the possibilities of experience
well then we could be wrong about the inner lives of insects.
And there's no notion,
no version of human morality
and human values that I've ever come across
that is not at some point reducible
to a concern about conscious experience
and its possible changes.
Even if you get your values from religion,
even if you think that good and evil ultimately
relate to conditions after death --
either to an eternity of happiness with God
or an eternity of suffering in hell --
you are still concerned about consciousness and its changes.
And to say that such changes can persist after death
is itself a factual claim,
which, of course, may or may not be true.
Now, to speak about the conditions of well-being
in this life, for human beings,
we know that there is a continuum of such facts.
We know that it's possible to live in a failed state,
where everything that can go wrong does go wrong --
where mothers cannot feed their children,
where strangers cannot find the basis for peaceful collaboration,
where people are murdered indiscriminately.
And we know that it's possible to move along this continuum
towards something quite a bit more idyllic,
to a place where a conference like this is even conceivable.
And we know -- we know --
that there are right and wrong answers
to how to move in this space.
Would adding cholera to the water be a good idea?
Probably not.
Would it be a good idea for everyone to believe in the evil eye,
so that when bad things happened to them
they immediately blame their neighbors? Probably not.
There are truths to be known
about how human communities flourish,
whether or not we understand these truths.
And morality relates to these truths.
So, in talking about values we are talking about facts.
Now, of course our situation in the world can be understood at many levels --
from the level of the genome
on up to the level of economic systems
and political arrangements.
But if we're going to talk about human well-being
we are, of necessity, talking about the human brain.
Because we know that our experience of the world and of ourselves within it
is realized in the brain --
whatever happens after death.
Even if the suicide bomber does get 72 virgins in the afterlife,
in this life, his personality --
his rather unfortunate personality --
is the product of his brain.
So the contributions of culture --
if culture changes us, as indeed it does,
it changes us by changing our brains.
And so therefore whatever cultural variation there is
in how human beings flourish
can, at least in principle, be understood
in the context of a maturing science of the mind --
neuroscience, psychology, etc.
So, what I'm arguing is that
value's reduced to facts --
to facts about the conscious experience
of conscious beings.
And we can therefore visualize a space
of possible changes in the experience of these beings.
And I think of this as kind of a moral landscape,
with peaks and valleys that correspond
to differences in the well-being of conscious creatures,
both personal and collective.
And one thing to notice is that perhaps
there are states of human well-being
that we rarely access, that few people access.
And these await our discovery.
Perhaps some of these states can be appropriately called
mystical or spiritual.
Perhaps there are other states that we can't access
because of how our minds are structured
but other minds possibly could access them.
Now, let me be clear about what I'm not saying. I'm not saying
that science is guaranteed to map this space,
or that we will have scientific answers to every
conceivable moral question.
I don't think, for instance, that you will one day consult
a supercomputer to learn whether you should have a second child,
or whether we should bomb Iran's nuclear facilities,
or whether you can deduct the full cost of TED as a business expense.
(Laughter)
But if questions affect human well-being
then they do have answers, whether or not we can find them.
And just admitting this --
just admitting that there are right and wrong answers
to the question of how humans flourish --
will change the way we talk about morality,
and will change our expectations
of human cooperation in the future.
For instance, there are 21 states in our country
where corporal punishment in the classroom is legal,
where it is legal for a teacher to beat a child with a wooden board, hard,
and raising large bruises and blisters and even breaking the skin.
And hundreds of thousands of children, incidentally,
are subjected to this every year.
The locations of these enlightened districts, I think, will fail to surprise you.
We're not talking about Connecticut.
And the rationale for this behavior is explicitly religious.
The creator of the universe himself
has told us not to spare the rod,
lest we spoil the child --
this is in Proverbs 13 and 20, and I believe, 23.
But we can ask the obvious question:
Is it a good idea, generally speaking,
to subject children to pain
and violence and public humiliation
as a way of encouraging healthy emotional development
and good behavior?
(Laughter)
Is there any doubt
that this question has an answer,
and that it matters?
Now, many of you might worry
that the notion of well-being is truly undefined,
and seemingly perpetually open to be re-construed.
And so, how therefore can there be an
objective notion of well-being?
Well, consider by analogy, the concept of physical health.
The concept of physical health is undefined.
As we just heard from Michael Specter, it has changed over the years.
When this statue was carved
the average life expectancy was probably 30.
It's now around 80 in the developed world.
There may come a time when we meddle with our genomes
in such a way that not being able to run a marathon
at age 200 will be considered a profound disability.
People will send you donations when you're in that condition.
(Laughter)
Notice that the fact that the concept of health
is open, genuinely open for revision,
does not make it vacuous.
The distinction between a healthy person
and a dead one
is about as clear and consequential as any we make in science.
Another thing to notice is there may be many peaks on the moral landscape:
There may be equivalent ways to thrive;
there may be equivalent ways to organize a human society
so as to maximize human flourishing.
Now, why wouldn't this
undermine an objective morality?
Well think of how we talk about food:
I would never be tempted to argue to you
that there must be one right food to eat.
There is clearly a range of materials
that constitute healthy food.
But there's nevertheless a clear distinction
between food and poison.
The fact that there are many right answers
to the question, "What is food?"
does not tempt us
to say that there are no truths to be known about human nutrition.
Many people worry
that a universal morality would require
moral precepts that admit of no exceptions.
So, for instance, if it's really wrong to lie,
it must always be wrong to lie,
and if you can find an exception,
well then there's no such thing as moral truth.
Why would we think this?
Consider, by analogy, the game of chess.
Now, if you're going to play good chess,
a principle like, "Don't lose your Queen,"
is very good to follow.
But it clearly admits some exceptions.
There are moments when losing your Queen is a brilliant thing to do.
There are moments when it is the only good thing you can do.
And yet, chess is a domain of perfect objectivity.
The fact that there are exceptions here does not
change that at all.
Now, this brings us to the sorts of moves
that people are apt to make in the moral sphere.
Consider the great problem of women's bodies:
What to do about them?
Well this is one thing you can do about them:
You can cover them up.
Now, it is the position, generally speaking, of our intellectual community
that while we may not like this,
we might think of this as "wrong"
in Boston or Palo Alto,
who are we to say
that the proud denizens of an ancient culture
are wrong to force their wives and daughters
to live in cloth bags?
And who are we to say, even, that they're wrong
to beat them with lengths of steel cable,
or throw battery acid in their faces
if they decline the privilege of being smothered in this way?
Well, who are we not to say this?
Who are we to pretend
that we know so little about human well-being
that we have to be non-judgmental about a practice like this?
I'm not talking about voluntary wearing of a veil --
women should be able to wear whatever they want, as far as I'm concerned.
But what does voluntary mean
in a community where,
when a girl gets raped,
her father's first impulse,
rather often, is to murder her out of shame?
Just let that fact detonate in your brain for a minute:
Your daughter gets raped,
and what you want to do is kill her.
What are the chances that represents
a peak of human flourishing?
Now, to say this is not to say that we have got the
perfect solution in our own society.
For instance,
this is what it's like to go to a newsstand almost anywhere
in the civilized world.
Now, granted, for many men
it may require a degree in philosophy to see something wrong with these images.
(Laughter)
But if we are in a reflective mood,
we can ask,
"Is this the perfect expression
of psychological balance
with respect to variables like youth and beauty and women's bodies?"
I mean, is this the optimal environment
in which to raise our children?
Probably not. OK, so perhaps there's some place
on the spectrum
between these two extremes
that represents a place of better balance.
(Applause)
Perhaps there are many such places --
again, given other changes in human culture
there may be many peaks on the moral landscape.
But the thing to notice is that there will be
many more ways not to be on a peak.
Now the irony, from my perspective,
is that the only people who seem to generally agree with me
and who think that there are right and wrong answers to moral questions
are religious demagogues of one form or another.
And of course they think they have right answers to moral questions
because they got these answers from a voice in a whirlwind,
not because they made an intelligent analysis of the causes
and condition of human and animal well-being.
In fact, the endurance of religion
as a lens through which most people view moral questions
has separated most moral talk
from real questions of human and animal suffering.
This is why we spend our time
talking about things like gay marriage
and not about genocide or nuclear proliferation
or poverty or any other hugely consequential issue.
But the demagogues are right about one thing: We need
a universal conception of human values.
Now, what stands in the way of this?
Well, one thing to notice is that we
do something different when talking about morality --
especially secular, academic, scientist types.
When talking about morality we value differences of opinion
in a way that we don't in any other area of our lives.
So, for instance the Dalai Lama gets up every morning
meditating on compassion,
and he thinks that helping other human beings is an integral component
of human happiness.
On the other hand, we have someone like Ted Bundy;
Ted Bundy was very fond of abducting and raping
and torturing and killing young women.
So, we appear to have a genuine difference of opinion
about how to profitably use one's time.
(Laughter)
Most Western intellectuals
look at this situation
and say, "Well, there's nothing for the Dalai Lama
to be really right about -- really right about --
or for Ted Bundy to be really wrong about
that admits of a real argument
that potentially falls within the purview of science.
He likes chocolate, he likes vanilla.
There's nothing that one should be able to say to the other
that should persuade the other."
Notice that we don't do this in science.
On the left you have Edward Witten.
He's a string theorist.
If you ask the smartest physicists around
who is the smartest physicist around,
in my experience half of them will say Ed Witten.
The other half will tell you they don't like the question.
(Laughter)
So, what would happen if I showed up at a physics conference
and said,"String theory is bogus.
It doesn't resonate with me. It's not how I chose to
view the universe at a small scale.
I'm not a fan."
(Laughter)
Well, nothing would happen because I'm not a physicist;
I don't understand string theory.
I'm the Ted Bundy of string theory.
(Laughter)
I wouldn't want to belong to any string theory club that would have me as a member.
But this is just the point.
Whenever we are talking about facts
certain opinions must be excluded.
That is what it is to have a domain of expertise.
That is what it is for knowledge to count.
How have we convinced ourselves
that in the moral sphere there is no such thing as moral expertise,
or moral talent, or moral genius even?
How have we convinced ourselves
that every opinion has to count?
How have we convinced ourselves
that every culture has a point of view
on these subjects worth considering?
Does the Taliban
have a point of view on physics
that is worth considering? No.
(Laughter)
How is their ignorance any less obvious
on the subject of human well-being?
(Applause)
So, this, I think, is what the world needs now.
It needs people like ourselves to admit
that there are right and wrong answers
to questions of human flourishing,
and morality relates
to that domain of facts.
It is possible
for individuals, and even for whole cultures,
to care about the wrong things,
which is to say that it's possible for them
to have beliefs and desires that reliably lead
to needless human suffering.
Just admitting this will transform our discourse about morality.
We live in a world in which
the boundaries between nations mean less and less,
and they will one day mean nothing.
We live in a world filled with destructive technology,
and this technology cannot be uninvented;
it will always be easier
to break things than to fix them.
It seems to me, therefore, patently obvious
that we can no more
respect and tolerate
vast differences in notions of human well-being
than we can respect or tolerate vast differences
in the notions about how disease spreads,
or in the safety standards of buildings and airplanes.
We simply must converge
on the answers we give to the most important questions in human life.
And to do that, we have to admit that these questions have answers.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
Chris Anderson: So, some combustible material there.
Whether in this audience or people elsewhere in the world,
hearing some of this, may well be doing the
screaming-with-rage thing, after as well, some of them.
Language seems to be really important here.
When you're talking about the veil,
you're talking about women dressed in cloth bags.
I've lived in the Muslim world, spoken with a lot of Muslim women.
And some of them would say something else. They would say,
"No, you know, this is a celebration
of female specialness,
it helps build that and it's a result of the fact that" --
and this is arguably a sophisticated psychological view --
"that male lust is not to be trusted."
I mean, can you engage in a conversation
with that kind of woman without seeming kind of cultural imperialist?
Sam Harris: Yeah, well I think I tried to broach this in a sentence,
watching the clock ticking,
but the question is:
What is voluntary in a context
where men have certain expectations,
and you're guaranteed to be treated in a certain way
if you don't veil yourself?
And so, if anyone in this room
wanted to wear a veil,
or a very funny hat, or tattoo their face --
I think we should be free to voluntarily do whatever we want,
but we have to be honest about
the constraints that these women are placed under.
And so I think we shouldn't be so eager
to always take their word for it,
especially when it's 120 degrees out
and you're wearing a full burqa.
CA: A lot of people want to believe in this
concept of moral progress.
But can you reconcile that?
I think I understood you to say that you could
reconcile that with a world that doesn't become
one dimensional, where we all have to think the same.
Paint your picture of what
rolling the clock 50 years forward,
100 years forward, how you would like to think of
the world, balancing moral progress
with richness.
SH: Well, I think once you admit
that we are on the path toward understanding our minds
at the level of the brain in some important detail,
then you have to admit
that we are going to understand all of the positive
and negative qualities
of ourselves in much greater detail.
So, we're going to understand positive social emotion
like empathy and compassion,
and we're going to understand the factors
that encourage it -- whether they're genetic,
whether they're how people talk to one another,
whether they're economic systems,
and insofar as we begin to shine light on that
we are inevitably going to converge
on that fact space.
So, everything is not going to be up for grabs.
It's not going to be like
veiling my daughter from birth
is just as good as teaching her
to be confident and well-educated
in the context of men who do desire women.
I mean I don't think we need an NSF grant to know
that compulsory veiling is a bad idea --
but at a certain point
we're going to be able to scan the brains of everyone involved
and actually interrogate them.
Do people love their daughters
just as much in these systems?
And I think there are clearly right answers to that.
CA: And if the results come out that actually they do,
are you prepared to shift your instinctive current judgment
on some of these issues?
SH: Well yeah, modulo one obvious fact,
that you can love someone
in the context of a truly delusional belief system.
So, you can say like, "Because I knew my gay son
was going to go to hell if he found a boyfriend,
I chopped his head off. And that was the most compassionate thing I could do."
If you get all those parts aligned,
yes I think you could probably be feeling the emotion of love.
But again, then we have to talk about
well-being in a larger context.
It's all of us in this together,
not one man feeling ecstasy
and then blowing himself up on a bus.
CA: Sam, this is a conversation I would actually love to
continue for hours.
We don't have that, but maybe another time. Thank you for coming to TED.
SH: Really an honor. Thank you.
(Applause)
Paying close attention to something:
Not that easy, is it?
It's because our attention is pulled
in so many different directions at a time,
and it's in fact pretty impressive
if you can stay focused.
Many people think that attention
is all about what we are focusing on,
but it's also about what information
our brain is trying to filter out.
There are two ways
you direct your attention.
First, there's overt attention.
In overt attention,
you move your eyes towards something
in order to pay attention to it.
Then there's covert attention.
In covert attention,
you pay attention to something,
but without moving your eyes.
Think of driving for a second.
Your overt attention,
your direction of the eyes,
are in front,
but that's your covert attention
which is constantly scanning
the surrounding area,
where you don't actually look at them.
I'm a computational neuroscientist,
and I work on cognitive
brain-machine interfaces,
or bringing together
the brain and the computer.
I love brain patterns.
Brain patterns are important for us
because based on them
we can build models for the computers,
and based on these models
computers can recognize
how well our brain functions.
And if it doesn't function well,
then these computers themselves
can be used as assistive devices
for therapies.
But that also means something,
because choosing the wrong patterns
will give us the wrong models
and therefore the wrong therapies.
Right?
In case of attention,
the fact that we can
shift our attention not only by our eyes
but also by thinking --
that makes covert attention
an interesting model for computers.
So I wanted to know
what are the brainwave patterns
when you look overtly
or when you look covertly.
I set up an experiment for that.
In this experiment
there are two flickering squares,
one of them flickering
at a slower rate than the other one.
Depending on which of these flickers
you are paying attention to,
certain parts of your brain
will start resonating in the same rate
as that flickering rate.
So by analyzing your brain signals,
we can track where exactly
you are watching
or you are paying attention to.
So to see what happens in your brain
when you pay overt attention,
I asked people to look directly
in one of the squares
and pay attention to it.
In this case, not surprisingly,
we saw that these flickering squares
appeared in their brain signals
which was coming
from the back of their head,
which is responsible for the processing
of your visual information.
But I was really interested
to see what happens in your brain
when you pay covert attention.
So this time I asked people
to look in the middle of the screen
and without moving their eyes,
to pay attention
to either of these squares.
When we did that,
we saw that both of these flickering rates
appeared in their brain signals,
but interestingly,
only one of them,
which was paid attention to,
had stronger signals,
so there was something in the brain
which was handling this information
so that thing in the brain was basically
the activation of the frontal area.
The front part of your brain
is responsible
for higher cognitive functions as a human.
The frontal part,
it seems that it works as a filter
trying to let information come in
only from the right flicker
that you are paying attention to
and trying to inhibit the information
coming from the ignored one.
The filtering ability of the brain
is indeed a key for attention,
which is missing in some people,
for example in people with ADHD.
So a person with ADHD
cannot inhibit these distractors,
and that's why they can't focus
for a long time on a single task.
But what if this person
could play a specific computer game
with his brain connected to the computer,
and then train his own brain
to inhibit these distractors?
Well, ADHD is just one example.
We can use these cognitive
brain-machine interfaces
for many other cognitive fields.
It was just a few years ago
that my grandfather had a stroke,
and he lost complete ability to speak.
He could understand everybody,
but there was no way to respond,
even not writing
because he was illiterate.
So he passed away in silence.
I remember thinking at that time:
What if we could have a computer
which could speak for him?
Now, after years that I am in this field,
I can see that this might be possible.
Imagine if we can find brainwave patterns
when people think
about images or even letters,
like the letter A generates
a different brainwave pattern
than the letter B, and so on.
Could a computer one day
communicate for people who can't speak?
What if a computer
can help us understand
the thoughts of a person in a coma?
We are not there yet,
but pay close attention.
We will be there soon.
Thank you.
(Applause)
We grew up
interacting with the physical
objects around us.
There are an enormous number of them
that we use every day.
Unlike most of our computing devices,
these objects are much more fun to use.
When you talk about objects,
one other thing automatically
comes attached to that thing,
and that is gestures:
how we manipulate these objects,
how we use these objects in everyday life.
We use gestures not only to interact
with these objects,
but we also use them
to interact with each other.
A gesture of "Namaste!",
maybe, to respect someone, or maybe,
in India I don't need to teach
a kid that this means
"four runs" in cricket.
It comes as a part
of our everyday learning.
So, I am very interested,
from the beginning,
how our knowledge
about everyday objects and gestures,
and how we use these objects,
can be leveraged to our interactions
with the digital world.
Rather than using a keyboard and mouse,
why can I not use my computer
in the same way that I interact
in the physical world?
So, I started this exploration
around eight years back,
and it literally started
with a mouse on my desk.
Rather than using it for my computer,
I actually opened it.
Most of you might be aware
that, in those days,
the mouse used to come with a ball inside,
and there were two rollers
that actually guide the computer
where the ball is moving,
and, accordingly,
where the mouse is moving.
So, I was interested in these two rollers,
and I actually wanted more, so I borrowed
another mouse from a friend --
never returned to him --
and I now had four rollers.
Interestingly, what I did
with these rollers is,
basically, I took them off of these mouses
and then put them in one line.
It had some strings
and pulleys and some springs.
What I got is basically
a gesture-interface device
that actually acts
as a motion-sensing device
made for two dollars.
So, here, whatever movement
I do in my physical world
is actually replicated
inside the digital world
just using this small device
that I made, around eight years back,
in 2000.
Because I was interested
in integrating these two worlds,
I thought of sticky notes.
I thought, "Why can I not connect
the normal interface
of a physical sticky note
to the digital world?"
A message written
on a sticky note to my mom,
on paper,
can come to an SMS,
or maybe a meeting reminder
automatically syncs
with my digital calendar --
a to-do list that automatically
syncs with you.
But you can also search
in the digital world,
or maybe you can write a query, saying,
"What is Dr. Smith's address?"
and this small system
actually prints it out --
so it actually acts like a paper
input-output system,
just made out of paper.
In another exploration,
I thought of making a pen
that can draw in three dimensions.
So, I implemented this pen
that can help designers and architects
not only think in three dimensions,
but they can actually draw,
so that it's more intuitive
to use that way.
Then I thought,
"Why not make a Google Map,
but in the physical world?"
Rather than typing a keyword
to find something,
I put my objects on top of it.
If I put a boarding pass, it will show me
where the flight gate is.
A coffee cup will show
where you can find more coffee,
or where you can trash the cup.
So, these were some
of the earlier explorations I did
because the goal was to connect
these two worlds seamlessly.
Among all these experiments,
there was one thing in common:
I was trying to bring
a part of the physical world
to the digital world.
I was taking some part of the objects,
or any of the intuitiveness of real life,
and bringing them to the digital world,
because the goal was to make
our computing interfaces more intuitive.
But then I realized that we humans
are not actually interested in computing.
What we are interested in is information.
We want to know about things.
We want to know about
dynamic things going around.
So I thought, around last year --
in the beginning of the last year --
I started thinking, "Why can I not take
this approach in the reverse way?"
Maybe, "How about I take my digital world
and paint the physical world
with that digital information?"
Because pixels are actually, right now,
confined in these rectangular devices
that fit in our pockets.
Why can I not remove this confine
and take that to my everyday
objects, everyday life
so that I don't need
to learn the new language
for interacting with those pixels?
So, in order to realize this dream,
I actually thought of putting
a big-size projector on my head.
I think that's why this is called
a head-mounted projector, isn't it?
I took it very literally,
and took my bike helmet,
put a little cut over there so that
the projector actually fits nicely.
So now, what I can do --
I can augment the world around me
with this digital information.
But later,
I realized that I actually
wanted to interact
with those digital pixels, also.
So I put a small camera over there
that acts as a digital eye.
Later, we moved to a much better,
consumer-oriented pendant version of that,
that many of you now know
as the SixthSense device.
But the most interesting thing
about this particular technology
is that you can carry
your digital world with you
wherever you go.
You can start using any surface,
any wall around you,
as an interface.
The camera is actually tracking
all your gestures.
Whatever you're doing with your hands,
it's understanding that gesture.
And, actually, if you see,
there are some color markers
that in the beginning version
we are using with it.
You can start painting on any wall.
You stop by a wall,
and start painting on that wall.
But we are not only tracking
one finger, here.
We are giving you the freedom
of using all of both of your hands,
so you can actually use both of your hands
to zoom into or zoom out
of a map just by pinching all present.
The camera is actually doing --
just, getting all the images --
is doing the edge recognition
and also the color recognition
and so many other small algorithms
are going on inside.
So, technically,
it's a little bit complex,
but it gives you an output which is more
intuitive to use, in some sense.
But I'm more excited that you can
actually take it outside.
Rather than getting your camera
out of your pocket,
you can just do the gesture
of taking a photo,
and it takes a photo for you.
(Applause)
Thank you.
And later I can find a wall, anywhere,
and start browsing those photos
or maybe, "OK, I want to modify
this photo a little bit
and send it as an email to a friend."
So, we are looking for an era
where computing will actually merge
with the physical world.
And, of course,
if you don't have any surface,
you can start using your palm
for simple operations.
Here, I'm dialing a phone number
just using my hand.
The camera is actually not
only understanding your hand movements,
but, interestingly,
is also able to understand what objects
you are holding in your hand.
For example, in this case,
the book cover is matched
with so many thousands,
or maybe millions of books online,
and checking out which book it is.
Once it has that information,
it finds out more reviews about that,
or maybe New York Times
has a sound overview on that,
so you can actually hear,
on a physical book,
a review as sound.
(Video) Famous talk
at Harvard University --
This was Obama's visit last week to MIT.
(Video) And particularly I want
to thank two outstanding MIT --
Pranav Mistry: So, I was seeing
the live [video] of his talk,
outside, on just a newspaper.
Your newspaper will show you
live weather information
rather than having it updated.
You have to check your computer
in order to do that, right?
(Applause)
When I'm going back,
I can just use my boarding pass
to check how much my flight
has been delayed,
because at that particular time,
I'm not feeling like opening my iPhone,
and checking out a particular icon.
And I think this technology
will not only change the way --
(Laughter)
Yes.
It will change the way
we interact with people, also,
not only the physical world.
The fun part is, I'm going
to the Boston metro,
and playing a pong game inside the train
on the ground, right?
(Laughter)
And I think the imagination
is the only limit
of what you can think of
when this kind of technology
merges with real life.
But many of you argue, actually,
that all of our work is not
only about physical objects.
We actually do lots
of accounting and paper editing
and all those kinds of things;
what about that?
And many of you are excited
about the next-generation tablet computers
to come out in the market.
So, rather than waiting for that,
I actually made my own,
just using a piece of paper.
So, what I did here
is remove the camera --
All the webcam cameras have
a microphone inside the camera.
I removed the microphone from that,
and then just pinched that --
like I just made a clip
out of the microphone --
and clipped that to a piece of paper,
any paper that you found around.
So now the sound of the touch
is getting me when exactly
I'm touching the paper.
But the camera is actually tracking
where my fingers are moving.
You can of course watch movies.
(Video) Good afternoon.
My name is Russell,
and I am a Wilderness
Explorer in Tribe 54."
PM: And you can of course play games.
(Car engine)
Here, the camera is actually understanding
how you're holding the paper
and playing a car-racing game.
(Applause)
Many of you already must have
thought, OK, you can browse.
Yeah. Of course you can
browse to any websites
or you can do all sorts
of computing on a piece of paper
wherever you need it.
So, more interestingly,
I'm interested in how we can
take that in a more dynamic way.
When I come back to my desk,
I can just pinch that information
back to my desktop
so I can use my full-size computer.
(Applause)
And why only computers?
We can just play with papers.
Paper world is interesting to play with.
Here, I'm taking a part of a document,
and putting over here a second part
from a second place,
and I'm actually modifying the information
that I have over there.
Yeah. And I say, "OK, this looks nice,
let me print it out, that thing."
So I now have a print-out of that thing.
So the workflow is more intuitive,
the way we used to do it
maybe 20 years back,
rather than now switching
between these two worlds.
So, as a last thought,
I think that integrating
information to everyday objects
will not only help us to get rid
of the digital divide,
the gap between these two worlds,
but will also help us, in some way,
to stay human,
to be more connected
to our physical world.
And it will actually help us
not end up being machines
sitting in front of other machines.
That's all. Thank you.
(Applause)
Thank you.
(Applause)
Chris Anderson: So, Pranav,
first of all, you're a genius.
This is incredible, really.
What are you doing with this?
Is there a company being planned?
Or is this research forever, or what?
Pranav Mistry: So, there are
lots of companies,
sponsor companies of Media Lab
interested in taking this ahead
in one or another way.
Companies like mobile-phone operators
want to take this in a different way
than the NGOs in India,
thinking, "Why can we only
have 'Sixth Sense'?
We should have a 'Fifth Sense'
for missing-sense people who cannot speak.
This technology can be used for them
to speak out in a different way
maybe a speaker system."
CA: What are your own plans?
Are you staying at MIT,
or are you going to do
something with this?
PM: I'm trying to make this
more available to people
so that anyone can develop
their own SixthSense device,
because the hardware is actually
not that hard to manufacture
or hard to make your own.
We will provide all the open source
software for them,
maybe starting next month.
CA: Open source? Wow.
(Applause)
CA: Are you going to come back to India
with some of this, at some point?
PM: Yeah. Yes, yes, of course.
CA: What are your plans? MIT? India?
How are you going to split
your time going forward?
PM: There is a lot of energy here.
Lots of learning.
All of this work that you have seen
is all about my learning in India.
And now, if you see, it's more about
the cost-effectiveness:
this system costs you $300
compared to the $20,000 surface tables,
or anything like that.
Or maybe even the $2 mouse gesture system
at that time was costing around $5,000?
I showed that, at a conference,
to President Abdul Kalam, at that time,
and then he said, "OK, we should use this
in Bhabha Atomic Research Centre
for some use of that."
So I'm excited about how I can bring
the technology to the masses
rather than just keeping that technology
in the lab environment.
(Applause)
CA: Based on the people we've seen at TED,
I would say you're truly
one of the two or three
best inventors in the world right now.
It's an honor to have you at TED.
Thank you so much.
That's fantastic.
(Applause)
Right now is the most exciting time
to see new Indian art.
Contemporary artists in India are having a conversation with the world
like never before.
I thought it might be interesting, even for the many long-time
collectors here with us at TED, local collectors,
to have an outside view of 10 young Indian artists
I wish everyone at TED to know.
The first is Bharti Kher.
The central motif of Bharti's practice
is the ready-made store-bought bindi
that untold millions of Indian women apply to their foreheads,
every day, in an act closely associated with
the institution of marriage.
But originally the significance of the bindi
is to symbolize the third eye
between the spiritual world and the religious world.
Bharti seeks to liberate this everyday cliche, as she calls it,
by exploding it into something spectacular.
She also creates life-size fiberglass sculptures, often of animals,
which she then completely covers in bindis,
often with potent symbolism.
She says she first got started with
10 packets of bindis,
and then wondered what she could do with 10 thousand.
Our next artist, Balasubramaniam,
really stands at the crossroads of sculpture, painting and installation,
working wonders with fiberglass.
Since Bala himself will be speaking at TED
I won't spend too much time on him here today,
except to say that he really succeeds
at making the invisible visible.
Brooklyn-based Chitra Ganesh
is known for her digital collages,
using Indian comic books called amar chitra kathas
as her primary source material.
These comics are a fundamental way
that children, especially in the diaspora,
learn their religious and mythological folk tales.
I, for one, was steeped in these.
Chitra basically remixes and re-titles
these iconic images
to tease out some of the sexual and gender politics
embedded in these deeply influential comics.
And she uses this vocabulary in her installation work as well.
Jitish Kallat successfully practices across photography,
sculpture, painting and installation.
As you can see, he's heavily influenced
by graffiti and street art,
and his home city of Mumbai is an ever-present element in his work.
He really captures that sense of density
and energy which really characterizes modern urban Bombay.
He also creates phantasmagoric sculptures
made of bones from cast resin.
Here he envisions the carcass
of an autorickshaw he once witnessed burning in a riot.
This next artist, N.S. Harsha,
actually has a studio right here in Mysore.
He's putting a contemporary spin on the miniature tradition.
He creates these fine, delicate images
which he then repeats on a massive scale.
He uses scale to more and more spectacular effect,
whether on the roof of a temple in Singapore,
or in his increasingly ambitious installation work,
here with 192 functioning sewing machines,
fabricating the flags of every member of the United Nations.
Mumbai-based Dhruvi Acharya
builds on her love of comic books and street art
to comment on the roles and expectations
of modern Indian women.
She too mines the rich source material of amar chitra kathas,
but in a very different way than Chitra Ganesh.
In this particular work, she actually strips out the images
and leaves the actual text
to reveal something previously unseen, and provocative.
Raqib Shaw is Kolkata-born,
Kashmir-raised,
and London-trained.
He too is reinventing the miniature tradition.
He creates these opulent tableaus inspired by Hieronymus Bosch,
but also by the Kashmiri textiles of his youth.
He actually applies metallic industrial paints to his work
using porcupine quills to get this rich detailed effect.
I'm kind of cheating with this next artist
since Raqs Media Collective are really
three artists working together.
Raqs are probably the foremost practitioners
of multimedia art in India today,
working across photography, video and installation.
They frequently explore themes of globalization and urbanization,
and their home of Delhi is a frequent element in their work.
Here, they invite the viewer to analyze a crime
looking at evidence and clues embedded
in five narratives on these five different screens,
in which the city itself may have been the culprit.
This next artist is probably the alpha male
of contemporary Indian art, Subodh Gupta.
He was first known for creating giant photo-realistic canvases,
paintings of everyday objects,
the stainless steel kitchen vessels and tiffin containers
known to every Indian.
He celebrates these local and mundane objects globally,
and on a grander and grander scale,
by incorporating them into ever more colossal
sculptures and installations.
And finally number 10, last and certainly not least,
Ranjani Shettar,
who lives and works here in the state of Karnataka,
creates ethereal sculptures and installations
that really marry the organic to the industrial,
and brings, like Subodh, the local global.
These are actually wires wrapped in muslin
and steeped in vegetable dye.
And she arranges them so that the viewer
actually has to navigate through the space,
and interact with the objects.
And light and shadow are a very important part of her work.
She also explores themes of consumerism,
and the environment, such as in this work,
where these basket-like objects look organic and woven,
and are woven,
but with the strips of steel, salvaged from cars
that she found in a Bangalore junkyard.
10 artists, six minutes, I know that was a lot to take in.
But I can only hope I've whet your appetite
to go out and see and learn more
about the amazing things that are happening in art in India today.
Thank you very much for looking and listening.
(Applause)
I decided when I was asked to do this
that what I really wanted to talk about
was my friend, Richard Feynman.
I was one of the fortunate few
that really did get to know him
and enjoyed his presence.
And I'm going to tell you
about the Richard Feynman that I knew.
I'm sure there are people here
who could tell you
about the Richard Feynman they knew,
and it would probably be
a different Richard Feynman.
Richard Feynman was a very complex man.
He was a man of many, many parts.
He was, of course, foremost,
a very, very, very great scientist.
He was an actor. You saw him act.
I also had the good fortune
to be in those lectures,
up in the balcony.
They were fantastic.
He was a philosopher.
He was a drum player.
He was a teacher par excellence.
Richard Feynman was also a showman,
an enormous showman.
He was brash, irreverent.
He was full of macho,
a kind of macho one-upmanship.
He loved intellectual battle.
He had a gargantuan ego.
But the man had, somehow,
a lot of room at the bottom.
And what I mean by that
is a lot of room, in my case --
I can't speak for anybody else,
but in my case --
a lot of room for another big ego.
Well, not as big as his,
but fairly big.
I always felt good with Dick Feynman.
It was always fun to be with him.
He always made me feel smart.
How can somebody like that
make you feel smart?
Somehow he did.
He made me feel smart.
He made me feel he was smart.
He made me feel we were both smart,
and the two of us could solve
any problem whatever.
And in fact, we did sometimes
do physics together.
We never published a paper together,
but we did have a lot of fun.
He loved to win,
win these little macho games
we would sometimes play.
And he didn't only play them with me,
but with all sorts of people.
He would almost always win.
But when he didn't win, when he lost,
he would laugh and seem
to have just as much fun
as if he had won.
I remember once he told me a story
about a joke the students played on him.
I think it was for his birthday --
they took him for lunch
to a sandwich place in Pasadena.
It may still exist; I don't know.
Celebrity sandwiches was their thing.
You could get a Marilyn Monroe sandwich.
You could get a Humphrey Bogart sandwich.
The students went there in advance,
and arranged that they'd all order
Feynman sandwiches.
One after another, they came in
and ordered Feynman sandwiches.
Feynman loved this story.
He told me this story,
and he was really happy and laughing.
When he finished the story, I said to him,
"Dick, I wonder what
would be the difference
between a Feynman sandwich
and a Susskind sandwich."
And without skipping a beat at all,
he said, "Well, they'd be about the same.
The only difference is a Susskind
sandwich would have a lot more ham."
"Ham" as in bad actor.
(Laughter)
Well, I happened to have been
very quick that day,
and I said, "Yeah,
but a lot less baloney."
(Laughter)
(Applause)
The truth of the matter
is that a Feynman sandwich
had a load of ham,
but absolutely no baloney.
What Feynman hated worse
than anything else
was intellectual pretense --
phoniness,
false sophistication, jargon.
I remember sometime during the mid-'80s,
Dick and I and Sidney Coleman
would meet a couple of times
up in San Francisco --
at some very rich guy's house --
up in San Francisco for dinner.
And the last time the rich guy invited us,
he also invited a couple of philosophers.
These guys were philosophers of mind.
Their specialty was the philosophy
of consciousness.
And they were full of all kinds of jargon.
I'm trying to remember the words --
"monism," "dualism,"
categories all over the place.
I didn't know what those meant, neither
did Dick or Sydney, for that matter.
And what did we talk about?
Well, what do you talk about
when you talk about minds?
There's one obvious thing to talk about:
Can a machine become a mind?
Can you build a machine
that thinks like a human being
that is conscious?
We sat around and talked about this --
we of course never resolved it.
But the trouble with the philosophers
is that they were philosophizing
when they should have been
science-ophizing.
It's a scientific question, after all.
And this was a very, very
dangerous thing to do
around Dick Feynman.
(Laughter)
Feynman let them have it --
both barrels, right between the eyes.
It was brutal; it was funny --
ooh, it was funny.
But it was really brutal.
He really popped their balloon.
But the amazing thing was --
Feynman had to leave a little early;
he wasn't feeling too well,
so he left a little bit early.
And Sidney and I were left there
with the two philosophers.
And the amazing thing
is these guys were flying.
They were so happy.
They had met the great man;
they had been instructed by the great man;
they had an enormous amount of fun
having their faces shoved in the mud ...
And it was something special.
I realized there was something
just extraordinary about Feynman,
even when he did what he did.
Dick -- he was my friend;
I did call him Dick --
Dick and I had a little bit of a rapport.
I think it may have been a special
rapport that he and I had.
We liked each other;
we liked the same kind of things.
I also like the intellectual macho games.
Sometimes I would win,
mostly he would win,
but we both enjoyed them.
And Dick became convinced at some point
that he and I had
some kind of similarity of personality.
I don't think he was right.
I think the only point
of similarity between us
is we both like to talk about ourselves.
But he was convinced of this.
And the man was incredibly curious.
And he wanted to understand
what it was and why it was
that there was this funny connection.
And one day, we were walking.
We were in France, in Les Houches.
We were up in the mountains, 1976.
And Feynman said to me, "Leonardo ..."
The reason he called me "Leonardo"
is because we were in Europe,
and he was practicing his French.
(Laughter)
And he said, "Leonardo,
were you closer to your mother
or your father when you were a kid?"
I said, "Well, my real hero was my father.
He was a working man,
had a fifth-grade education.
He was a master mechanic,
and he taught me how to use tools.
He taught me all sorts of things
about mechanical things.
He even taught me the Pythagorean theorem.
He didn't call it the hypotenuse,
he called it the shortcut distance."
And Feynman's eyes just opened up.
He went off like a lightbulb.
And he said that he had had
basically exactly the same
relationship with his father.
In fact, he had been convinced at one time
that to be a good physicist,
it was very important to have had
that kind of relationship
with your father.
I apologize for the sexist
conversation here,
but this is the way it really happened.
He said he had been absolutely
convinced that this was necessary,
a necessary part of the growing up
of a young physicist.
Being Dick, he, of course,
wanted to check this.
He wanted to go out and do an experiment.
(Laughter)
Well, he did.
He went out and did an experiment.
He asked all his friends
that he thought were good physicists,
"Was it your mom or your pop
that influenced you?"
They were all men,
and to a man, every single
one of them said,
"My mother."
(Laughter)
There went that theory,
down the trash can of history.
(Laughter)
But he was very excited
that he had finally met somebody
who had the same experience
with his father
as he had with his father.
And for some time, he was convinced
this was the reason we got along so well.
I don't know. Maybe. Who knows?
But let me tell you a little bit
about Feynman the physicist.
Feynman's style --
no, "style" is not the right word.
"Style" makes you think
of the bow tie he might have worn,
or the suit he was wearing.
It's something much deeper than that,
but I can't think of another word for it.
Feynman's scientific style
was always to look for the simplest,
most elementary solution
to a problem that was possible.
If it wasn't possible,
you had to use something fancier.
No doubt, part of this
was his great joy and pleasure
in showing people that he could
think more simply than they could.
But he also deeply believed,
he truly believed,
that if you couldn't explain
something simply,
you didn't understand it.
In the 1950s, people
were trying to figure out
how superfluid helium worked.
There was a theory.
It was due to a Russian
mathematical physicist.
It was a complicated theory;
I'll tell you what it was soon enough.
It was a terribly complicated theory,
full of very difficult
integrals and formulas
and mathematics and so forth.
And it sort of worked,
but it didn't work very well.
The only way it worked
is when the helium atoms
were very, very far apart.
And unfortunately,
the helium atoms in liquid helium
are right on top of each other.
Feynman decided, as a sort
of amateur helium physicist,
that he would try to figure it out.
He had an idea, a very clear idea.
He would try to figure out
what the quantum wave function
of this huge number of atoms looked like.
He would try to visualize it,
guided by a small number
of simple principles.
The small number of simple principles
were very, very simple.
The first one was that when
helium atoms touch each other,
they repel.
The implication of that is that
the wave function has to go to zero,
it has to vanish when the helium
atoms touch each other.
The other fact
is that in the ground state --
the lowest energy state
of a quantum system --
the wave function is always very smooth;
it has the minimum number of wiggles.
So he sat down --
and I imagine he had nothing more
than a simple piece
of paper and a pencil --
and he tried to write down,
and did write down,
the simplest function
that he could think of,
which had the boundary conditions
that the wave function
vanish when things touch
and is smooth in between.
He wrote down a simple thing --
so simple, in fact,
that I suspect a really smart
high-school student
who didn't even have calculus
could understand what he wrote down.
The thing was, that simple thing
that he wrote down
explained everything that was known
at the time about liquid helium,
and then some.
I've always wondered
whether the professionals --
the real professional helium physicists --
were just a little bit
embarrassed by this.
They had their super-powerful technique,
and they couldn't do as well.
Incidentally, I'll tell you
what that super-powerful technique was.
It was the technique of Feynman diagrams.
(Laughter)
He did it again in 1968.
In 1968, in my own university --
I wasn't there at the time --
they were exploring
the structure of the proton.
The proton is obviously made
of a whole bunch of little particles;
this was more or less known.
And the way to analyze it was,
of course, Feynman diagrams.
That's what Feynman diagrams
were constructed for --
to understand particles.
The experiments that were going on
were very simple:
you simply take the proton,
and you hit it really sharply
with an electron.
This was the thing
the Feynman diagrams were for.
The only problem was that
Feynman diagrams are complicated.
They're difficult integrals.
If you could do all of them,
you would have a very precise theory,
but you couldn't --
they were just too complicated.
People were trying to do them.
You could do a one-loop diagram.
Don't worry about one loop.
One loop, two loops --
maybe you could do a three-loop diagram,
but beyond that, you couldn't do anything.
Feynman said, "Forget all of that.
Just think of the proton
as an assemblage, a swarm,
of little particles."
He called them "partons."
He said, "Just think of it as a swarm
of partons moving real fast."
Because they're moving real fast,
relativity says the internal
motions go very slow.
The electron hits it suddenly --
it's like taking a very sudden
snapshot of the proton.
What do you see?
You see a frozen bunch of partons.
They don't move,
and because they don't move
during the course of the experiment,
you don't have to worry
about how they're moving.
You don't have to worry
about the forces between them.
You just get to think of it
as a population of frozen partons."
This was the key to analyzing
these experiments.
Extremely effective.
Somebody said the word
"revolution" is a bad word.
I suppose it is,
so I won't say "revolution,"
but it certainly evolved very, very deeply
our understanding of the proton,
and of particles beyond that.
Well, I had some more
that I was going to tell you
about my connection with Feynman,
what he was like,
but I see I have exactly half a minute.
So I think I'll just finish up by saying:
I actually don't think
Feynman would have liked this event.
I think he would have said,
"I don't need this."
But ...
(Laughter)
How should we honor Feynman?
How should we really honor Feynman?
I think the answer
is we should honor Feynman
by getting as much baloney
out of our own sandwiches
as we can.
Thank you.
(Applause)
I want to tell you guys
something about neuroscience.
I'm a physicist by training.
About three years ago, I left physics
to come and try to understand
how the brain works.
And this is what I found.
Lots of people are working on depression.
And that's really good,
depression is something
that we really want to understand.
Here's how you do it:
you take a jar and you fill it up,
about halfway, with water.
And then you take a mouse,
and you put the mouse in the jar, OK?
And the mouse swims around
for a little while
and then at some point,
the mouse gets tired
and decides to stop swimming.
And when it stops swimming,
that's depression.
OK?
And I'm from theoretical physics,
so I'm used to people making
very sophisticated mathematical models
to precisely describe physical phenomena,
so when I saw that this
is the model for depression,
I though to myself, "Oh my God,
we have a lot of work to do."
(Laughter)
But this is a kind of general
problem in neuroscience.
So for example, take emotion.
Lots of people want to understand emotion.
But you can't study emotion
in mice or monkeys
because you can't ask them
how they're feeling
or what they're experiencing.
So instead, people who want
to understand emotion,
typically end up studying
what's called motivated behavior,
which is code for "what the mouse does
when it really, really wants cheese."
OK, I could go on and on.
I mean, the point is, the NIH
spends about 5.5 billion dollars a year
on neuroscience research.
And yet there have been almost
no significant improvements in outcomes
for patients with brain diseases
in the past 40 years.
And I think a lot of that
is basically due to the fact
that mice might be OK as a model
for cancer or diabetes,
but the mouse brain
is just not sophisticated enough
to reproduce human psychology
or human brain disease.
OK?
So if the mouse models are so bad,
why are we still using them?
Well, it basically boils down to this:
the brain is made up of neurons
which are these little cells that send
electrical signals to each other.
If you want to understand
how the brain works,
you have to be able to measure
the electrical activity of these neurons.
But to do that, you have to get
really close to the neurons
with some kind of electrical
recording device or a microscope.
And so you can do that in mice
and you can do it in monkeys,
because you can physically
put things into their brain
but for some reason we still
can't do that in humans, OK?
So instead, we've invented
all these proxies.
So the most popular one is probably this,
functional MRI, fMRI,
which allows you to make these
pretty pictures like this,
that show which parts
of your brain light up
when you're engaged
in different activities.
But this is a proxy.
You're not actually measuring
neural activity here.
What you're doing
is you're measuring, essentially,
like, blood flow in the brain.
Where there's more blood.
It's actually where there's more oxygen,
but you get the idea, OK?
The other thing that you can do
is you can do this --
electroencephalography -- you can put
these electrodes on your head, OK?
And then you can measure your brain waves.
And here, you're actually measuring
electrical activity.
But you're not measuring
the activity of neurons.
You're measuring
these electrical currents,
sloshing back and forth in your brain.
So the point is just
that these technologies that we have
are really measuring the wrong thing.
Because, for most of the diseases
that we want to understand --
like, Parkinson's is the classic example.
In Parkinson's, there's one particular
kind of neuron deep in your brain
that is responsible for the disease,
and these technologies just don't have
the resolution that you need
to get at that.
And so that's why
we're still stuck with the animals.
Not that anyone wants
to be studying depression
by putting mice into jars, right?
It's just that there's this pervasive
sense that it's not possible
to look at the activity of neurons
in healthy humans.
So here's what I want to do.
I want to take you into the future.
To have a look at one way in which
I think it could potentially be possible.
And I want to preface this by saying,
I don't have all the details.
So I'm just going to provide you
with a kind of outline.
But we're going to go the year 2100.
Now what does the year 2100 look like?
Well, to start with, the climate
is a bit warmer that what you're used to.
(Laughter)
And that robotic vacuum cleaner
that you know and love
went through a few generations,
and the improvements
were not always so good.
(Laughter)
It was not always for the better.
But actually, in the year 2100
most things are surprisingly recognizable.
It's just the brain is totally different.
For example, in the year 2100,
we understand the root causes
of Alzheimer's.
So we can deliver targeted
genetic therapies or drugs
to stop the degenerative process
before it begins.
So how did we do it?
Well, there were essentially three steps.
The first step was
that we had to figure out
some way to get electrical
connections through the skull
so we could measure
the electrical activity of neurons.
And not only that,
it had to be easy and risk-free.
Something that basically anyone
would be OK with,
like getting a piercing.
Because back in 2017,
the only way that we knew of
to get through the skull
was to drill these holes
the size of quarters.
You would never let
someone do that to you.
So in the 2020s,
people began to experiment --
rather than drilling these gigantic holes,
drilling microscopic holes,
no thicker than a piece of hair.
And the idea here
was really for diagnosis --
there are lots of times in the diagnosis
of brain disorders
when you would like to be able to look
at the neural activity beneath the skull
and being able to drill
these microscopic holes
would make that much easier
for the patient.
In the end, it would be
like getting a shot.
You just go in and you sit down
and there's a thing
that comes down on your head,
and a momentary sting and then it's done,
and you can go back about your day.
So we're eventually able to do it
using lasers to drill the holes.
And with the lasers,
it was fast and extremely reliable,
you couldn't even tell
the holes were there,
any more than you could tell
that one of your hairs was missing.
And I know it might sound crazy,
using lasers to drill holes in your skull,
but back in 2017,
people were OK with surgeons
shooting lasers into their eyes
for corrective surgery
So when you're already here,
it's not that big of a step.
OK?
So the next step,
that happened in the 2030s,
was that it's not just about
getting through the skull.
To measure the activity of neurons,
you have to actually make it
into the brain tissue itself.
And the risk, whenever
you put something into the brain tissue,
is essentially that of stroke.
That you would hit
a blood vessel and burst it,
and that causes a stroke.
So, by the mid 2030s,
we had invented these flexible probes
that were capable of going
around blood vessels,
rather than through them.
And thus, we could put
huge batteries of these probes
into the brains of patients
and record from thousands of their neurons
without any risk to them.
And what we discovered,
sort of to our surprise,
is that the neurons that we could identify
were not responding
to things like ideas or emotion,
which was what we had expected.
They were mostly responding
to things like Jennifer Aniston
or Halle Berry
or Justin Trudeau.
I mean --
(Laughter)
In hindsight, we shouldn't
have been that surprised.
I mean, what do your neurons
spend most of their time thinking about?
(Laughter)
But really, the point is that
this technology enabled us to begin
studying neuroscience in individuals.
So much like the transition to genetics,
at the single cell level,
we started to study neuroscience,
at the single human level.
But we weren't quite there yet.
Because these technologies
were still restricted
to medical applications,
which meant that we were studying
sick brains, not healthy brains.
Because no matter how safe
your technology is,
you can't stick something
into someone's brain
for research purposes.
They have to want it.
And why would they want it?
Because as soon as you have
an electrical connection to the brain,
you can use it to hook
the brain up to a computer.
Oh, well, you know, the general public
was very skeptical at first.
I mean, who wants to hook
their brain up to their computers?
Well just imagine being able
to send an email with a thought.
(Laughter)
Imagine being able to take
a picture with your eyes, OK?
(Laughter)
Imagine never forgetting anything anymore,
because anything
that you choose to remember
will be stored permanently
on a hard drive somewhere,
able to be recalled at will.
(Laughter)
The line here
between crazy and visionary
was never quite clear.
But the systems were safe.
So when the FDA decided to deregulate
these laser-drilling systems, in 2043,
commercial demand just exploded.
People started signing their emails,
"Please excuse any typos.
Sent from my brain."
(Laughter)
Commercial systems
popped up left and right,
offering the latest and greatest
in neural interfacing technology.
There were 100 electrodes.
A thousand electrodes.
High bandwidth for only 99.99 a month.
(Laughter)
Soon, everyone had them.
And that was the key.
Because, in the 2050s,
if you were a neuroscientist,
you could have someone come into your lab
essentially from off the street.
And you could have them engaged
in some emotional task
or social behavior or abstract reasoning,
things you could never study in mice.
And you could record
the activity of their neurons
using the interfaces
that they already had.
And then you could also ask them
about what they were experiencing.
So this link between
psychology and neuroscience
that you could never make
in the animals, was suddenly there.
So perhaps the classic example of this
was the discovery
of the neural basis for insight.
That "Aha!" moment, the moment
it all comes together, it clicks.
And this was discovered
by two scientists in 2055,
Barry and Late,
who observed, in the dorsal
prefrontal cortex,
how in the brain of someone
trying to understand an idea,
how different populations of neurons
would reorganize themselves --
you're looking at neural
activity here in orange --
until finally their activity aligns
in a way that leads to positive feedback.
Right there.
That is understanding.
So finally, we were able to get
at the things that make us human.
And that's what really opened the way
to major insights from medicine.
Because, starting in the 2060s,
with the ability to record
the neural activity
in the brains of patients
with these different mental diseases,
rather than defining the diseases
on the basis of their symptoms,
as we had at the beginning of the century,
we started to define them
on the basis of the actual pathology
that we observed at the neural level.
So for example, in the case of ADHD,
we discovered that there are
dozens of different diseases,
all of which had been called ADHD
at the start of the century,
that actually had nothing
to do with each other,
except that they had similar symptoms.
And they needed to be treated
in different ways.
So it was kind of incredible,
in retrospect,
that at the beginning of the century,
we had been treating
all those different diseases
with the same drug,
just by giving people amphetamine,
basically is what we were doing.
And schizophrenia and depression
are the same way.
So rather than prescribing drugs to people
essentially at random,
as we had,
we learned how to predict
which drugs would be most effective
in which patients,
and that just led to this huge
improvement in outcomes.
OK, I want to bring you back now
to the year 2017.
Some of this may sound satirical
or even far fetched.
And some of it is.
I mean, I can't actually
see into the future.
I don't actually know
if we're going to be drilling hundreds
or thousands of microscopic holes
in our heads in 30 years.
But what I can tell you
is that we're not going
to make any progress
towards understanding the human brain
or human diseases
until we figure out how to get
at the electrical activity of neurons
in healthy humans.
And almost no one is working
on figuring out how to do that today.
That is the future of neuroscience.
And I think it's time for neuroscientists
to put down the mouse brain
and to dedicate the thought
and investment necessary
to understand the human brain
and human disease.
Thank you.
(Applause)
I'm going to start
on a slightly somber note.
Two thousand and seven, five years ago,
my wife gets diagnosed with breast cancer.
Stage IIB.
Now, looking back, the most
harrowing part of that experience
was not just the hospital visits --
these were very painful
for my wife, understandably so.
It was not even the initial shock
of knowing that she had breast cancer
at just 39 years old,
absolutely no history
of cancer in her family.
The most horrifying and agonizing part
of the whole experience
was we were making decisions
after decisions after decisions
that were being thrust upon us.
Should it be a mastectomy?
Should it be a lumpectomy?
Should it be a more
aggressive form of treatment,
given that it was stage IIB?
With all the side effects?
Or should it be a less
aggressive form of treatment?
And these were being thrust
upon us by the doctors.
Now you could ask this question,
why were the doctors doing this?
A simplistic answer would be,
the doctors are doing this
because they want to protect
themselves legally.
I think that is too simplistic.
These are well-meaning doctors,
some of them have gone on
to become very good friends.
They probably were simply
following the wisdom
that has come down through the ages,
this adage that when
you're making decisions,
especially decisions of importance,
it's best to be in charge,
it's best to be in control,
it's best to be in the driver's seat.
And we were certainly
in the driver's seat,
making all these decisions.
And let me tell you --
if some of you have been there,
it was a most agonizing
and harrowing experience.
Which got me thinking.
I said, is there any validity
to this whole adage
that when you're making decisions,
it's best to take the driver's seat,
be in charge, be in control?
Or are there contexts
where we're far better off
taking the passenger's seat
and have someone else drive?
For example, a trusted financial advisor,
could be a trusted doctor, etc.
And since I study human decision making,
I said, I'm going to run some studies
to find some answers.
And I'm going to share one
of these studies with you today.
So, imagine that all of you
are participants in the study.
I want to tell you that
what you're going to do in the study is,
you're going to drink a cup of tea.
If you're wondering why, I'll tell you why
in a few seconds from now.
You are going to solve
a series of puzzles,
and I'm going to show you examples
of these puzzles momentarily.
And the more puzzles you solve,
the greater the chances
that you'll win some prizes.
Now, why do you have to consume the tea?
Why? Because it makes a lot of sense:
In order to solve these puzzles
effectively, if you think about it,
your mind needs to be in two states
simultaneously, right?
It needs to be alert,
for which caffeine is very good.
Simultaneously, it needs to be calm --
not agitated, calm --
for which chamomile is very good.
Now comes the between-subjects design,
the AB design, the AB testing.
So what I'm going to do is randomly
assign you to one of two groups.
So imagine that there is
an imaginary line out here,
so everyone here will be group A,
everyone out here will be group B.
Now, for you folks, what I'm going to do
is I'm going to show you these two teas,
and I'll go ahead and ask you
to choose your tea.
So you can choose whichever tea you want.
You can decide, what is your mental state:
OK, I choose the caffeinated tea,
I choose the chamomile tea.
So you're going to be in charge,
you're going to be in control,
you're going to be in the driver's seat.
You folks, I'm going to show you
these two teas,
but you don't have a choice.
I'm going to give you
one of these two teas,
and keep in mind, I'm going
to pick one of these two teas
at random for you.
And you know that.
So if you think about it,
this is an extreme-case scenario,
because in the real world,
whenever you are taking passenger's seat,
very often the driver is going
to be someone you trust,
an expert, etc.
So this is an extreme-case scenario.
Now, you're all going to consume the tea.
So imagine that you're taking the tea now,
we'll wait for you to finish the tea.
We'll give another five minutes
for the ingredient to have its effects.
Now you're going to have
30 minutes to solve 15 puzzles.
Here's an example of the puzzle
you're going to solve.
Anyone in the audience
want to take a stab?
Audience member: Pulpit!
Baba Shiv: Whoa! OK.
That's cool.
Yeah, so what we'd do if we had
you who gave the answer
as a participant,
we would have calibrated
the difficulty level
of the puzzles to your expertise.
Because we want
these puzzles to be difficult.
These are tricky puzzles,
because your first instinct
is to say "tulip."
And then you have to unstick yourself.
Right?
So these have been calibrated
to your level of expertise,
because we want this to be difficult,
and I'll tell you why, momentarily.
Now, here's another example.
Anyone? This is much more difficult.
Audience member: Embark.
BS: Yeah. Wow! OK.
So, yeah, so this is, again, difficult.
You'll say "kamber," then you'll go,
"maker," and all that,
and then you can unstick yourself.
So you have 30 minutes now
to solve these 15 puzzles.
Now, the question we're asking
here is, in terms of the outcome --
and it comes in the number
of puzzles solved --
will you in the driver's seat
end up solving more puzzles
because you are in control,
you could decide which tea
you would choose,
or would you be better off,
in terms of the number of puzzles solved?
And, systemically, what we will show,
across a series of studies,
is that you, the passengers,
even though the tea
was picked for you at random,
will end up solving
more puzzles than you, the drivers.
We also observe another thing,
and that is, you folks not only
are solving fewer puzzles,
you're also putting less juice
into the task -- less effort,
you're less persistent, and so on.
How do we know that?
Well, we have two objective measures.
One is, what is the time,
on average, you're taking
in attempting to solve these puzzles?
You will spend less time compared to you.
Second, you have
30 minutes to solve these;
are you taking the entire 30 minutes
or are you giving up
before the 30 minutes elapse?
You will be more likely to give up
before the 30 minutes elapse,
compared to you.
So you're putting in less juice,
and therefore, the outcome:
fewer puzzles solved.
That brings us now to:
why does this happen?
And under what situations -- when --
would we see this pattern of results
where the passenger is going to show
better, more favorable outcomes,
compared to the driver?
It all has to do with when you face
what I call the INCA.
It's an acronym that stands for the nature
of the feedback you're getting
after you made the decision.
So if you think about it,
in this particular puzzle task --
it could happen in investing
in the stock market,
very volatile out there,
it could be the medical situation --
the feedback here is immediate.
You know the feedback,
whether you're solving the puzzles or not.
Right? Second, it is negative.
Remember, the deck
was stacked against you,
in terms of the difficulty
level of these puzzles.
And this can happen in the medical domain.
For example, very early on
in the treatment,
things are negative, the feedback,
before things become positive.
Right? It can happen in the stock market.
Volatile stock market, getting negative
feedback, it is also immediate.
And the feedback in all these cases
is concrete, it's unambiguous;
you know if you've solved
the puzzles or not.
Now, the added one,
apart from this immediacy,
negative, this concreteness --
now you have a sense of agency.
You were responsible for your decision.
So what do you do?
You focus on the foregone option.
You say, you know what?
I should have chosen the other tea.
(Laughter)
That casts your decision in doubt,
reduces the confidence
you have in the decision,
the confidence you have
in the performance,
the performance in terms
of solving the puzzles.
And therefore less juice into the task,
fewer puzzles solved
and less favorable outcomes
compared to you folks.
And this can happen in the medical
domain, if you think about it, right?
A patient in the driver's
seat, for example.
Less juice, which means
keeping herself or himself
less physically fit, physically active
to hasten the recovery process,
which is what is often advocated.
You probably wouldn't do that.
And therefore, there are times
when you're facing the INCA,
when the feedback is going
to be immediate, negative, concrete
and you have the sense of agency,
where you're far better off
taking the passenger's seat
and have someone else drive.
Now, I started off on a somber note.
I want to finish up on a more upbeat note.
It has now been five years,
slightly more than five years,
and the good news, thank God,
is that the cancer is still in remission.
So it all ends well.
But one thing I didn't mention
was that very early on into her treatment,
my wife and I decided
that we would take the passenger's seat.
And that made so much of a difference
in terms of the peace of mind
that came with that;
we could focus on her recovery.
We let the doctors make all the decisions
and take the driver's seat.
Thank you.
(Applause)
I'm a neuroscientist, and I study decision-making.
I do experiments to test how different chemicals
in the brain influence the choices we make.
I'm here to tell you the secret to successful decision-making:
a cheese sandwich.
That's right. According to scientists, a cheese sandwich
is the solution to all your tough decisions.
How do I know? I'm the scientist who did the study.
A few years ago, my colleagues and I were interested
in how a brain chemical called serotonin
would influence people's decisions in social situations.
Specifically, we wanted to know how serotonin would affect
the way people react when they're treated unfairly.
So we did an experiment.
We manipulated people's serotonin levels by giving them
this really disgusting-tasting artificial lemon-flavored drink
that works by taking away the raw ingredient for serotonin
in the brain.
This is the amino acid tryptophan.
So what we found was, when tryptophan was low,
people were more likely to take revenge
when they're treated unfairly.
That's the study we did, and here are some of the headlines
that came out afterwards.
("A cheese sandwich is all you need for strong decision-making")
("What a friend we have in cheeses")
("Eating Cheese and Meat May Boost Self-Control") At this point, you might be wondering, did I miss something?
("Official! Chocolate stops you being grumpy") Cheese? Chocolate? Where did that come from?
And I thought the same thing myself when these came out,
because our study had nothing to do with cheese or chocolate.
We gave people this horrible-tasting drink
that affected their tryptophan levels.
But it turns out that tryptophan also happens to be found
in cheese and chocolate.
And of course when science says cheese and chocolate
help you make better decisions, well, that's sure to grab people's attention.
So there you have it:
the evolution of a headline.
When this happened, a part of me thought, well,
what's the big deal?
So the media oversimplified a few things, but in the end,
it's just a news story.
And I think a lot of scientists have this attitude.
But the problem is that this kind of thing happens all the time,
and it affects not just the stories you read in the news
but also the products you see on the shelves.
When the headlines rolled, what happened was,
the marketers came calling.
Would I be willing to provide a scientific endorsement
of a mood-boosting bottled water?
Or would I go on television to demonstrate,
in front of a live audience,
that comfort foods really do make you feel better?
I think these folks meant well, but had I taken them up on their offers,
I would have been going beyond the science,
and good scientists are careful not to do this.
But nevertheless, neuroscience is turning up more and more in marketing.
Here's one example: Neuro drinks,
a line of products, including Nuero Bliss here,
which according to its label helps reduce stress,
enhances mood, provides focused concentration,
and promotes a positive outlook.
I have to say, this sounds awesome. (Laughter)
I could totally have used this 10 minutes ago.
So when this came up in my local shop, naturally I was
curious about some of the research backing these claims.
So I went to the company's website looking to find
some controlled trials of their products.
But I didn't find any.
Trial or no trial, these claims are front and center
on their label right next to a picture of a brain.
And it turns out that pictures of brains have special properties.
A couple of researchers asked a few hundred people
to read a scientific article.
For half the people, the article included a brain image,
and for the other half, it was the same article
but it didn't have a brain image.
At the end — you see where this is going —
people were asked whether they agreed
with the conclusions of the article.
So this is how much people agree with the conclusions
with no image.
And this is how much they agree with the same article
that did include a brain image.
So the take-home message here is,
do you want to sell it? Put a brain on it.
Now let me pause here and take a moment to say that
neuroscience has advanced a lot in the last few decades,
and we're constantly discovering amazing things
about the brain.
Like, just a couple of weeks ago, neuroscientists at MIT
figured out how to break habits in rats
just by controlling neural activity in a specific part of their brain.
Really cool stuff.
But the promise of neuroscience has led to some really
high expectations and some overblown, unproven claims.
So what I'm going to do is show you how to spot
a couple of classic moves, dead giveaways, really,
for what's variously been called neuro-bunk,
neuro-bollocks, or, my personal favorite, neuro-flapdoodle.
So the first unproven claim is that you can use brain scans
to read people's thoughts and emotions.
Here's a study published by a team of researchers
as an op-ed in The New York Times.
The headline? "You Love Your iPhone. Literally."
It quickly became the most emailed article on the site.
So how'd they figure this out?
They put 16 people inside a brain scanner
and showed them videos of ringing iPhones.
The brain scans showed activation in a part of the brain
called the insula, a region they say
is linked to feelings of love and compassion.
So they concluded that because they saw activation in the insula,
this meant the subjects loved their iPhones.
Now there's just one problem with this line of reasoning,
and that's that the insula does a lot.
Sure, it is involved in positive emotions
like love and compassion,
but it's also involved in tons of other processes,
like memory, language, attention,
even anger, disgust and pain.
So based on the same logic, I could equally conclude
you hate your iPhone.
The point here is, when you see activation in the insula,
you can't just pick and choose your favorite explanation
from off this list, and it's a really long list.
My colleagues Tal Yarkoni and Russ Poldrack
have shown that the insula pops up in almost a third
of all brain imaging studies that have ever been published.
So chances are really, really good
that your insula is going off right now,
but I won't kid myself
to think this means you love me.
So speaking of love and the brain,
there's a researcher, known to some as Dr. Love,
who claims that scientists have found the glue
that holds society together,
the source of love and prosperity.
This time it's not a cheese sandwich.
No, it's a hormone called oxytocin.
You've probably heard of it.
So, Dr. Love bases his argument on studies showing
that when you boost people's oxytocin,
this increases their trust, empathy and cooperation.
So he's calling oxytocin "the moral molecule."
Now these studies are scientifically valid,
and they've been replicated, but they're not the whole story.
Other studies have shown that boosting oxytocin
increases envy. It increases gloating.
Oxytocin can bias people to favor their own group
at the expense of other groups.
And in some cases, oxytocin can even decrease cooperation.
So based on these studies, I could say oxytocin
is an immoral molecule, and call myself Dr. Strangelove.
(Laughter)
So we've seen neuro-flapdoodle all over the headlines.
We see it in supermarkets, on book covers.
What about the clinic?
SPECT imaging is a brain-scanning technology
that uses a radioactive tracer
to track blood flow in the brain.
For the bargain price of a few thousand dollars,
there are clinics in the U.S. that will give you
one of these SPECT scans and use the image
to help diagnose your problems.
These scans, the clinics say, can help
prevent Alzheimer's disease,
solve weight and addiction issues,
overcome marital conflicts,
and treat, of course, a variety of mental illnesses
ranging from depression to anxiety to ADHD.
This sounds great. A lot of people agree.
Some of these clinics are pulling in tens of millions
of dollars a year in business.
There's just one problem.
The broad consensus in neuroscience
is that we can't yet diagnose mental illness
from a single brain scan.
But these clinics have treated
tens of thousands of patients to date,
many of them children,
and SPECT imaging involves a radioactive injection,
so exposing people to radiation, potentially harmful.
I am more excited than most people, as a neuroscientist,
about the potential for neuroscience to treat mental illness
and even maybe to make us better and smarter.
And if one day we can say that cheese and chocolate
help us make better decisions, count me in.
But we're not there yet.
We haven't found a "buy" button inside the brain,
we can't tell whether someone is lying or in love
just by looking at their brain scans,
and we can't turn sinners into saints with hormones.
Maybe someday we will, but until then,
we have to be careful that we don't let overblown claims
detract resources and attention away from the real science
that's playing a much longer game.
So here's where you come in.
If someone tries to sell you something with a brain on it,
don't just take them at their word.
Ask the tough questions. Ask to see the evidence.
Ask for the part of the story that's not being told.
The answers shouldn't be simple, because the brain isn't simple.
But that's not stopping us from trying to figure it out anyway.
Thank you. (Applause)
I'd like for you to take a moment
to imagine this with me.
You're a little girl of five years old.
Sitting in front of a mirror,
you ask yourself,
"Do I exist?"
In this space, there is
very little context,
and so you move into a different one,
one filled with people.
Surely, now you know you're not
a figment of your own imagination.
You breathe their air.
You see them,
so they must see you.
And yet, you still can't help but wonder:
Do I only exist when people speak to me?
Pretty heavy thoughts for a child, right?
But through various artworks
that reflect upon our society,
I came to understand
how a young black girl can grow up
feeling as if she's not seen,
and perhaps she doesn't exist.
You see, if young people don't have
positive images of themselves
and all that remains
are negative stereotypes,
this affects their self-image.
But it also affects the way
that the rest of society treats them.
I discovered this
having lived in Cape Town
for about five years at the time.
I felt a deep sense
of dislocation and invisibility.
I couldn't see myself represented.
I couldn't see the women who've raised me,
the ones who've influenced me,
and the ones that have made
South Africa what it is today.
I decided to do something about it.
What do you think when you see this?
If you were a black girl,
how would it make you feel?
Walking down the street,
what does the city you live in say to you?
What symbols are present?
Which histories are celebrated?
And on the other hand,
which ones are omitted?
You see, public spaces are hardly
ever as neutral as they may seem.
I discovered this when I made
this performance in 2013 on Heritage Day.
Cape Town is teeming
with masculine architecture,
monuments and statues,
such as Louis Botha in that photograph.
This overt presence of white colonial
and Afrikaner nationalist men
not only echoes a social,
gender and racial divide,
but it also continues to affect
the way that women --
and the way, particularly, black women --
see themselves in relation
to dominant male figures
in public spaces.
For this reason, among others,
I don't believe that we need statues.
The preservation of history
and the act of remembering
can be achieved in more memorable
and effective ways.
As part of a year-long
public holiday series,
I use performance art
as a form of social commentary
to draw people's attention
to certain issues,
as well as addressing the absence
of the black female body
in memorialized public spaces,
especially on public holidays.
Women's Day was coming up.
I looked at what the day means --
the Women's March
to the union buildings in 1956,
petitioning against the pass laws.
Juxtaposed with the hypocrisy
of how women are treated,
especially in public spaces today,
I decided to do something about it.
Headline:
[Women in miniskirt attacked at taxi rank]
How do I comment on such polar opposites?
In the guise of my great-grandmother,
I performed bare-breasted,
close to the taxi rank in KwaLanga.
This space is also called Freedom Square,
where women were a part of demonstrations
against apartheid laws.
I was not comfortable with women
being seen as only victims in society.
You might wonder
how people reacted to this.
(Video) Woman: (Cheering)
Woman 2 (offscreen): Yes!
Sethembile Msezane: Pretty cool, huh?
(Applause)
So I realized that through
my performances,
I've been able to make regular people
reflect upon their society,
looking at the past
as well as the current democracy.
(Video) Man (offscreen):
She's been there since three o'clock.
Man 2 (offscreen): Just before three.
About an hour still?
Man 1: Yeah. It's just a really hot day.
Man 1: It's very interesting.
It's very powerful.
I think it's cool.
I think a lot of people
are quick to join a group
that's a movement towards something,
but not many people are ready
to do something as an individual.
Man 2: So it's the individual
versus the collective.
Man 1: Yeah.
So I think her pushing her own
individual message in performance ...
it's powerful.
Yeah, I think it's quite powerful
that she's doing it on her own.
I'd be interested to know why
she's using hair extensions as wings,
or whatever those things are meant to be.
They are wings, yes?
Woman 3: With her standing
there right now,
I think it's just my interpretation
that we are bringing the statue down
and bringing up something
that's supposed to represent
African pride, I think.
Or something like that.
Something should stand while Rhodes falls,
I think that's what it's saying. Yeah.
Yes. Thank you.
Man 3: What is behind me
represents the African culture.
We can't have the colonialist law,
so we need to remove
all these colonial statues.
We have have our own statues now,
our African leaders --
Bhambatha, Moshoeshoe, Kwame Nkrumah --
all those who paid their lives
for our liberation.
We can't continue in the 21st century,
and after 21 years of democracy,
have the colonizers in our own country.
They belong somewhere.
Maybe in a museum; not here.
I mean learning institutions,
places where young people,
young minds are being shaped.
So we cannot continue to have Louis Botha,
Rhodes, all these people,
because they're representing
the colonialism.
(Applause)
Sethembile Msezane: On April 9, 2015,
the Cecil John Rhodes statue
was scheduled to be removed
after a month of debates
for and against its removal
by various stakeholders.
This caused a widespread interest
in statues in South Africa.
Opinions varied, but the media
focused on problematizing
the removal of statues.
On that -- well, that year,
I had just begun my master's
at the University of Cape Town.
During the time
of the debate of the statue,
I had been having reoccurring dreams
about a bird.
And so I started conjuring her
mentally, spiritually and through dress.
On that day,
I happened to be having
a meeting with my supervisors,
and they told me that the statue
was going to fall on that day.
I told them that I'd explain later,
but we had to postpone the meeting
because I was going to perform her
as the statue came down.
Her name was Chapungu.
She was a soapstone bird
that was looted from Great Zimbabwe
in the late 1800s,
and is still currently housed
in Cecil John Rhodes's estate
in Cape Town.
On that day,
I embodied her existence using my body,
while standing in the blazing sun
for nearly four hours.
As the time came,
the crane came alive.
The people did, too --
shouting,
screaming,
clenching their fists
and taking pictures of the moment
on their phones and cameras.
Chapungu's wings,
along with the crane,
rose to declare the fall
of Cecil John Rhodes.
(Applause)
Euphoria filled the air
as he became absent from his base,
while she remained still,
very present,
half an hour after his removal.
Twenty-three years after apartheid,
a new generation of radicals
has arisen in South Africa.
The story of Chapungu and Rhodes
in the same space and time
asks important questions
related to gender,
power,
self-representation,
history making
and repatriation.
From then on,
I realized that my spiritual
beliefs and dreams
texture my material reality.
But for me, Chapungu's story
felt incomplete.
This soapstone bird,
a spiritual medium and messenger
of God and the ancestors,
needed me to continue her story.
And so I dabbled in the dream space
a little bit more,
and this is how "Falling" was born.
[A film by Sethembile Msezane]
(Video) (A capella singing)
[FALLING]
(Applause)
In the film,
Zimbabwe, South Africa and Germany
share a common story
about the soapstone birds
that were looted from Great Zimbabwe.
After Zimbabwe gained its independence,
all the birds except for one
were returned to the monument.
"Falling" explores the mythological belief
that there will be unrest
until the final bird is returned.
Through my work,
I have realized a lot
about the world around me:
how we move through spaces,
who we choose to celebrate
and who we remember.
Now I look in the mirror
and not only see an image of myself,
but of the women
who have made me who I am today.
I stand tall in my work,
celebrating women's histories,
in the hope that perhaps one day,
no little black girl has to ever feel
like she doesn't exist.
Thank you.
(Applause)
My big idea is a very, very small idea
that can unlock billions of big ideas
that are at the moment dormant inside us.
And my little idea
that will do that is sleep.
(Laughter)
(Applause)
This is a room of type A women.
This is a room of sleep-deprived women.
And I learned the hard way
the value of sleep.
Two-and-a-half years ago,
I fainted from exhaustion.
I hit my head on my desk.
I broke my cheekbone,
I got five stitches on my right eye.
And I began the journey
of rediscovering the value of sleep.
And in the course of that, I studied,
I met with medical doctors, scientists,
and I'm here to tell you
that the way to a more productive,
more inspired, more joyful life
is getting enough sleep.
(Applause)
And we women are going to lead the way
in this new revolution,
this new feminist issue.
We are literally going to sleep
our way to the top -- literally --
(Laughter)
(Applause)
because unfortunately, for men,
sleep deprivation has become
a virility symbol.
I was recently having dinner with a guy
who bragged that he had only gotten
four hours sleep the night before.
And I felt like saying to him --
but I didn't say --
I felt like saying, "You know what?
if you had gotten five,
this dinner would have been
a lot more interesting."
(Laughter)
There is now a kind
of sleep deprivation one-upmanship.
Especially here in Washington,
if you try to make a breakfast date,
and you say, "How about eight o'clock?"
they're likely to tell you,
"Eight o'clock is too late for me,
but that's OK, I can get
a game of tennis in
and do a few conference calls
and meet you at eight."
And they think that means they are
so incredibly busy and productive,
but the truth is, they're not,
because we, at the moment,
have had brilliant leaders
in business, in finance, in politics,
making terrible decisions.
So a high IQ does not mean
that you're a good leader,
because the essence of leadership
is being able to see the iceberg
before it hits the Titanic.
(Laughter)
And we've had far too many icebergs
hitting our Titanics.
In fact, I have a feeling
that if Lehman Brothers
was Lehman Brothers and Sisters,
they might still be around.
(Laughter)
(Applause)
While all the brothers were busy
just being hyper-connected 24/7,
maybe a sister would have
noticed the iceberg,
because she would have woken up
from a seven-and-a-half-
or eight-hour sleep,
and have been able to see the big picture.
So as we are facing
all the multiple crises
in our world at the moment,
what is good for us on a personal level,
what's going to bring more joy,
gratitude, effectiveness in our lives
and be the best for our own careers,
is also what is best for the world.
So I urge you to shut your eyes,
and discover the great ideas
that lie inside us;
to shut your engines
and discover the power of sleep.
Thank you.
(Applause)
You know, what I do is write for children,
and I'm probably America's
most widely read children's author, in fact.
And I always tell people
that I don't want to show up looking like a scientist.
You can have me as a farmer, or in leathers,
and no one has ever chose farmer.
I'm here today to talk to you
about circles and epiphanies.
And you know, an epiphany
is usually something you find that you dropped someplace.
You've just got to go around the block
to see it as an epiphany.
That's a painting of a circle.
A friend of mine did that -- Richard Bollingbroke.
It's the kind of complicated circle
that I'm going to tell you about.
My circle began back in the '60s
in high school in Stow, Ohio
where I was the class queer.
I was the guy beaten up bloody
every week in the boys' room,
until one teacher saved my life.
She saved my life by letting me go to the bathroom
in the teachers' lounge.
She did it in secret.
She did it for three years.
And I had to get out of town.
I had a thumb, I had 85 dollars,
and I ended up in San Francisco, California --
met a lover --
and back in the '80s, found it necessary
to begin work on AIDS organizations.
About three or four years ago,
I got a phone call in the middle of the night
from that teacher, Mrs. Posten,
who said, "I need to see you.
I'm disappointed
that we never got to know each other as adults.
Could you please come to Ohio,
and please bring that man
that I know you have found by now.
And I should mention
that I have pancreatic cancer,
and I'd like you to please
be quick about this."
Well, the next day we were in Cleveland.
We took a look at her, we laughed, we cried,
and we knew that she needed to be in a hospice.
We found her one, we got her there,
and we took care of her
and watched over her family,
because it was necessary.
It's something we knew how to do.
And just as the woman who wanted to know me as an adult
got to know me,
she turned into a box of ashes
and was placed in my hands.
And what had happened
was the circle had closed,
it had become a circle --
and that epiphany I talked about
presented itself.
The epiphany is
that death is a part of life.
She saved my life;
I and my partner saved hers.
And you know, that part of life needs everything
that the rest of life does.
It needs truth and beauty,
and I'm so happy it's been mentioned so much here today.
It also needs --
it needs dignity,
love and pleasure,
and it's our job to hand those things out.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Paul Krugman, the Nobel Prize
[winner] in economics, once wrote:
"Productivity is not everything,
but in the long run,
it is almost everything."
So this is serious.
There are not that many things on earth
that are "almost everything."
Productivity is the principal driver
of the prosperity of a society.
So we have a problem.
In the largest European economies,
productivity used to grow
five percent per annum
in the '50s, '60s, early '70s.
From '73 to '83: three percent per annum.
From '83 to '95: two percent per annum.
Since 1995: less than
one percent per annum.
The same profile in Japan.
The same profile in the US,
despite a momentary rebound 15 years ago,
and despite all
the technological innovations
around us: the Internet, the information,
the new information
and communication technologies.
When productivity grows
three percent per annum,
you double the standard of living
every generation.
Every generation is twice
as well-off as its parents'.
When it grows one percent per annum,
it takes three generations
to double the standard of living.
And in this process, many people
will be less well-off than their parents.
They will have less of everything:
smaller roofs, or perhaps no roof at all,
less access to education, to vitamins,
to antibiotics, to vaccination --
to everything.
Think of all the problems
that we're facing at the moment.
All.
Chances are that they are rooted
in the productivity crisis.
Why this crisis?
Because the basic tenets
about efficiency --
effectiveness in organizations,
in management --
have become counterproductive
for human efforts.
Everywhere in public services --
in companies, in the way we work,
the way we innovate, invest --
try to learn to work better.
Take the holy trinity of efficiency:
clarity, measurement, accountability.
They make human efforts derail.
There are two ways
to look at it, to prove it.
One, the one I prefer,
is rigorous, elegant, nice -- math.
But the full math version
takes a little while,
so there is another one.
It is to look at a relay race.
This is what we will do today.
It's a bit more animated, more visual
and also faster -- it's a race.
Hopefully, it's faster.
(Laughter)
World championship final -- women.
Eight teams in the final.
The fastest team is the US team.
They have the fastest women on earth.
They are the favorite team to win.
Notably, if you compare them
to an average team,
say, the French team,
(Laughter)
based on their best performances
in the 100-meter race,
if you add the individual times
of the US runners,
they arrive at the finish line
3.2 meters ahead of the French team.
And this year, the US team
is in great shape.
Based on their best performance this year,
they arrive 6.4 meters
ahead of the French team,
based on the data.
We are going to look at the race.
At some point you will see,
towards the end,
that Torri Edwards,
the fourth US runner, is ahead.
Not surprising -- this year she got
the gold medal in the 100-meter race.
And by the way, Chryste Gaines,
the second runner in the US team,
is the fastest woman on earth.
So, there are 3.5 billion women on earth.
Where are the two fastest? On the US team.
And the two other runners
on the US team are not bad, either.
(Laughter)
So clearly, the US team has won
the war for talent.
But behind, the average team
is trying to catch up.
Let's watch the race.
(Video: French sportscasters narrate race)
(Video: Race narration ends)
Yves Morieux: So what happened?
The fastest team did not win;
the slower one did.
By the way, I hope you appreciate
the deep historical research I did
to make the French look good.
(Laughter)
But let's not exaggerate --
it's not archeology, either.
(Laughter)
But why?
Because of cooperation.
When you hear this sentence:
"Thanks to cooperation, the whole
is worth more than the sum of the parts."
This is not poetry;
this is not philosophy.
This is math.
Those who carry the baton are slower,
but their baton is faster.
Miracle of cooperation:
it multiplies energy,
intelligence in human efforts.
It is the essence of human efforts:
how we work together, how each effort
contributes to the efforts of others.
With cooperation,
we can do more with less.
Now, what happens to cooperation
when the holy grail --
the holy trinity, even --
of clarity, measurement, accountability --
appears?
Clarity.
Management reports are full of complaints
about the lack of clarity.
Compliance audits,
consultants' diagnostics.
We need more clarity, we need
to clarify the roles, the processes.
It is as though the runners
on the team were saying,
"Let's be clear -- where does my role
really start and end?
Am I supposed to run for 95 meters,
96, 97...?"
It's important, let's be clear.
If you say 97, after 97 meters,
people will drop the baton, whether
there is someone to take it or not.
Accountability.
We are constantly trying
to put accountability
in someone's hands.
Who is accountable for this process?
We need somebody accountable
for this process.
So in the relay race,
since passing the baton is so important,
then we need somebody
clearly accountable for passing the baton.
So between each runner,
now we will have a new dedicated athlete,
clearly dedicated to taking
the baton from one runner,
and passing it to the next runner.
And we will have at least two like that.
Well, will we, in that case, win the race?
That I don't know, but for sure,
we would have a clear interface,
a clear line of accountability.
We will know who to blame.
But we'll never win the race.
If you think about it,
we pay more attention
to knowing who to blame in case we fail,
than to creating
the conditions to succeed.
All the human intelligence
put in organization design --
urban structures, processing systems --
what is the real goal?
To have somebody guilty in case they fail.
We are creating
organizations able to fail,
but in a compliant way,
with somebody clearly
accountable when we fail.
And we are quite effective
at that -- failing.
Measurement.
What gets measured gets done.
Look, to pass the baton,
you have to do it at the right time,
in the right hand, at the right speed.
But to do that, you have to put
energy in your arm.
This energy that is in your arm
will not be in your legs.
It will come at the expense
of your measurable speed.
You have to shout early enough
to the next runner
when you will pass the baton,
to signal that you are arriving,
so that the next runner
can prepare, can anticipate.
And you have to shout loud.
But the blood, the energy
that will be in your throat
will not be in your legs.
Because you know, there are
eight people shouting at the same time.
So you have to recognize the voice
of your colleague.
You cannot say, "Is it you?"
Too late!
(Laughter)
Now, let's look at the race
in slow motion,
and concentrate on the third runner.
Look at where she allocates her efforts,
her energy, her attention.
Not all in her legs -- that would
be great for her own speed --
but in also in her throat,
arm, eye, brain.
That makes a difference in whose legs?
In the legs of the next runner.
But when the next runner runs super-fast,
is it because she made a super effort,
or because of the way
the third runner passed the baton?
There is no metric on earth
that will give us the answer.
And if we reward people on the basis
of their measurable performance,
they will put their energy,
their attention, their blood
in what can get measured -- in their legs.
And the baton will fall and slow down.
To cooperate is not a super effort,
it is how you allocate your effort.
It is to take a risk,
because you sacrifice
the ultimate protection
granted by objectively measurable
individual performance.
It is to make a super difference
in the performance of others,
with whom we are compared.
It takes being stupid to cooperate, then.
And people are not stupid;
they don't cooperate.
You know, clarity, accountability,
measurement were OK
when the world was simpler.
But business has become much more complex.
With my teams, we have measured
the evolution of complexity in business.
It is much more demanding today
to attract and retain customers,
to build advantage on a global scale,
to create value.
And the more business gets complex,
the more, in the name of clarity,
accountability, measurement
we multiply structures,
processes, systems.
You know, this drive for clarity
and accountability triggers
a counterproductive multiplication
of interfaces, middle offices,
coordinators that do not only
mobilize people and resources,
but that also add obstacles.
And the more complicated the organization,
the more difficult it is to understand
what is really happening.
So we need summaries, proxies, reports,
key performance indicators, metrics.
So people put their energy
in what can get measured,
at the expense of cooperation.
And as performance deteriorates,
we add even more structure,
process, systems.
People spend their time in meetings,
writing reports they have
to do, undo and redo.
Based on our analysis,
teams in these organizations
spend between 40 and 80 percent
of their time wasting their time,
but working harder and harder,
longer and longer,
on less and less value-adding activities.
This is what is killing productivity,
what makes people suffer at work.
Our organizations are wasting
human intelligence.
They have turned against human efforts.
When people don't cooperate,
don't blame their mindsets,
their mentalities, their personality --
look at the work situations.
Is it really in their personal interest
to cooperate or not,
if, when they cooperate,
they are individually worse off?
Why would they cooperate?
When we blame personalities
instead of the clarity,
the accountability, the measurement,
we add injustice to ineffectiveness.
We need to create organizations
in which it becomes individually useful
for people to cooperate.
Remove the interfaces,
the middle offices --
all these complicated
coordination structures.
Don't look for clarity; go for fuzziness.
Fuzziness overlaps.
Remove most of the quantitative metrics
to assess performance.
Speed the "what."
Look at cooperation, the "how."
How did you pass the baton?
Did you throw it,
or did you pass it effectively?
Am I putting my energy
in what can get measured --
my legs, my speed --
or in passing the baton?
You, as leaders, as managers,
are you making it individually useful
for people to cooperate?
The future of our organizations,
our companies, our societies
hinges on your answer to these questions.
Thank you.
(Applause)

In October 2010,
the Justice League of America will be teaming up with The 99.
Icons like Batman,
Superman, Wonder Woman and their colleagues
will be teaming up with icons Jabbar, Noora,
Jami and their colleagues.
It's a story of intercultural intersections,
and what better group
to have this conversation
than those that grew out of fighting fascism
in their respective histories and geographies?
As fascism took over Europe in the 1930s,
an unlikely reaction came out of North America.
As Christian iconography got changed,
and swastikas were created out of crucifixes,
Batman and Superman were created by Jewish young men
in the United States and Canada,
also going back to the Bible.
Consider this:
like the prophets, all the superheroes
are missing parents.
Superman's parents die on Krypton
before the age of one.
Bruce Wayne, who becomes Batman,
loses his parents at the age of six in Gotham City.
Spiderman is raised
by his aunt and uncle.
And all of them, just like the prophets who get their message
from God through Gabriel,
get their message from above.
Peter Parker is in a library in Manhattan
when the spider descends from above
and gives him his message through a bite.
Bruce Wayne is in his bedroom
when a big bat flies over his head,
and he sees it as an omen to become Batman.
Superman is not only sent to Earth
from the heavens, or Krypton,
but he's sent in a pod, much like Moses was on the Nile.
(Laughter)
And you hear the voice of his father, Jor-El,
saying to Earth, "I have sent to you my only son."
(Laughter)
(Applause)
These are clearly biblical archetypes,
and the thinking behind that was to create
positive, globally-resonating storylines
that could be tied to the same things
that other people were pulling mean messages out of
because then the person that's using religion for the wrong purpose
just becomes a bad man with a bad message.
And it's only by linking positive things
that the negative can be delinked.
This is the kind of thinking that went into
creating The 99.
The 99 references the 99 attributes of Allah in the Koran,
things like generosity and mercy and foresight and wisdom
and dozens of others that no two people in the world would disagree about.
It doesn't matter what your religion is;
even if you're an atheist, you don't raise your kid telling him, you know,
"Make sure you lie three times a day."
Those are basic human values.
And so the backstory of The 99
takes place in 1258,
which history tells us the Mongols invaded Baghdad and destroyed it.
All the books from Bait al-Hikma library,
the most famous library in its day, were thrown in the Tigris River,
and the Tigris changes color with ink.
It's a story passed on generation after generation.
I rewrote that story,
and in my version, the librarians find out that this is going to happen --
and here's a side note:
if you want a comic book to do well, make the librarians the hero. It always works well.
(Laughter)
(Applause)
So the librarians find out
and they get together a special solution, a chemical solution called King's Water,
that when mixed with 99 stones
would be able to save all that culture and history in the books.
But the Mongols get there first.
The books and the solution get thrown in the Tigris River.
Some librarians escape, and over the course of days and weeks,
they dip the stones into the Tigris and suck up that collective wisdom
that we all think is lost to civilization.
Those stones have been smuggled as three prayer beads
of 33 stones each
through Arabia into Andalusia in Spain, where they're safe for 200 years.
But in 1492, two important things happen.
The first is the fall of Granada,
the last Muslim enclave in Europe.
The second is Columbus finally gets funded to go to India, but he gets lost.
(Laughter)
So 33 of the stones are smuggled
onto the Nina, the Pinta and the Santa Maria
and are spread in the New World.
Thirty-three go on the Silk Road to China, South Asia and Southeast Asia.
And 33 are spread between Europe, the Middle East and Africa.
And now it's 2010, and there are 99 heroes
from 99 different countries.
Now it's very easy to assume
that those books, because they were from a library called Bait al-Hikma, were Muslim books,
but that's not the case because the caliph that built that library,
his name was al-Ma'mun -- he was Harun al-Rashid's son.
He had told his advisers, "Get me all the scholars
to translate any book they can get their hands onto into Arabic,
and I will pay them its weight in gold."
After a while, his advisers complained.
They said, "Your Highness, the scholars are cheating.
They're writing in big handwriting to take more gold."
To which he said, "Let them be, because what they're giving us
is worth a lot more than what we're paying them."
So the idea of an open architecture, an open knowledge,
is not new to my neck of the desert.
The concept centers on something called the Noor stones.
Noor is Arabic for light.
So these 99 stones, a few kind of rules in the game:
Number one, you don't choose the stone; the stone chooses you.
There's a King Arthur element to the storyline, okay.
Number two, all of The 99,
when they first get their stone, or their power, abuse it;
they use it for self-interest.
And there's a very strong message in there that when you start abusing your stone,
you get taken advantage of
by people who will exploit your powers, okay.
Number three, the 99 stones all have within them
a mechanism that self-updates.
Now there are two groups that exist within the Muslim world.
Everybody believes the Koran is for all time and all place.
Some believe that means that the original interpretation
from a couple thousand years ago is what's relevant today.
I don't belong there.
Then there's a group that believes the Koran is a living, breathing document,
and I captured that idea within these stones that self-update.
Now the main bad guy, Rughal,
does not want these stones to update,
so he's trying to get them to stop updating.
He can't use the stones, but he can stop them.
And by stopping them, he has more of a fascist agenda,
where he gets some of The 99 to work for him --
they're all wearing cookie-cutter, same color uniforms
They're not allowed to individually express who they are and what they are.
And he controls them from the top down --
whereas when they work for the other side, eventually,
when they find out this is the wrong person, they've been manipulated,
they actually, each one has a different, colorful
kind of dress.
And the last point about the 99 Noor stones is this.
So The 99 work in teams of three.
Why three? A couple of reasons.
Number one, we have a thing within Islam that you don't leave a boy and a girl alone together,
because the third person is temptation or the devil, right?
I think that's there in all cultures, right?
But this is not about religion, it's not about proselytizing.
There's this very strong social message
that needs to get to kind of
the deepest crevices of intolerance,
and the only way to get there is to kind of play the game.
And so this is the way I dealt with it.
They work in teams of three: two boys and a girl, two girls and a boy,
three boys, three girls, no problem.
And the Swiss psychoanalyst, Carl Jung, also spoke about
the importance of the number three in all cultures, so I figure I'm covered.
Well ...
I got accused in a few blogs that I was actually sent by the Pope
to preach the Trinity and Catholicism in the Middle East,
so you -- (Laughter)
you believe who you want. I gave you my version of the story.
So here's some of the characters that we have.
Mujiba, from Malaysia: her main power is she's able to answer any question.
She's the Trivial Pursuit queen, if you want,
but when she first gets her power,
she starts going on game shows and making money.
We have Jabbar from Saudi who starts breaking things when he has the power.
Now, Mumita was a fun one to name. Mumita is the destroyer.
So the 99 attributes of Allah have the yin and the yang;
there's the powerful, the hegemonous, the strong,
and there's also the kind, the generous.
I'm like, are all the girls going to be kind and merciful and the guys all strong?
I'm like, you know what, I've met a few girls who were destroyers in my lifetime, so ...
(Laughter)
We have Jami from Hungary, who first starts making weapons:
He's the technology wiz.
Musawwira from Ghana,
Hadya from Pakistan, Jaleel from Iran who uses fire.
And this is one of my favorites, Al-Batina from Yemen.
Al-Batina is the hidden.
So Al-Batina is hidden, but she's a superhero.
I came home to my wife and I said, "I created a character after you."
My wife is a Saudi from Yemeni roots.
And she said, "Show me." So I showed this.
She said, "That's not me."
I said, "Look at the eyes. They're your eyes."
(Laughter)
So I promised my investors this would not be another made-in-fifth-world-country production.
This was going to be Superman, or it wasn't worth my time or their money.
So from day one, the people involved in the project,
bottom left is Fabian Nicieza,
writer for X-Men and Power Rangers.
Next to him is Dan Panosian,
one of the character creators for the modern-day X-Men.
Top right is Stuart Moore, a writer for Iron Man.
Next to him is John McCrea, who was an inker for Spiderman.
And we entered Western consciousness
with a tagline: "Next Ramadan, the world will have new heroes,"
back in 2005.
Now I went to Dubai, to an Arab Thought Foundation Conference,
and I was waiting by the coffee for the right journalist.
Didn't have a product, but had energy.
And I found somebody from The New York Times,
and I cornered him, and I pitched him.
And I think I scared him -- (Laughter)
because he basically promised me --
we had no product -- but he said, "We'll give you a paragraph in the arts section
if you'll just go away."
(Laughter)
So I said, "Great." So I called him up a few weeks afterward.
I said, "Hi, Hesa." And he said, "Hi." I said, "Happy New Year."
He said, "Thank you. We had a baby." I said, "Congratulations."
Like I care, right?
"So when's the article coming out?"
He said, "Naif, Islam and cartoon?
That's not timely.
You know, maybe next week, next month, next year, but, you know, it'll come out."
So a few days after that, what happens?
What happens is the world erupts in the Danish cartoon controversy.
I became timely.
(Laughter)
So flurry of phone calls and emails from The New York Times.
Next thing you knew, there's a full page covering us positively,
January 22nd, 2006,
which changed our lives forever,
because anybody Googling Islam and cartoon or Islam and comic,
guess what they got; they got me.
And The 99 were like superheroes
kind of flying out of what was happening around the world.
And that led to all kinds of things,
from being in curricula in universities and schools to --
one of my favorite pictures I have from South Asia,
it was a couple of men with long beards
and a lot of girls wearing the hijab -- it looked like a school.
The good news is they're all holding copies of The 99, smiling,
and they found me to sign the picture.
The bad news is they were all photocopies, so we didn't make a dime in revenue.
(Laughter)
We've been able to license The 99 comic books
into eight languages so far --
Chinese, Indonesian, Hindi, Urdu, Turkish.
Opened a theme park through a license in Kuwait a year and a half ago
called The 99 Village Theme Park --
300,000 square feet, 20 rides, all with our characters:
a couple back-to-school licenses in Spain and Turkey.
But the biggest thing we've done to date, which is just amazing,
is that we've done a 26-episode animated series,
which is done for global audiences:
in fact, we're already going to be in the U.S. and Turkey, we know.
It's 3D CGI, which is going to be very high-quality,
written in Hollywood by the writers behind Ben 10
and Spiderman and Star Wars: Clone Wars.
In this clip I'm about to show you, which has never been seen in the public before,
there is a struggle.
Two of the characters, Jabbar, the one with the muscles,
and Noora, the one that can use light,
are actually wearing the cookie-cutter fascist gray uniform
because they're being manipulated.
They don't know, OK,
and they're trying to get another member of The 99 to join them.
So there's a struggle within the team.
So if we can get the lights ...
["The 99"]
Jabbar: Dana, I can't see where to grab hold.
I need more light.
What's happening?
Dana: There's too much darkness.
Rughal: There must be something we can do.
Man: I won't send any more commandos in
until I know it's safe.
Dr. Razem: It's time to go, Miklos.
Miklos: Must download file contents.
I can't forget auntie.
Jabbar: Dana, I can't do this without you.
Dana: But I can't help.
Jabbar: You can,
even if you don't believe in yourself right now.
I believe in you.
You are Noora the Light.
Dana: No.
I don't deserve it. I don't deserve anything.
Jabbar: Then what about the rest of us?
Don't we deserve to be saved? Don't I?
Now, tell me which way to go.
Dana: That way.
Alarm: Threat imminent.
Jabbar: Aaaahhh!
Miklos: Stay away from me.
Jabbar: We're here to help you.
Dr. Razem: Don't listen to them.
Dana: Miklos, that man is not your friend.
Miklos: No. He gave me access,
and you want to reboot the [unclear]. No more [unclear].
["The 99"]
Thank you.
(Applause)
So "The 99" is technology; it's entertainment;
it's design.
But that's only half the story.
As the father of five sons,
I worry about who they're going to be using as role models.
I worry because all around me, even within my extended family,
I see religion being manipulated.
As a psychologist, I worry
for the world in general,
but worry about the perception of how people see themselves
in my part of the world.
Now, I'm a clinical psychologist. I'm licensed in New York State.
I trained at Bellevue Hospital Survivors of Political Torture Program,
and I heard one too many stories of people growing up
to idolize their leadership,
only to end up being tortured by their heroes.
And torture's a terrible enough thing as it is, but when it's done by your hero,
that just breaks you in so many ways.
I left Bellevue, went to business school and started this.
Now, one of the things that I refer to
when I -- about the importance of this message --
is that I gave a lecture at the medical school at Kuwait University,
where I lecture on the biological basis of behavior,
and I gave the students two articles, one from The New York Times
and one from New York magazine.
And I took away the name of the writer, the name of the [unclear] -- everything was gone except the facts.
And the first one was about a group called The Party of God,
who wanted to ban Valentine's Day. Red was made illegal.
Any boys and girls caught flirting
would get married off immediately, okay.
The second one was about a woman complaining
because three minivans with six bearded men pulled up
and started interrogating her on the spot
for talking to a man who wasn't related to her.
And I asked the students in Kuwait where they thought these incidents took place.
The first one, they said Saudi Arabia. There was no debate.
The second one, they were actually split
between Saudi and Afghanistan.
What blew their mind was the first one took place in India,
it was the party of a Hindu God.
The second one took place in upstate New York.
It was an Orthodox Jewish community.
But what breaks my heart and what's alarming
is that in those two interviews,
the people around, who were interviewed as well,
refer to that behavior as Talibanization.
In other words, good Hindus and good Jews don't act this way.
This is Islam's influence on Hinduism and Judaism.
But what do the students in Kuwait say? They said it's us --
and this is dangerous.
It's dangerous when a group self-identifies itself
as extreme.
This is one of my sons, Rayan,
who's a Scooby Doo addict.
You can tell by the glasses there.
He actually called me a meddling kid the other day.
(Laughter)
But I borrow a lesson that I learned from him.
Last summer when we were in our home in New York,
he was out in the yard playing in his playhouse. And I was in my office working,
and he came in, "Baba, I want you to come with me. I want my toy."
"Yes, Rayan, just go away." He left his Scooby Doo in his house.
I said, "Go away. I'm working. I'm busy."
And what Rayan did then
is he sat there, he tapped his foot on the floor, at three and a half,
and he looked at me and he said, "Baba,
I want you to come with me to my office in my house.
I have work to do."
(Laughter)
(Applause)
Rayan reframed the situation
and brought himself down to my level.
(Laughter)
And with The 99, that is what we aim to do.
You know, I think that there's a big parallel
between bending the crucifix out of shape
and creating swastikas.
And when I see pictures like this, of parents or uncles
who think it's cute to have a little child
holding a Koran and having a suicide bomber belt around them
to protest something,
the hope is by linking enough positive things
to the Koran,
that one day we can move this child
from being proud in the way they're proud there,
to that.
And I think --
I think The 99
can and will achieve its mission.
As an undergrad at Tufts University, we were giving away free falafel one day
and, you know, it was Middle East Day or something.
And people came up and picked up
the culturally resonant image of the falafel,
ate it and, you know, talked and left.
And no two people could disagree about what the word free was
and what the word falafel was, behind us, "free falafel." You know.
(Laughter)
Or so we thought,
until a woman came rushing across the campus
and dropped her bag on the floor, pointed up to the sign and said,
"Who's falafel?"
(Laughter)
True story.
(Laughter)
She was actually coming out of an Amnesty International meeting.
(Laughter)
Just today, D.C. Comics announced
the cover of our upcoming crossover.
On that cover you see Batman, Superman
and a fully-clothed Wonder Woman
with our Saudi member of The 99,
our Emirati member and our Libyan member.
On April 26, 2010,
President Barack Obama said that
of all the initiatives since his now famous Cairo speech --
in which he reached out to the Muslim world --
the most innovative was that The 99 reach back out
to the Justice League of America.
We live in a world in which the most culturally innocuous symbols,
like the falafel, can be misunderstood because of baggage,
and where religion can be twisted
and purposefully made where it's not supposed to be by others.
In a world like that,
they'll always be a job for Superman and The 99.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
I'm here to enlist you
in helping reshape the story about how humans and other critters get things done.
Here is the old story -- we've already heard a little bit about it:
biology is war in which only the fiercest survive;
businesses and nations succeed only by defeating,
destroying and dominating competition;
politics is about your side winning at all costs.
But I think we can see the very beginnings of a new story beginning to emerge.
It's a narrative spread across a number of different disciplines,
in which cooperation, collective action and complex interdependencies
play a more important role.
And the central, but not all-important, role of competition and survival of the fittest
shrinks just a little bit to make room.
I started thinking about the relationship between communication, media
and collective action when I wrote "Smart Mobs,"
and I found that when I finished the book, I kept thinking about it.
In fact, if you look back, human communication media
and the ways in which we organize socially have been co-evolving for quite a long time.
Humans have lived for much, much longer
than the approximately 10,000 years of settled agricultural civilization
in small family groups. Nomadic hunters bring down rabbits, gathering food.
The form of wealth in those days was enough food to stay alive.
But at some point, they banded together to hunt bigger game.
And we don't know exactly how they did this,
although they must have solved some collective action problems;
it only makes sense that you can't hunt mastodons
while you're fighting with the other groups.
And again, we have no way of knowing,
but it's clear that a new form of wealth must have emerged.
More protein than a hunter's family could eat before it rotted.
So that raised a social question
that I believe must have driven new social forms.
Did the people who ate that mastodon meat owe something
to the hunters and their families?
And if so, how did they make arrangements?
Again, we can't know, but we can be pretty sure that some form of
symbolic communication must have been involved.
Of course, with agriculture came the first big civilizations,
the first cities built of mud and brick, the first empires.
And it was the administers of these empires
who began hiring people to keep track of the wheat and sheep and wine that was owed
and the taxes that was owed on them
by making marks; marks on clay in that time.
Not too much longer after that, the alphabet was invented.
And this powerful tool was really reserved, for thousands of years,
for the elite administrators (Laughter) who kept track of accounts for the empires.
And then another communication technology enabled new media:
the printing press came along, and within decades,
millions of people became literate.
And from literate populations,
new forms of collective action emerged in the spheres of knowledge,
religion and politics.
We saw scientific revolutions, the Protestant Reformation,
constitutional democracies possible where they had not been possible before.
Not created by the printing press,
but enabled by the collective action that emerges from literacy.
And again, new forms of wealth emerged.
Now, commerce is ancient. Markets are as old as the crossroads.
But capitalism, as we know it, is only a few hundred years old,
enabled by cooperative arrangements and technologies,
such as the joint-stock ownership company,
shared liability insurance, double-entry bookkeeping.
Now of course, the enabling technologies are based on the Internet,
and in the many-to-many era, every desktop is now a printing press,
a broadcasting station, a community or a marketplace.
Evolution is speeding up.
More recently, that power is untethering and leaping off the desktops,
and very, very quickly, we're going to see a significant proportion, if not the majority of
the human race, walking around holding, carrying or wearing supercomputers
linked at speeds greater
than what we consider to be broadband today.
Now, when I started looking into collective action,
the considerable literature on it is based on what sociologists call "social dilemmas."
And there are a couple of mythic narratives of social dilemmas.
I'm going to talk briefly about two of them:
the prisoner's dilemma and the tragedy of the commons.
Now, when I talked about this with Kevin Kelly,
he assured me that everybody in this audience pretty much knows the details
of the prisoner's dilemma,
so I'm just going to go over that very, very quickly.
If you have more questions about it, ask Kevin Kelly later. (Laughter)
The prisoner's dilemma is actually a story that's overlaid
on a mathematical matrix that came out of the game theory
in the early years of thinking about nuclear war:
two players who couldn't trust each other.
Let me just say that every unsecured transaction
is a good example of a prisoner's dilemma.
Person with the goods, person with the money,
because they can't trust each other, are not going to exchange.
Neither one wants to be the first one
or they're going to get the sucker's payoff,
but both lose, of course, because they don't get what they want.
If they could only agree, if they could only turn a prisoner's dilemma into
a different payoff matrix called an assurance game, they could proceed.
Twenty years ago, Robert Axelrod used the prisoner's dilemma
as a probe of the biological question:
if we are here because our ancestors were such fierce competitors,
how does cooperation exist at all?
He started a computer tournament for
people to submit prisoner's dilemma strategies and discovered,
much to his surprise, that a very, very simple strategy won --
it won the first tournament, and even after everyone knew it won,
it won the second tournament -- that's known as tit for tat.
Another economic game that may not be as well known as the prisoner's dilemma
is the ultimatum game,
and it's also a very interesting probe of
our assumptions about the way people make economic transactions.
Here's how the game is played: there are two players;
they've never played the game before,
they will not play the game again, they don't know each other,
and they are, in fact, in separate rooms.
First player is offered a hundred dollars
and is asked to propose a split: 50/50, 90/10,
whatever that player wants to propose. The second player either accepts the split --
both players are paid and the game is over --
or rejects the split -- neither player is paid and the game is over.
Now, the fundamental basis of neoclassical economics
would tell you it's irrational to reject a dollar
because someone you don't know in another room is going to get 99.
Yet in thousands of trials with American and European and Japanese students,
a significant percentage would reject any offer that's not close to 50/50.
And although they were screened and didn't know about the game
and had never played the game before,
proposers seemed to innately know this
because the average proposal was surprisingly close to 50/50.
Now, the interesting part comes in more recently
when anthropologists began taking this game to other cultures
and discovered, to their surprise,
that slash-and-burn agriculturalists in the Amazon
or nomadic pastoralists in Central Asia or a dozen different cultures --
each had radically different ideas of what is fair.
Which suggests that instead of there being an innate sense of fairness,
that somehow the basis of our economic
transactions can be influenced by our social institutions,
whether we know that or not.
The other major narrative of social dilemmas is the tragedy of the commons.
Garrett Hardin used it to talk about overpopulation in the late 1960s.
He used the example of a common grazing area in which each person
by simply maximizing their own flock
led to overgrazing and the depletion of the resource.
He had the rather gloomy conclusion that
humans will inevitably despoil any common pool resource
in which people cannot be restrained from using it.
Now, Elinor Ostrom, a political scientist, in
1990 asked the interesting question that any good scientist should ask,
which is: is it really true that humans will always despoil commons?
So she went out and looked at what data she could find.
She looked at thousands of cases of humans sharing watersheds,
forestry resources, fisheries, and discovered that yes, in case after case,
humans destroyed the commons that they depended on.
But she also found many instances in which people escaped the prisoner's dilemma;
in fact, the tragedy of the commons is a multiplayer prisoner's dilemma.
And she said that people are only prisoners if they consider themselves to be.
They escape by creating institutions for collective action.
And she discovered, I think most interestingly,
that among those institutions that worked,
there were a number of common design
principles, and those principles seem to be
missing from those institutions that don't work.
I'm moving very quickly over a number of
disciplines. In biology, the notions of symbiosis,
group selection, evolutionary psychology are contested, to be sure.
But there is really no longer any major debate over the fact that
cooperative arrangements have moved from a peripheral role to a central role

in biology, from the level of the cell to the level of the ecology.
And again, our notions of individuals as economic beings
have been overturned.
Rational self-interest is not always the dominating factor.
In fact, people will act to punish cheaters, even at a cost to themselves.
And most recently, neurophysiological measures
have shown that people who punish cheaters in economic games
show activity in the reward centers of their brain.
Which led one scientist to declare that altruistic punishment
may be the glue that holds societies together.
Now, I've been talking about how new forms of communication and new media
in the past have helped create new economic forms.
Commerce is ancient. Markets are very old. Capitalism is fairly recent;
socialism emerged as a reaction to that.
And yet we see very little talk about how the next form may be emerging.
Jim Surowiecki briefly mentioned Yochai Benkler's paper about open source,
pointing to a new form of production: peer-to-peer production.
I simply want you to keep in mind that if in the past, new forms of cooperation
enabled by new technologies create new forms of wealth,
we may be moving into yet another economic form
that is significantly different from previous ones.
Very briefly, let's look at some businesses. IBM, as you know, HP, Sun --
some of the most fierce competitors in the IT world are open sourcing
their software, are providing portfolios of patents for the commons.
Eli Lilly -- in, again, the fiercely competitive pharmaceutical world --
has created a market for solutions for pharmaceutical problems.
Toyota, instead of treating its suppliers as a marketplace,
treats them as a network and trains them to produce better,
even though they are also training them to produce better for their competitors.
Now none of these companies are doing this out of altruism;
they're doing it because they're learning that
a certain kind of sharing is in their self-interest.
Open source production has shown us that world-class software, like Linux and Mozilla,
can be created with neither the bureaucratic structure of the firm
nor the incentives of the marketplace as we've known them.
Google enriches itself by enriching thousands of bloggers through AdSense.
Amazon has opened its Application Programming Interface
to 60,000 developers, countless Amazon shops.
They're enriching others, not out of altruism but as a way of enriching themselves.
eBay solved the prisoner's dilemma and created a market
where none would have existed by creating a feedback mechanism
that turns a prisoner's dilemma game into an assurance game.
Instead of, "Neither of us can trust each other, so we have to make suboptimal moves,"
it's, "You prove to me that you are trustworthy and I will cooperate."
Wikipedia has used thousands of volunteers to create a free encyclopedia
with a million and a half articles in 200 languages in just a couple of years.
We've seen that ThinkCycle has enabled NGOs in developing countries
to put up problems to be solved by design students around the world,
including something that's being used for tsunami relief right now:
it's a mechanism for rehydrating
cholera victims that's so simple to use it,
illiterates can be trained to use it.
BitTorrent turns every downloader into an uploader,
making the system more efficient the more it is used.
Millions of people have contributed their desktop computers
when they're not using them to link together through the Internet
into supercomputing collectives
that help solve the protein folding problem for medical researchers --
that's Folding@home at Stanford --
to crack codes, to search for life in outer space.
I don't think we know enough yet.
I don't think we've even begun to discover what the basic principles are,
but I think we can begin to think about them.
And I don't have enough time to talk about all of them,
but think about self-interest.
This is all about self-interest that adds up to more.
In El Salvador, both sides that withdrew from their civil war
took moves that had been proven to mirror a prisoner's dilemma strategy.
In the U.S., in the Philippines, in Kenya, around the world,
citizens have self-organized political protests and
get out the vote campaigns using mobile devices and SMS.
Is an Apollo Project of cooperation possible?
A transdisciplinary study of cooperation?
I believe that the payoff would be very big.
I think we need to begin developing maps of this territory
so that we can talk about it across disciplines.
And I am not saying that understanding cooperation 

is going to cause us to be better people --
and sometimes people cooperate to do bad things --
but I will remind you that a few hundred years ago,
people saw their loved ones die from diseases they thought
were caused by sin or foreigners or evil spirits.
Descartes said we need an entire new way of thinking.
When the scientific method provided that new way of thinking
and biology showed that microorganisms caused disease,
suffering was alleviated.
What forms of suffering could be alleviated,
what forms of wealth could be created
if we knew a little bit more about cooperation?
I don't think that this transdisciplinary discourse
is automatically going to happen;
it's going to require effort.
So I enlist you to help me get the cooperation project started.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Back in New York, I am the head of development
for a non-profit called Robin Hood.
When I'm not fighting poverty, I'm fighting fires
as the assistant captain of a volunteer fire company.
Now in our town,
where the volunteers supplement a highly skilled career staff,
you have to get to the fire scene pretty early
to get in on any action.
I remember my first fire.
I was the second volunteer on the scene,
so there was a pretty good chance I was going to get in.
But still it was a real footrace against the other volunteers
to get to the captain in charge
to find out what our assignments would be.
When I found the captain,
he was having a very engaging conversation
with the homeowner,
who was surely having one of the worst days of her life.
Here it was, the middle of the night,
she was standing outside in the pouring rain,
under an umbrella, in her pajamas, barefoot,
while her house was in flames.
The other volunteer who had arrived just before me --
let's call him Lex Luther --
(Laughter)
got to the captain first
and was asked to go inside
and save the homeowner's dog.
The dog! I was stunned with jealousy.
Here was some lawyer or money manager
who, for the rest of his life, gets to tell people
that he went into a burning building
to save a living creature,
just because he beat me by five seconds.
Well, I was next.
The captain waved me over.
He said, "Bezos, I need you to go into the house.
I need you to go upstairs, past the fire,
and I need you to get this woman a pair of shoes."
(Laughter)
I swear.
So, not exactly what I was hoping for,
but off I went --
up the stairs, down the hall, past the 'real' firefighters,
who were pretty much done putting out the fire at this point,
into the master bedroom to get a pair of shoes.
Now I know what you're thinking,
but I'm no hero.
(Laughter)
I carried my payload back downstairs
where I met my nemesis
and the precious dog by the front door.
We took our treasures outside to the homeowner,
where, not surprisingly,
his received much more attention than did mine.
A few weeks later,
the department received a letter from the homeowner
thanking us for the valiant effort displayed
in saving her home.
The act of kindness she noted above all others:
someone had even gotten her a pair of shoes.
(Laughter)
In both my vocation at Robin Hood
and my avocation as a volunteer firefighter,
I am witness to acts of generosity and kindness
on a monumental scale,
but I'm also witness to acts of grace and courage
on an individual basis.
And you know what I've learned?
They all matter.
So as I look around this room
at people who either have achieved,
or are on their way to achieving,
remarkable levels of success,
I would offer this reminder:
don't wait.
Don't wait until you make your first million
to make a difference in somebody's life.
If you have something to give,
give it now.
Serve food at a soup kitchen. Clean up a neighborhood park.
Be a mentor.
Not every day is going to offer us a chance
to save somebody's life,
but every day offers us an opportunity to affect one.
So get in the game. Save the shoes.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Bruno Giussani: Mark, Mark, come back.
(Applause)
Mark Bezos: Thank you.
So, imagine you're standing on a street anywhere in America
and a Japanese man comes up to you and says,
"Excuse me, what is the name of this block?"
And you say, "I'm sorry, well, this is Oak Street, that's Elm Street.
This is 26th, that's 27th."
He says, "OK, but what is the name of that block?"
You say, "Well, blocks don't have names.
Streets have names; blocks are just the
unnamed spaces in between streets."
He leaves, a little confused and disappointed.
So, now imagine you're standing on a street, anywhere in Japan,
you turn to a person next to you and say,
"Excuse me, what is the name of this street?"
They say, "Oh, well that's Block 17 and this is Block 16."
And you say, "OK, but what is the name of this street?"
And they say, "Well, streets don't have names.
Blocks have names.
Just look at Google Maps here. There's Block 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19.
All of these blocks have names,
and the streets are just the unnamed spaces in between the blocks.
And you say then, "OK, then how do you know your home address?"
He said, "Well, easy, this is District Eight.
There's Block 17, house number one."
You say, "OK, but walking around the neighborhood,
I noticed that the house numbers don't go in order."
He says, "Of course they do. They go in the order in which they were built.
The first house ever built on a block is house number one.
The second house ever built is house number two.
Third is house number three. It's easy. It's obvious."
So, I love that sometimes we need to
go to the opposite side of the world
to realize assumptions we didn't even know we had,
and realize that the opposite of them may also be true.
So, for example, there are doctors in China
who believe that it's their job to keep you healthy.
So, any month you are healthy you pay them,
and when you're sick you don't have to pay them because they failed
at their job. They get rich when you're healthy, not sick.
(Applause)
In most music, we think of the "one"
as the downbeat, the beginning of the musical phrase: one, two, three, four.
But in West African music, the "one"
is thought of as the end of the phrase,
like the period at the end of a sentence.
So, you can hear it not just in the phrasing, but the way they count off their music:
two, three, four, one.
And this map is also accurate.
(Laughter)
There's a saying that whatever true thing you can say about India,
the opposite is also true.
So, let's never forget, whether at TED, or anywhere else,
that whatever brilliant ideas you have or hear,
that the opposite may also be true.
Domo arigato gozaimashita.
How does the news shape the way we see the world?
Here's the world based on the way it looks -- based on landmass.
And here's how news shapes what Americans see.
This map -- (Applause) -- this map shows the number of seconds
that American network and cable news organizations dedicated to news stories,
by country, in February of 2007 -- just one year ago.
Now, this was a month when North Korea agreed to dismantle its nuclear facilities.
There was massive flooding in Indonesia.
And in Paris, the IPCC released its study confirming man's impact on global warming.
The U.S. accounted for 79 percent of total news coverage.
And when we take out the U.S. and look at the remaining 21 percent,
we see a lot of Iraq -- that's that big green thing there -- and little else.
The combined coverage of Russia, China and India, for example, reached just one percent.
When we analyzed all the news stories and removed just one story,
here's how the world looked.
What was that story? The death of Anna Nicole Smith.
This story eclipsed every country except Iraq,
and received 10 times the coverage of the IPCC report.
And the cycle continues;
as we all know, Britney has loomed pretty large lately.
So, why don't we hear more about the world?
One reason is that news networks have reduced the number of their foreign bureaus by half.
Aside from one-person ABC mini-bureaus in Nairobi, New Delhi and Mumbai,
there are no network news bureaus in all of Africa, India or South America
-- places that are home to more than two billion people.
The reality is that covering Britney is cheaper.
And this lack of global coverage is all the more disturbing
when we see where people go for news.
Local TV news looms large,
and unfortunately only dedicates 12 percent of its coverage to international news.
And what about the web?
The most popular news sites don't do much better.
Last year, Pew and the Colombia J-School analyzed the 14,000 stories
that appeared on Google News' front page.
And they, in fact, covered the same 24 news events.
Similarly, a study in e-content showed that much of global news from U.S. news creators
is recycled stories from the AP wire services and Reuters,
and don't put things into a context that people can understand their connection to it.
So, if you put it all together, this could help explain why today's college graduates,
as well as less educated Americans,
know less about the world than their counterparts did 20 years ago.
And if you think it's simply because we are not interested,
you would be wrong.
In recent years, Americans who say they closely follow global news most of the time
grew to over 50 percent.
The real question: is this distorted worldview what we want for Americans
in our increasingly interconnected world?
I know we can do better.
And can we afford not to? Thank you.
What keeps us healthy and happy
as we go through life?
If you were going to invest now
in your future best self,
where would you put your time
and your energy?
There was a recent survey of millennials
asking them what their
most important life goals were,
and over 80 percent said
that a major life goal for them
was to get rich.
And another 50 percent
of those same young adults
said that another major life goal
was to become famous.
(Laughter)
And we're constantly told
to lean in to work, to push harder
and achieve more.
We're given the impression that these
are the things that we need to go after
in order to have a good life.
Pictures of entire lives,
of the choices that people make
and how those choices work out for them,
those pictures
are almost impossible to get.
Most of what we know about human life
we know from asking people
to remember the past,
and as we know, hindsight
is anything but 20/20.
We forget vast amounts
of what happens to us in life,
and sometimes memory
is downright creative.
But what if we could watch entire lives
as they unfold through time?
What if we could study people
from the time that they were teenagers
all the way into old age
to see what really keeps people
happy and healthy?
We did that.
The Harvard Study of Adult Development
may be the longest study
of adult life that's ever been done.
For 75 years, we've tracked
the lives of 724 men,
year after year, asking about their work,
their home lives, their health,
and of course asking all along the way
without knowing how their life stories
were going to turn out.
Studies like this are exceedingly rare.
Almost all projects of this kind
fall apart within a decade
because too many people
drop out of the study,
or funding for the research dries up,
or the researchers get distracted,
or they die, and nobody moves the ball
further down the field.
But through a combination of luck
and the persistence
of several generations of researchers,
this study has survived.
About 60 of our original 724 men
are still alive,
still participating in the study,
most of them in their 90s.
And we are now beginning to study
the more than 2,000 children of these men.
And I'm the fourth director of the study.
Since 1938, we've tracked the lives
of two groups of men.
The first group started in the study
when they were sophomores
at Harvard College.
They all finished college
during World War II,
and then most went off
to serve in the war.
And the second group that we've followed
was a group of boys
from Boston's poorest neighborhoods,
boys who were chosen for the study
specifically because they were
from some of the most troubled
and disadvantaged families
in the Boston of the 1930s.
Most lived in tenements,
many without hot and cold running water.
When they entered the study,
all of these teenagers were interviewed.
They were given medical exams.
We went to their homes
and we interviewed their parents.
And then these teenagers
grew up into adults
who entered all walks of life.
They became factory workers and lawyers
and bricklayers and doctors,
one President of the United States.
Some developed alcoholism.
A few developed schizophrenia.
Some climbed the social ladder
from the bottom
all the way to the very top,
and some made that journey
in the opposite direction.
The founders of this study
would never in their wildest dreams
have imagined that I would be
standing here today, 75 years later,
telling you that
the study still continues.
Every two years, our patient
and dedicated research staff
calls up our men
and asks them if we can send them
yet one more set of questions
about their lives.
Many of the inner city Boston men ask us,
"Why do you keep wanting to study me?
My life just isn't that interesting."
The Harvard men never ask that question.
(Laughter)
To get the clearest picture
of these lives,
we don't just send them questionnaires.
We interview them in their living rooms.
We get their medical records
from their doctors.
We draw their blood, we scan their brains,
we talk to their children.
We videotape them talking with their wives
about their deepest concerns.
And when, about a decade ago,
we finally asked the wives
if they would join us
as members of the study,
many of the women said,
"You know, it's about time."
(Laughter)
So what have we learned?
What are the lessons that come
from the tens of thousands of pages
of information that we've generated
on these lives?
Well, the lessons aren't about wealth
or fame or working harder and harder.
The clearest message that we get
from this 75-year study is this:
Good relationships keep us
happier and healthier. Period.
We've learned three big lessons
about relationships.
The first is that social connections
are really good for us,
and that loneliness kills.
It turns out that people
who are more socially connected
to family, to friends, to community,
are happier, they're physically healthier,
and they live longer
than people who are less well connected.
And the experience of loneliness
turns out to be toxic.
People who are more isolated
than they want to be from others
find that they are less happy,
their health declines earlier in midlife,
their brain functioning declines sooner
and they live shorter lives
than people who are not lonely.
And the sad fact
is that at any given time,
more than one in five Americans
will report that they're lonely.
And we know that you
can be lonely in a crowd
and you can be lonely in a marriage,
so the second big lesson that we learned
is that it's not just
the number of friends you have,
and it's not whether or not
you're in a committed relationship,
but it's the quality
of your close relationships that matters.
It turns out that living in the midst
of conflict is really bad for our health.
High-conflict marriages, for example,
without much affection,
turn out to be very bad for our health,
perhaps worse than getting divorced.
And living in the midst of good,
warm relationships is protective.
Once we had followed our men
all the way into their 80s,
we wanted to look back at them at midlife
and to see if we could predict
who was going to grow
into a happy, healthy octogenarian
and who wasn't.
And when we gathered together
everything we knew about them
at age 50,
it wasn't their middle age
cholesterol levels
that predicted how they
were going to grow old.
It was how satisfied they were
in their relationships.
The people who were the most satisfied
in their relationships at age 50
were the healthiest at age 80.
And good, close relationships
seem to buffer us
from some of the slings and arrows
of getting old.
Our most happily partnered men and women
reported, in their 80s,
that on the days
when they had more physical pain,
their mood stayed just as happy.
But the people who were
in unhappy relationships,
on the days when they
reported more physical pain,
it was magnified by more emotional pain.
And the third big lesson that we learned
about relationships and our health
is that good relationships
don't just protect our bodies,
they protect our brains.
It turns out that being
in a securely attached relationship
to another person in your 80s
is protective,
that the people who are in relationships
where they really feel they can count
on the other person in times of need,
those people's memories
stay sharper longer.
And the people in relationships
where they feel they really
can't count on the other one,
those are the people who experience
earlier memory decline.
And those good relationships,
they don't have to be smooth all the time.
Some of our octogenarian couples
could bicker with each other
day in and day out,
but as long as they felt that they
could really count on the other
when the going got tough,
those arguments didn't take a toll
on their memories.
So this message,
that good, close relationships
are good for our health and well-being,
this is wisdom that's as old as the hills.
Why is this so hard to get
and so easy to ignore?
Well, we're human.
What we'd really like is a quick fix,
something we can get
that'll make our lives good
and keep them that way.
Relationships are messy
and they're complicated
and the hard work of tending
to family and friends,
it's not sexy or glamorous.
It's also lifelong. It never ends.
The people in our 75-year study
who were the happiest in retirement
were the people who had actively worked
to replace workmates with new playmates.
Just like the millennials
in that recent survey,
many of our men when they
were starting out as young adults
really believed that fame and wealth
and high achievement
were what they needed to go after
to have a good life.
But over and over, over these 75 years,
our study has shown
that the people who fared the best were
the people who leaned in to relationships,
with family, with friends, with community.
So what about you?
Let's say you're 25,
or you're 40, or you're 60.
What might leaning in
to relationships even look like?
Well, the possibilities
are practically endless.
It might be something as simple
as replacing screen time with people time
or livening up a stale relationship
by doing something new together,
long walks or date nights,
or reaching out to that family member
who you haven't spoken to in years,
because those all-too-common family feuds
take a terrible toll
on the people who hold the grudges.
I'd like to close with a quote
from Mark Twain.
More than a century ago,
he was looking back on his life,
and he wrote this:
"There isn't time, so brief is life,
for bickerings, apologies,
heartburnings, callings to account.
There is only time for loving,
and but an instant,
so to speak, for that."
The good life is built
with good relationships.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Welcome to Bayeku,
a riverine community in Ikorodu, Lagos --
a vivid representation of several
riverine communities across Nigeria,
communities whose waterways
have been infested
by an invasive aquatic weed;
communities where economic livelihoods
have been hampered:
fishing, marine transportation
and trading;
communities where fish yields
have diminished;
communities where schoolchildren
are unable to go to school
for days, sometimes weeks, on end.
Who would have thought that this plant
with round leaves, inflated stems,
and showy, lavender flowers
would cause such havoc
in these communities.
The plant is known as water hyacinth
and its botanical name,
Eichhornia crassipes.
Interestingly, in Nigeria,
the plant is also known by other names,
names associated with historical events,
as well as myths.
In some places,
the plant is called Babangida.
When you hear Babangida, you remember
the military and military coups.
And you think: fear, restraint.
In parts of Nigeria in the Niger Delta,
the plant is also known as Abiola.
When you hear Abiola,
you remember annulled elections
and you think: dashed hopes.
In the southwestern part of Nigeria,
the plant is known as Gbe'borun.
Gbe'borun is a Yoruba phrase
which translates to "gossip,"
or "talebearer."
When you think of gossip, you think:
rapid reproduction, destruction.
And in the Igala-speaking part of Nigeria,
the plant is known as A Kp'iye Kp'oma,
And when you hear that,
you think of death.
It literally translates
to "death to mother and child."
I personally had my encounter
with this plant in the year 2009.
It was shortly after I had relocated
from the US to Nigeria.
I'd quit my job in corporate America
and decided to take
this big leap of faith,
a leap of faith that came
out of a deep sense of conviction
that there was a lot of work
to do in Nigeria
in the area of sustainable development.
And so here I was in the year 2009,
actually, at the end of 2009,
in Lagos on the Third Mainland Bridge.
And I looked to my left
and saw this very arresting image.
It was an image of fishing boats
that had been hemmed in
by dense mats of water hyacinth.
And I was really pained by what I saw
because I thought to myself,
"These poor fisherfolk,
how are they going
to go about their daily activities
with these restrictions."
And then I thought,
"There's got to be a better way."
A win-win solution whereby
the environment is taken care of
by the weeds being cleared out of the way
and then this being turned
into an economic benefit
for the communities
whose lives are impacted the most
by the infestation of the weed.
That, I would say, was my spark moment.
And so I did further research
to find out more
about the beneficial uses of this weed.
Out of the several,
one struck me the most.
It was the use of the plant
for handicrafts.
And I thought, "What a great idea."
Personally, I love handicrafts,
especially handicrafts
that are woven around a story.
And so I thought, "This could be
easily deployed within the communities
without the requirement
of technical skills."
And I thought to myself,
"Three simple steps to a mega solution."
First step: Get out into the waterways
and harvest the water hyacinth.
That way, you create access.
Secondly, you dry
the water hyacinth stems.
And thirdly, you weave
the water hyacinth into products.
The third step was a challenge.
See, I'm a computer scientist
by background
and not someone in the creative arts.
And so I began my quest
to find out how I can learn how to weave.
And this quest took me
to a community in Ibadan, where I lived,
called Sabo.
Sabo translates to "strangers' quarters."
And the community is
predominantly made up of people
from the northern part of the country.
So I literally took
my dried weeds in hand,
there were several more of them,
and went knocking from door to door
to find out who could teach me
how to weave these
water hyacinth stems into ropes.
And I was directed
to the shed of Malam Yahaya.
The problem, though,
is that Malam Yahaya doesn't speak English
and neither did I speak Hausa.
But some little kids came to the rescue
and helped translate.
And that began my journey
of learning how to weave
and transform these
dried water hyacinth stems
into long ropes.
With my long ropes in hand,
I was now equipped to make products.
And that was the beginning
of partnerships.
Working with rattan basket makers
to come up with products.
So with this in hand, I felt confident
that I would be able
to take this knowledge
back into the riverine communities
and help them to transform
their adversity into prosperity.
So taking these weeds
and actually weaving them
into products that can be sold.
So we have pens, we have tableware,
we have purses, we have tissue boxes.
Thereby, helping the communities
to see water hyacinth
in a different light.
Seeing water hyacinth as being valuable,
being aesthetic,
being durable, tough, resilient.
Changing names, changing livelihoods.
From Gbe'borun, gossip,
to Olusotan, storyteller.
And from A Kp'iye Kp'oma,
which is "killer of mother and child,"
to Ya du j'ewn w'Iye kp'Oma,
"provider of food for mother and child."
And I'd like to end
with a quote by Michael Margolis.
He said, "If you want to learn
about a culture, listen to the stories.
And if you want to change a culture,
change the stories."
And so, from Makoko community,
to Abobiri, to Ewoi,
to Kolo, to Owahwa, Esaba,
we have changed the story.
Thank you for listening.
(Applause)
A few years ago,
all the developed
countries in the world --
the wealthier ones --
and all of the charities
together donated about 200 billion dollars
to developing countries in the world --
the ones that bear most of the burden,
the heaviest burden
of the world's biggest problems:
poverty, hunger,
climate change and inequality.
That same year,
businesses invested in those same
countries 3.7 trillion dollars.
Now, I get to travel a lot in my work
and I'm privileged
to see the amazing things
that NGOs and some governments are doing
with some of that 200 billion dollars:
helping malnourished children
or families that don't
have access to clean water,
children who wouldn't
be educated otherwise.
But it's not enough
because the biggest problems
in our world need trillions
not just billions.
So if we're going to make
lasting and significant progress
in the big challenges in our world,
we need business,
both the companies and the investors,
to drive the solutions.
So let's talk about
what business should do.
And when I say that,
you probably think that I'm going
to talk about corporate philanthropy
or corporate social responsibility.
CSR is the norm today,
and it's very useful.
It provides a route
for corporate generosity
and that generosity is important
to many corporations' employees
and customers.
But you know what?
It's just not big enough,
or strong enough,
or durable enough
to drive solutions to the biggest
problems in our world today
because it's incremental cost.
Even when business is booming,
CSR just isn't designed to scale.
And then of course in a downturn,
it's one of the first programs to be cut.
So no,
CSR --
corporate social responsibility --
isn't the answer,
but TSI --
total societal impact, is.
TSI is the sum of all of the ways
business can affect society
by doing the real work:
thinking about their supply chains,
working on their product design
and manufacturing processes
and their distribution.
The real work of business,
when done with innovation,
can actually create
core business benefits for the company
and it can solve the meaningful
problems in our world today.
So what does TSI look like?
Focusing on TSI
means incorporating
social and environmental considerations.
And you know what?
It's something that isn't completely new.
It's been thought about for a while.
But the hard part is that corporations
almost exclusively still think
about something called TSR:
total shareholder returns.
But TSI --
total societal impact --
needs to stand alongside TSR
as an important and valid driver
of corporate strategy
and corporate decision-making.
And we've got the data
to show you why and how.
Some companies
are already making this happen.
They're beginning to make it happen.
So let me tell you the story about Mars.
Mars is the sixth-largest private company
in the United States.
If you're like me,
they make some important products,
like coffee and chocolate.
So not surprisingly,
one of their most important
ingredients is cocoa.
And some of their competitors
are actually really worried
about the sustainability
and the availability of cocoa supplies.
But not Mars.
They're confident in the stable supply
of that crop for the long term.
And why is that?
It's because they partner
with NGOs around the world
that are working
with small shareholder farmers.
And those certification agency's NGOs
are working to help farmers
improve crop yields,
they're making sure that they get
a fair, premium, livable wage
and they're helping them address
any human rights potential issues
in supply chains,
and they're helping minimize
the effects on the environment,
like deforestation.
Mars is on a path
to 100 percent certified cocoa,
so this is a good program
for farming communities,
it's a good program for the environment,
and it's a good program for Mars,
who has solved a significant risk
in their supply chain.
But now let's get to the data,
because it's actually really awesome.
And let me explain exactly what the data
points I'm going to talk about are.
When analysts and financial people
look at companies,
they think about
a lot of different statistics.
I want to talk about
two of the most important ones.
I'm going to talk about
the overall value of a company --
its valuation --
and I'm going to talk about its margin.
Basically the difference
between all of its earnings
and all of its costs.
So in our study,
we looked at oil and gas companies,
and the oil and gas companies
that are performing
most strongly on TSI --
total societal impact --
see a 19 percent premium
on their valuation.
19 percent.
When they do really well
on things like minimizing
the impact of their company
on the environment and water,
and when they have very strong
occupational health and safety programs.
And when they also add in
strong employee training programs,
they get a 3.4 percentage point
premium on their margins.
But what about other industries?
Biopharmaceutical companies
that are the strongest performers on TSI
see a 12 percent premium
on their valuation.
And then if they're best
at expanded access to medicines --
making medicines available
for the people who need them --
they see a 6.7 percentage point premium
on their gross margins.
For the retail banks
that are strongest on TSI,
they see a three percentage point
premium on their valuation,
and then for those that differentially
provide financial inclusion --
access to financial products
for people who need it --
they see a 0.5 percentage point premium
in their net income margin.
Now, these numbers for banks
may not seem very big,
but in highly competitive industries,
even really small differences
in margin matter a lot.
Now, what about those
consumer goods companies --
the ones who make those products we love
like coffee and chocolate?
Consumer goods companies
that perform best on total societal impact
see an 11 percent valuation premium.
And then if they do those smart
things with their supply chain --
inclusive and responsibly
sourcing their product --
they see a 4.8 percentage point premium
on their gross margins.
These numbers are significant.
We've long known that things
like fundamental financials,
growth rates and financial risks
are key drivers of valuation,
but this rigorous analysis shows
that social and environmental factors --
total societal impact measures --
are also linked to valuations and margins.
Wow.
All else equal --
we didn't confuse
the analysis with anything.
All else being equal,
companies that perform strongly
on social and environmental areas
achieve higher margins
and higher valuations.
Now, I do understand
that companies are under
a lot of short-term earnings pressures.
But fortunately,
the investors who create
some of this pressure
are actually more and more themselves
starting to think longer-term
and starting to think with this TSI lens.
In our conversations
and surveys with investors,
75 percent of them say
they expect to see improved revenues
and improved operating efficiency
for companies that are thinking
with a TSI lens.
And they're actually starting
to incorporate this
in their own investing behavior.
Last year,
23 trillion in global assets
were in the category
of socially responsible investing.
Now, that's five billion
over just the last two years.
And it represents a quarter of the total
global assets managed in the world.
I know that some of you
may be cringing a little bit right now.
Because in my decades
of strategy consulting
with businesses and NGOs
and governments around the world,
I find that many businesspeople
are hesitant to talk
or even sometimes think about
the business benefits of doing good.
They somehow think
it's going to negate the value
of the benefits
they're creating for society.
Or that they'll be perceived
as heartless or even mercenary.
But we really do need
to think differently.
We need to think differently
because the only way
we're going to make substantial progress
on the challenging problems of our time
is for business to drive the solutions.
The job of business
is to meet customer needs
and to do so profitably.
They need to to survive.
So one of the best ways for businesses
to help ensure their own growth,
their own longevity,
is to meet some of the hardest
challenges in our society
and to do so profitably.
And when they do that innovatively,
when they do that ethically,
responsibly, incredibly,
they should be proud.
But if you still aren't sure about this,
let's talk about a few more examples.
What if you're a technology company
and you're trying to grow your platform
and you're trying to grow your customers?
Like, Airbnb.
Airbnb has a portfolio
of total societal impact activities.
They're all spot-on their core business.
In one initiative,
they're helping enable their community
to provide housing for free
to those in disaster:
crisis survivors and relief workers.
In another effort on their part,
they're actually helping
and working with NGOs
to ensure that people can provide
housing for free for refugees.
Now, what I love about this program
is that I don't think
most people would've figured out
how to express their generosity
and open their homes
for those in such dire need --
certainly not so quickly
or so easily or efficiently --
without this innovation by Airbnb.
But at the same time,
this is core to their corporate strategy
and core to their growth
because they grow by increasing
the number of hosts and guests
using their platform.
But if they'd only
been thinking exclusively
about the return side of things,
I'm not sure they would have ever
figured out this route to growth,
because they're not
charging transaction fees.
So it's a pretty exciting way,
when they were thinking
about how to bring their capabilities
to a need in society
and at the same time
drive their own growth.
But what if you're trying to find
new customer segments?
Let's move to South Africa,
and let's talk about Standard Bank.
In South Africa,
the government has a regulation
that requires all banks
to donate 0.2 percent of their profits
to small and medium
black-owned enterprises.
And many banks just donate
this to the entrepreneurs,
but Standard Bank thought creatively.
And what they did is they took those funds
and they invested them
in an independent trust,
and they used that trust to fund loans
to these black entrepreneurs.
This is a highly leveraged model.
They can support a lot more
entrepreneurs with capital,
and because their success
is completely intertwined
with the success of the entrepreneurs,
they're actually also using the fund
to provide technical assistance.
More entrepreneurs supported,
more people and communities
being lifted out of poverty.
And it's successful for Standard Bank.
So successful that they're actually
working on expanding this program
to other areas in their portfolio.
It's not like we haven't been trying
to solve the problems in our world
for a long time.
We have, and they're still here.
We're making progress,
but it's not far enough,
or fast enough,
or universal enough.
We need to flip our thinking.
We need to have business --
both companies and investors --
bring creative, innovative
corporate strategy and capital
to solving the biggest
problems in our world.
And when they do that innovatively,
and when they do that
with all of their thinking
and all of their strategy
and all of their capital,
and they're creating
both total shareholder returns
and total societal impact,
we know that we will solve those problems,
both profitably and generously.
Thank you.
(Applause)
I'm a neuroscientist,
and I'm the co-founder of Backyard Brains,
and our mission is to train
the next generation of neuroscientists
by taking graduate-level
neuroscience research equipment
and making it available for kids
in middle schools and high schools.
And so when we go into the classroom,
one way to get them thinking
about the brain, which is very complex,
is to ask them a very simple
question about neuroscience,
and that is, "What has a brain?"
When we ask that,
students will instantly tell you
that their cat or dog has a brain,
and most will say that a mouse
or even a small insect has a brain,
but almost nobody says
that a plant or a tree
or a shrub has a brain.
And so when you push --
because this could actually
help describe a little bit
how the brain actually functions --
so you push and say,
"Well, what is it that makes
living things have brains versus not?"
And often they'll come back
with the classification
that things that move tend to have brains.
And that's absolutely correct.
Our nervous system evolved
because it is electrical.
It's fast, so we can quickly respond
to stimuli in the world
and move if we need to.
But you can go back
and push back on a student,
and say, "Well, you know,
you say that plants don't have brains,
but plants do move."
Anyone who has grown a plant
has noticed that the plant will move
and face the sun.
But they'll say,
"But that's a slow movement.
You know, that doesn't count.
That could be a chemical process."
But what about fast-moving plants?
Now, in 1760, Arthur Dobbs,
the Royal Governor of North Carolina,
made a pretty fascinating discovery.
In the swamps behind his house,
he found a plant that would spring shut
every time a bug would fall in between it.
He called this plant the flytrap,
and within a decade,
it made its way over to Europe,
where eventually the great Charles Darwin
got to study this plant,
and this plant absolutely blew him away.
He called it the most wonderful
plant in the world.
This is a plant
that was an evolutionary wonder.
This is a plant that moves quickly,
which is rare,
and it's carnivorous, which is also rare.
And this is in the same plant.
But I'm here today to tell you
that's not even the coolest thing
about this plant.
The coolest thing
is that the plant can count.
So in order to show that,
we have to get some vocabulary
out of the way.
So I'm going to do what we do
in the classroom with students.
We're going to do
an experiment on electrophysiology,
which is the recording
of the body's electrical signal,
either coming from neurons
or from muscles.
And I'm putting some electrodes
here on my wrists.
As I hook them up,
we're going to be able to see a signal
on the screen here.
And this signal may be familiar to you.
It's called the EKG,
or the electrocardiogram.
And this is coming
from neurons in my heart
that are firing
what's called action potentials,
potential meaning voltage and action
meaning it moves quickly up and down,
which causes my heart to fire,
which then causes
the signal that you see here.
And so I want you to remember the shape
of what we'll be looking at right here,
because this is going to be important.
This is a way that the brain
encodes information
in the form of an action potential.
So now let's turn to some plants.
So I'm going to first
introduce you to the mimosa,
not the drink, but the Mimosa pudica,
and this is a plant that's found
in Central America and South America,
and it has behaviors.
And the first behavior
I'm going to show you
is if I touch the leaves here,
you get to see that the leaves
tend to curl up.
And then the second behavior is,
if I tap the leaf,
the entire branch seems to fall down.
So why does it do that?
It's not really known to science.
One of the reasons why
could be that it scares away insects
or it looks less appealing to herbivores.
But how does it do that?
Now, that's interesting.
We can do an experiment to find out.
So what we're going to do now,
just like I recorded
the electrical potential from my body,
we're going to record the electrical
potential from this plant, this mimosa.
And so what we're going to do
is I've got a wire wrapped around the stem,
and I've got the ground electrode where?
In the ground. It's an electrical
engineering joke. Alright.
(Laughter)
Alright. So I'm going to go ahead
and tap the leaf here,
and I want you to look
at the electrical recording
that we're going to see inside the plant.
Whoa. It is so big,
I've got to scale it down.
Alright. So what is that?
That is an action potential
that is happening inside the plant.
Why was it happening?
Because it wanted to move. Right?
And so when I hit the touch receptors,
it sent a voltage all the way down
to the end of the stem,
which caused it to move.
And now, in our arms,
we would move our muscles,
but the plant doesn't have muscles.
What it has is water inside the cells
and when the voltage hits it,
it opens up, releases the water,
changes the shape of the cells,
and the leaf falls.
OK. So here we see an action potential
encoding information to move. Alright?
But can it do more?
So let's go to find out.
We're going to go to our good friend,
the Venus flytrap here,
and we're going to take a look
at what happens inside the leaf
when a fly lands on here.
So I'm going to pretend
to be a fly right now.
And now here's my Venus flytrap,
and inside the leaf,
you're going to notice
that there are three little hairs here,
and those are trigger hairs.
And so when a fly lands --
I'm going to touch
one of the hairs right now.
Ready? One, two, three.
What do we get? We get
a beautiful action potential.
However, the flytrap doesn't close.
And to understand why that is,
we need to know a little bit more
about the behavior of the flytrap.
Number one is that it takes
a long time to open the traps back up --
you know, about 24 to 48 hours
if there's no fly inside of it.
And so it takes a lot of energy.
And two, it doesn't need to eat
that many flies throughout the year.
Only a handful. It gets
most of its energy from the sun.
It's just trying to replace
some nutrients in the ground with flies.
And the third thing is,
it only opens then closes the traps
a handful of times
until that trap dies.
So therefore, it wants
to make really darn sure
that there's a meal inside of it
before the flytrap snaps shut.
So how does it do that?
It counts the number of seconds
between successive
touching of those hairs.
And so the idea is
that there's a high probability,
if there's a fly inside of there,
they're going to be quick together,
and so when it gets the first
action potential,
it starts counting, one, two,
and if it gets to 20
and it doesn't fire again,
then it's not going to close,
but if it does it within there,
then the flytrap will close.
So we're going to go back now.
I'm going to touch
the Venus flytrap again.
I've been talking
for more than 20 seconds.
So we can see what happens
when I touch the hair a second time.
So what do we get?
We get a second action potential,
but again, the leaf doesn't close.
So now if I go back in there
and if I'm a fly moving around,
I'm going to be touching
the leaf a few times.
I'm going to go and brush it a few times.
And immediately,
the flytrap closes.
So here we are seeing the flytrap
actually doing a computation.
It's determining
if there's a fly inside the trap,
and then it closes.
So let's go back to our original question.
Do plants have brains?
Well, the answer is no.
There's no brains in here.
There's no axons, no neurons.
It doesn't get depressed.
It doesn't want to know
what the Tigers' score is.
It doesn't have
self-actualization problems.
But what it does have
is something that's very similar to us,
which is the ability
to communicate using electricity.
It just uses slightly
different ions than we do,
but it's actually doing the same thing.
So just to show you
the ubiquitous nature
of these action potentials,
we saw it in the Venus flytrap,
we've seen an action
potential in the mimosa.
We've even seen
an action potential in a human.
Now, this is the euro of the brain.
It's the way that all
information is passed.
And so what we can do
is we can use those action potentials
to pass information
between species of plants.
And so this is our interspecies
plant-to-plant communicator,
and what we've done
is we've created a brand new experiment
where we're going to record
the action potential from a Venus flytrap,
and we're going to send it
into the sensitive mimosa.
So I want you to recall what happens
when we touch the leaves of the mimosa.
It has touch receptors
that are sending that information
back down in the form
of an action potential.
And so what would happen
if we took the action potential
from the Venus flytrap
and sent it into
all the stems of the mimosa?
We should be able to create
the behavior of the mimosas
without actually touching it ourselves.
And so if you'll allow me,
I'm going to go ahead
and trigger this mimosa right now
by touching on the hairs
of the Venus flytrap.
So we're going to send information
about touch from one plant to another.
So there you see it.
So --
(Applause)
So I hope you learned a little bit,
something about plants today,
and not only that.
You learned that plants could be used
to help teach neuroscience
and bring along the neurorevolution.
Thank you.
(Applause)
I'm here to talk to you about how globalized we are,
how globalized we aren't,
and why it's important to actually be accurate
in making those kinds of assessments.
And the leading point of view on this, whether measured
by number of books sold, mentions in media,
or surveys that I've run with groups ranging from
my students to delegates to the World Trade Organization,
is this view that national borders
really don't matter very much anymore,
cross-border integration is close to complete,
and we live in one world.
And what's interesting about this view
is, again, it's a view that's held by pro-globalizers
like Tom Friedman, from whose book this quote is obviously excerpted,
but it's also held by anti-globalizers, who see this giant
globalization tsunami that's about to wreck all our lives
if it hasn't already done so.
The other thing I would add is that this is not a new view.
I'm a little bit of an amateur historian, so I've spent
some time going back, trying to see the first mention
of this kind of thing. And the best, earliest quote
that I could find was one from David Livingstone,
writing in the 1850s about how the railroad, the steam ship,
and the telegraph were integrating East Africa perfectly
with the rest of the world.
Now clearly, David Livingstone
was a little bit ahead of his time,
but it does seem useful to ask ourselves,
"Just how global are we?"
before we think about where we go from here.
So the best way I've found of trying to get people
to take seriously the idea that the world may not be flat,
may not even be close to flat, is with some data.
So one of the things I've been doing over the last few years
is really compiling data on things that could either happen
within national borders or across national borders,
and I've looked at the cross-border component
as a percentage of the total.
I'm not going to present all the data that I have here today,
but let me just give you a few data points.
I'm going to talk a little bit about one kind of information flow,
one kind of flow of people, one kind of flow of capital,
and, of course, trade in products and services.
So let's start off with plain old telephone service.
Of all the voice-calling minutes in the world last year,
what percentage do you think were accounted for
by cross-border phone calls?
Pick a percentage in your own mind.
The answer turns out to be two percent.
If you include Internet telephony, you might be able
to push this number up to six or seven percent,
but it's nowhere near what people tend to estimate.
Or let's turn to people moving across borders.
One particular thing we might look at, in terms of
long-term flows of people, is what percentage
of the world's population is accounted for
by first-generation immigrants?
Again, please pick a percentage.
Turns out to be a little bit higher.
It's actually about three percent.
Or think of investment. Take all the real investment
that went on in the world in 2010.
What percentage of that was accounted for
by foreign direct investment?
Not quite ten percent.
And then finally, the one statistic
that I suspect many of the people in this room have seen:
the export-to-GDP ratio.
If you look at the official statistics, they typically indicate
a little bit above 30 percent.
However, there's a big problem with the official statistics,
in that if, for instance, a Japanese component supplier
ships something to China to be put into an iPod,
and then the iPod gets shipped to the U.S.,
that component ends up getting counted multiple times.
So nobody knows how bad this bias
with the official statistics actually is, so I thought I would
ask the person who's spearheading the effort
to generate data on this, Pascal Lamy,
the Director of the World Trade Organization,
what his best guess would be
of exports as a percentage of GDP,
without the double- and triple-counting,
and it's actually probably a bit under 20 percent, rather than
the 30 percent-plus numbers that we're talking about.
So it's very clear that if you look at these numbers
or all the other numbers that I talk about in my book,
"World 3.0," that we're very, very far from
the no-border effect benchmark, which would imply
internationalization levels of the order of 85, 90, 95 percent.
So clearly, apocalyptically-minded authors
have overstated the case.
But it's not just the apocalyptics, as I think of them,
who are prone to this kind of overstatement.
I've also spent some time surveying audiences
in different parts of the world
on what they actually guess these numbers to be.
Let me share with you the results of a survey
that Harvard Business Review was kind enough to run
of its readership as to what people's guesses
along these dimensions actually were.
So a couple of observations stand out for me from this slide.
First of all, there is a suggestion of some error.
Okay. (Laughter)
Second, these are pretty large errors. For four quantities
whose average value is less than 10 percent,
you have people guessing three, four times that level.
Even though I'm an economist, I find that
a pretty large error.
And third, this is not just confined to the readers
of the Harvard Business Review.
I've run several dozen such surveys in different parts
of the world, and in all cases except one,
where a group actually underestimated
the trade-to-GDP ratio, people have this tendency
towards overestimation, and so I thought it important
to give a name to this, and that's what I refer to
as globaloney, the difference between the dark blue bars
and the light gray bars.
Especially because, I suspect, some of you may still be
a little bit skeptical of the claims, I think it's important
to just spend a little bit of time thinking about
why we might be prone to globaloney.
A couple of different reasons come to mind.
First of all, there's a real dearth of data in the debate.
Let me give you an example. When I first published
some of these data a few years ago
in a magazine called Foreign Policy,
one of the people who wrote in, not entirely in agreement,
was Tom Friedman. And since my article was titled
"Why the World Isn't Flat," that wasn't too surprising. (Laughter)
What was very surprising to me was Tom's critique,
which was, "Ghemawat's data are narrow."
And this caused me to scratch my head, because
as I went back through his several-hundred-page book,
I couldn't find a single figure, chart, table,
reference or footnote.
So my point is, I haven't presented a lot of data here
to convince you that I'm right, but I would urge you
to go away and look for your own data
to try and actually assess whether some of these
hand-me-down insights that we've been bombarded with
actually are correct.
So dearth of data in the debate is one reason.
A second reason has to do with peer pressure.
I remember, I decided to write my
"Why the World Isn't Flat" article, because
I was being interviewed on TV in Mumbai,
and the interviewer's first question to me was,
"Professor Ghemawat, why do you still believe
that the world is round?" And I started laughing,
because I hadn't come across that formulation before. (Laughter)
And as I was laughing, I was thinking,
I really need a more coherent response, especially
on national TV. I'd better write something about this. (Laughter)
But what I can't quite capture for you
was the pity and disbelief
with which the interviewer asked her question.
The perspective was, here is this poor professor.
He's clearly been in a cave for the last 20,000 years.
He really has no idea
as to what's actually going on in the world.
So try this out with your friends and acquaintances,
if you like. You'll find that it's very cool
to talk about the world being one, etc.
If you raise questions about that formulation,
you really are considered a bit of an antique.
And then the final reason, which I mention,
especially to a TED audience, with some trepidation,
has to do with what I call "techno-trances."
If you listen to techno music for long periods of time,
it does things to your brainwave activity. (Laughter)
Something similar seems to happen
with exaggerated conceptions of how technology
is going to overpower in the very immediate run
all cultural barriers, all political barriers,
all geographic barriers, because at this point
I know you aren't allowed to ask me questions,
but when I get to this point in my lecture with my students,
hands go up, and people ask me,
"Yeah, but what about Facebook?"
And I got this question often enough that I thought
I'd better do some research on Facebook.
Because, in some sense, it's the ideal kind of technology
to think about. Theoretically, it makes it
as easy to form friendships halfway around the world
as opposed to right next door.
What percentage of people's friends on Facebook
are actually located in countries other than where
people we're analyzing are based?
The answer is probably somewhere between
10 to 15 percent.
Non-negligible, so we don't live in an entirely local
or national world, but very, very far from the 95 percent level
that you would expect, and the reason's very simple.
We don't, or I hope we don't, form friendships at random
on Facebook. The technology is overlaid
on a pre-existing matrix of relationships that we have,
and those relationships are what the technology
doesn't quite displace. Those relationships are why
we get far fewer than 95 percent of our friends
being located in countries other than where we are.
So does all this matter? Or is globaloney
just a harmless way of getting people to pay more attention
to globalization-related issues?
I want to suggest that actually,
globaloney can be very harmful to your health.
First of all, recognizing that the glass
is only 10 to 20 percent full is critical to seeing
that there might be potential for additional gains
from additional integration,
whereas if we thought we were already there,
there would be no particular point to pushing harder.
It's a little bit like, we wouldn't be having a conference
on radical openness if we already thought we were totally open
to all the kinds of influences that are being talked about
at this conference.
So being accurate about how limited globalization levels are
is critical to even being able to notice
that there might be room for something more,
something that would contribute further to global welfare.
Which brings me to my second point.
Avoiding overstatement is also very helpful
because it reduces and in some cases even reverses
some of the fears that people have about globalization.
So I actually spend most of my "World 3.0" book
working through a litany of market failures and fears
that people have that they worry globalization is going to exacerbate.
I'm obviously not going to be able to do that for you today,
so let me just present to you two headlines
as an illustration of what I have in mind.
Think of France and the current debate about immigration.
When you ask people in France what percentage
of the French population is immigrants,
the answer is about 24 percent. That's their guess.
Maybe realizing that the number is just eight percent
might help cool some of the superheated rhetoric
that we see around the immigration issue.
Or to take an even more striking example,
when the Chicago Council on Foreign Relations
did a survey of Americans, asking them to guess
what percentage of the federal budget went to foreign aid,
the guess was 30 percent, which is
slightly in excess of the actual level — ("actually about ... 1%") (Laughter) —
of U.S. governmental commitments to federal aid.
The reassuring thing about this particular survey was,
when it was pointed out to people how far
their estimates were from the actual data,
some of them — not all of them — seemed to become
more willing to consider increases in foreign aid.
So foreign aid is actually a great way
of sort of wrapping up here, because
if you think about it, what I've been talking about today
is this notion -- very uncontroversial amongst economists --
that most things are very home-biased.
"Foreign aid is the most aid to poor people,"
is about the most home-biased thing you can find.
If you look at the OECD countries and how much
they spend per domestic poor person,
and compare it with how much they spend
per poor person in poor countries,
the ratio — Branko Milanovic at the World Bank did the calculations —
turns out to be about 30,000 to one.
Now of course, some of us, if we truly are cosmopolitan,
would like to see that ratio being brought down
to one-is-to-one.
I'd like to make the suggestion that we don't need to aim
for that to make substantial progress from where we are.
If we simply brought that ratio down to 15,000 to one,
we would be meeting those aid targets that were agreed
at the Rio Summit 20 years ago that the summit
that ended last week made no further progress on.
So in summary, while radical openness is great,
given how closed we are,
even incremental openness could make things
dramatically better. Thank you very much. (Applause)
(Applause)
So my name is Taylor Wilson.
I am 17 years old
and I am a nuclear physicist,
which may be a little hard to believe, but I am.
And I would like to make the case
that nuclear fusion
will be that point,
that the bridge that T. Boone Pickens talked about
will get us to.
So nuclear fusion is our energy future.
And the second point,
making the case that kids can really change the world.
So you may ask --
(Applause)
You may ask me,
well how do you know what our energy future is?
Well I built a fusion reactor
when I was 14 years old.
That is the inside of my nuclear fusion reactor.
I started building this project
when I was about 12 or 13 years old.
I decided I wanted to make a star.
Now most of you are probably saying,
well there's no such thing as nuclear fusion.
I don't see any nuclear power plants with fusion energy.
Well it doesn't break even.
It doesn't produce more energy out than I put in,
but it still does some pretty cool stuff.
And I assembled this in my garage,
and it now lives in the physics department
of the University of Nevada, Reno.
And it slams together deuterium,
which is just hydrogen with an extra neutron in it.
So this is similar to the reaction
of the proton chain that's going on inside the Sun.
And I'm slamming it together so hard
that that hydrogen fuses together,
and in the process it has some byproducts,
and I utilize those byproducts.
So this previous year,
I won the Intel International Science and Engineering Fair.
I developed a detector that replaces the current detectors
that Homeland Security has.
For hundreds of dollars,
I've developed a system that exceeds the sensitivity
of detectors that are hundreds of thousands of dollars.
I built this in my garage.
(Applause)
And I've developed a system
to produce medical isotopes.
Instead of requiring multi-million-dollar facilities
I've developed a device that, on a very small scale,
can produce these isotopes.
So that's my fusion reactor in the background there.
That is me at the control panel
of my fusion reactor.
Oh, by the way, I make yellowcake in my garage,
so my nuclear program is as advanced as the Iranians.
So maybe I don't want to admit to that.
This is me at CERN in Geneva, Switzerland,
which is the preeminent particle physics laboratory in the world.
And this is me with President Obama,
showing him my Homeland Security research.
(Applause)
So in about seven years
of doing nuclear research,
I started out with a dream
to make a "star in a jar," a star in my garage,
and I ended up meeting the president
and developing things that I think can change the world,
and I think other kids can too.
So thank you very much.
(Applause)
So magic is a very introverted field.
While scientists regularly publish their latest research,
we magicians do not like to share our methods and secrets.
That's true even amongst peers.
But if you look at creative practice as a form of research,
or art as a form of R&amp;D for humanity,
then how could a cyber illusionist like myself
share his research?
Now my own speciality is combining digital technology and magic.
And about three years ago,
I started an exercise
in openness and inclusiveness
by reaching out into the open-source software community
to create new digital tools for magic --
tools that could eventually be shared with other artists
to start them off further on in the process
and to get them to the poetry faster.
Today, I'd like to show you something which came out of these collaborations.
It's an augmented reality
projection tracking and mapping system,
or a digital storytelling tool.
Could we bring down the lights please? Thank you.
So let's give this a try.
And I'm going to use it
to give you my take
on the stuff of life.
(Applause)
(Music)
Terribly sorry. I forgot the floor.
Wake up.
Hey.
Come on.
(Music)
Please.
(Music)
Come on.
Ah, sorry about that.
Forgot this.
(Music)
Give it another try.
Okay.
He figured out the system.
(Music)
(Laughter)
(Applause)
(Music)
Uh oh.
(Music)
All right. Let's try this.
Come on.
(Music)
(Laughter)
(Music)
Hey.
(Music)
You heard her, go ahead.
(Laughter)
(Applause)
Bye-bye.
(Applause)
A human child is born,
and for quite a long time
is a consumer.
It cannot be consciously a contributor.
It is helpless.
It doesn't know how to survive,
even though it is endowed with an instinct to survive.
It needs the help of mother, or a foster mother, to survive.
It can't afford to doubt the person who tends the child.
It has to totally surrender,
as one surrenders to an anesthesiologist.
It has to totally surrender.
That implies a lot of trust.
That implies the trusted person
won't violate the trust.
As the child grows,
it begins to discover
that the person trusted is violating the trust.
It doesn't know even the word "violation."
Therefore, it has to blame itself,
a wordless blame,
which is more difficult to really resolve --
the wordless self-blame.
As the child grows to become an adult:
so far, it has been a consumer,
but the growth of a human being
lies in his or her capacity to contribute,
to be a contributor.
One cannot contribute unless one feels secure,
one feels big,
one feels: I have enough.
To be compassionate is not a joke.
It's not that simple.
One has to discover a certain bigness in oneself.
That bigness should be centered on oneself,
not in terms of money,
not in terms of power you wield,
not in terms of any status that you can command in the society,
but it should be centered on oneself.
The self: you are self-aware.
On that self, it should be centered -- a bigness, a wholeness.
Otherwise, compassion is just a word and a dream.
You can be compassionate occasionally,
more moved by empathy
than by compassion.
Thank God we are empathetic.
When somebody's in pain, we pick up the pain.
In a Wimbledon final match,
these two guys fight it out.
Each one has got two games.
It can be anybody's game.
What they have sweated so far has no meaning.
One person wins.
The tennis etiquette is, both the players have to come to the net
and shake hands.
The winner boxes the air
and kisses the ground,
throws his shirt as though somebody is waiting for it.
(Laughter)
And this guy has to come to the net.
When he comes to the net,
you see, his whole face changes.
It looks as though he's wishing that he didn't win.
Why? Empathy.
That's human heart.
No human heart is denied of that empathy.
No religion can demolish that by indoctrination.
No culture, no nation and nationalism --
nothing can touch it
because it is empathy.
And that capacity to empathize
is the window through which you reach out to people,
you do something that makes a difference in somebody's life --
even words, even time.
Compassion is not defined in one form.
There's no Indian compassion.
There's no American compassion.
It transcends nation, the gender, the age.
Why? Because it is there in everybody.
It's experienced by people occasionally.
Then this occasional compassion,
we are not talking about --
it will never remain occasional.
By mandate, you cannot make a person compassionate.
You can't say, "Please love me."
Love is something you discover.
It's not an action,
but in the English language, it is also an action.
I will come to it later.
So one has got to discover a certain wholeness.
I am going to cite the possibility of being whole,
which is within our experience, everybody's experience.
In spite of a very tragic life,
one is happy in moments which are very few and far between.
And the one who is happy,
even for a slapstick joke,
accepts himself and also the scheme of things in which one finds oneself.
That means the whole universe,
known things and unknown things.
All of them are totally accepted
because you discover your wholeness in yourself.
The subject -- "me" --
and the object -- the scheme of things --
fuse into oneness,
an experience nobody can say, "I am denied of,"
an experience common to all and sundry.
That experience confirms that, in spite of all your limitations --
all your wants, desires, unfulfilled, and the credit cards
and layoffs
and, finally, baldness --
you can be happy.
But the extension of the logic is
that you don't need to fulfill your desire to be happy.
You are the very happiness, the wholeness that you want to be.
There's no choice in this:
that only confirms the reality
that the wholeness cannot be different from you,
cannot be minus you.
It has got to be you.
You cannot be a part of wholeness
and still be whole.
Your moment of happiness reveals that reality,
that realization, that recognition:
"Maybe I am the whole.
Maybe the swami is right.
Maybe the swami is right." You start your new life.
Then everything becomes meaningful.
I have no more reason to blame myself.
If one has to blame oneself, one has a million reasons plus many.
But if I say, in spite of my body being limited --
if it is black it is not white, if it is white it is not black:
body is limited any which way you look at it. Limited.
Your knowledge is limited, health is limited,
and power is therefore limited,
and the cheerfulness is going to be limited.
Compassion is going to be limited.
Everything is going to be limitless.
You cannot command compassion
unless you become limitless, and nobody can become limitless,
either you are or you are not. Period.
And there is no way of your being not limitless too.
Your own experience reveals, in spite of all limitations, you are the whole.
And the wholeness is the reality of you
when you relate to the world.
It is love first.
When you relate to the world,
the dynamic manifestation of the wholeness
is, what we say, love.
And itself becomes compassion
if the object that you relate to evokes that emotion.
Then that again transforms into giving, into sharing.
You express yourself because you have compassion.
To discover compassion, you need to be compassionate.
To discover the capacity to give and share,
you need to be giving and sharing.
There is no shortcut: it is like swimming by swimming.
You learn swimming by swimming.
You cannot learn swimming on a foam mattress and enter into water.
(Laughter)
You learn swimming by swimming. You learn cycling by cycling.
You learn cooking by cooking,
having some sympathetic people around you
to eat what you cook.
(Laughter)
And, therefore, what I say,
you have to fake it and make it.
(Laughter)
You need to.
My predecessor meant that.
You have to act it out.
You have to act compassionately.
There is no verb for compassion,
but you have an adverb for compassion.
That's interesting to me.
You act compassionately.
But then, how to act compassionately if you don't have compassion?
That is where you fake.
You fake it and make it. This is the mantra of the United States of America.
(Laughter)
You fake it and make it.
You act compassionately as though you have compassion:
grind your teeth,
take all the support system.
If you know how to pray, pray.
Ask for compassion.
Let me act compassionately.
Do it.
You'll discover compassion
and also slowly a relative compassion,
and slowly, perhaps if you get the right teaching,
you'll discover compassion is a dynamic manifestation
of the reality of yourself, which is oneness, wholeness,
and that's what you are.
With these words, thank you very much.
(Applause)
Today I'm going to talk
about unexpected discoveries.
Now I work in the solar technology industry.
And my small startup
is looking to force ourselves
into the environment
by paying attention to ...
... paying attention to crowd-sourcing.
It's just a quick video
of what we do.
Huh. Hang on a moment.
It might take a moment to load.
(Laughter)
We'll just -- we can just skip --
I'll just skip through the video instead ...
(Laughter)
No.
(Laughter)
(Laughter)
(Music)
This is not ...
(Laughter)
Okay.
(Laughter)
Solar technology is ...
Oh, that's all my time?
Okay. Thank you very much.
(Applause)
My topic
is economic growth in China and India.
And the question I want to explore with you
is whether or not
democracy has helped or has hindered
economic growth.
You may say this is not fair,
because I'm selecting two countries
to make a case against democracy.
Actually, exactly the opposite
is what I'm going to do.
I'm going to use these two countries
to make an economic argument for democracy,
rather than against democracy.
The first question there
is why China has grown so much faster
than India.
Over the last 30 years,
in terms of the GDP growth rates,
China has grown at twice the rate of India.
In the last five years,
the two countries have begun to converge somewhat
in economic growth.
But over the last 30 years,
China undoubtedly
has done much better than India.
One simple answer
is China has Shanghai and India has Mumbai.
Look at the skyline of Shanghai.
This is the Pudong area.
The picture on India
is the Dharavi slum of Mumbai
in India.
The idea there
behind these two pictures
is that the Chinese government
can act above rule of law.
It can plan
for the long-term benefits of the country
and in the process,
evict millions of people --
that's just a small technical issue.
Whereas in India, you cannot do that,
because you have to listen to the public.
You're being constrained by the public's opinion.
Even Prime Minister Manmohan Singh
agrees with that view.
In an interview
printed in the financial press of India,
He said that he wants to make Mumbai
another Shanghai.
This is an Oxford-trained economist
steeped in humanistic values,
and yet he agrees
with the high-pressure tactics of Shanghai.
So let me call it the Shanghai model of economic growth,
that emphasizes the following features
for promoting economic development:
infrastructures, airports,
highways, bridges, things like that.
And you need a strong government to do that,
because you cannot respect private property rights.
You cannot be constrained by the public's opinion.
You need also state ownership,
especially of land assets,
in order to build and roll out infrastructures
very quickly.
The implication of that model
is that democracy
is a hindrance for economic growth,
rather than a facilitator of economic growth.
Here's the key question.
Just how important are infrastructures
for economic growth?
This is a key issue.
If you believe that infrastructures are very important for economic growth,
then you would argue a strong government is necessary
to promote growth.
If you believe
that infrastructures are not as important as many people believe,
then you will put less emphasis
on strong government.
So to illustrate that question,
let me give you two countries.
And for the sake of brevity,
I'll call one country Country 1
and the other country Country 2.
Country 1
has a systematic advantage over Country 2
in infrastructures.
Country 1 has more telephones,
and Country 1 has a longer system of railways.
So if I were to ask you,
"Which is China
and which is India,
and which country has grown faster?"
if you believe in the infrastructure view,
then you will say, "Country 1 must be China.
They must have done better, in terms of economic growth.
And Country 2 is possibly India."
Actually the country with more telephones
is the Soviet Union,
and the data referred to 1989.
After the country reported very impressive statistics on telephones,
the country collapsed.
That's not too good.
The picture there is Khrushchev.
I know that in 1989
he no longer ruled the Soviet Union,
but that's the best picture that I can find.
(Laughter)
Telephones, infrastructures
do not guarantee you economic growth.
Country 2, that has fewer telephones,
is China.
Since 1989,
the country has performed at a double-digit rate
every year for the last 20 years.
If you know nothing about China and the Soviet Union
other than the fact about their telephones,
you would have made a poor prediction
about their economic growth
in the next two decades.
Country 1, that has a longer system of railways,
is actually India.
And Country 2 is China.
This is a very little known fact
about the two countries.
Yes, today China has a huge infrastructure advantage
over India.
But for many years,
until the late 1990s,
China had an infrastructure disadvantage
vis-a-vis India.
In developing countries,
the most common mode of transportation
is the railways,
and the British built a lot of railways in India.
India is the smaller of the two countries,
and yet it had a longer system of railways
until the late 1990s.
So clearly,
infrastructure doesn't explain
why China did better before the late 1990s,
as compared with India.
In fact, if you look at the evidence worldwide,
the evidence is more supportive of the view
that the infrastructure are actually the result of economic growth.
The economy grows,
government accumulates more resources,
and the government can invest in infrastructure --
rather than infrastructure being a cause
for economic growth.
And this is clearly the story
of the Chinese economic growth.
Let me look at this question more directly.
Is democracy bad for economic growth?
Now let's turn to two countries,
Country A and Country B.
Country A, in 1990,
had about $300 per capita GDP
as compared with Country B,
which had $460 in per capita GDP.
By 2008,
Country A has surpassed Country B
with $700 per capita GDP
as compared with $650 per capita GDP.
Both countries are in Asia.
If I were to ask you,
"Which are the two Asian countries?
And which one is a democracy?"
you may argue,
"Well, maybe Country A is China
and Country B is India."
In fact, Country A
is democratic India,
and Country B is Pakistan --
the country that has a long period
of military rule.
And it's very common
that we compare India with China.
That's because the two countries
have about the same population size.
But the more natural comparison
is actually between India and Pakistan.
Those two countries are geographically similar.
They have a complicated, but shared common history.
By that comparison,
democracy looks very, very good
in terms of economic growth.
So why do economists fall in love
with authoritarian governments?
One reason is the East Asian Model.
In East Asia,
we have had successful economic growth stories
such as Korea, Taiwan,
Hong Kong and Singapore.
Some of these economies
were ruled by authoritarian governments
in the 60s and 70s
and 1980s.
The problem with that view
is like asking all the winners of lotteries,
"Have you won the lottery?"
And they all tell you, "Yes, we have won the lottery."
And then you draw the conclusion
the odds of winning the lottery
are 100 percent.
The reason is you never go
and bother to ask the losers
who also purchased lottery tickets
and didn't end up winning the prize.
For each of these successful authoritarian governments
in East Asia,
there's a matched failure.
Korea succeeded, North Korea didn't.
Taiwan succeeded, China under Mao Zedong didn't.
Burma didn't succeed.
The Philippines didn't succeed.
If you look at the statistical evidence worldwide,
there's really no support for the idea
that authoritarian governments
hold a systematic edge over democracies
in terms of economic growth.
So the East Asian model
has this massive selection bias --
it is known as selecting on a dependent variable,
something we always tell our students to avoid.
So exactly why did China grow so much faster?
I will take you to the Cultural Revolution,
when China went mad,
and compare that country's performance with India
under Indira Gandhi.
The question there is: Which country did better,
China or India?
China was during the Cultural Revolution.
It turns out even during the Cultural Revolution,
China out-perfomed India
in terms of GDP growth
by an average of about 2.2 percent every year
in terms of per capita GDP.
So that's when China was mad.
The whole country went mad.
It must mean that the country
had something so advantageous to itself in terms of economic growth
to overcome the negative effects
of the Cultural Revolution.
The advantage the country had
was human capital --
nothing else but human capital.
This is the world development index indicator data
in the early 1990s.
And this is the earliest data that I can find.
The adult literacy rate in China
is 77 percent
as compared with 48 percent in India.
The contrast in literacy rates
is especially sharp
between Chinese women and Indian women.
I haven't told you about the definition of literacy.
In China, the definition of literacy
is the ability to read and write
1,500 Chinese characters.
In India, the definition of literacy,
operating definition of literacy,
is the ability, the grand ability,
to write your own name
in whatever language you happen to speak.
The gap between the two countries in terms of literacy
is much more substantial
than the data here indicated.
If you go to other sources of data
such as Human Development Index,
that data series,
go back to the early 1970s,
you see exactly the same contrast.
China held a huge advantage
in terms of human capital
vis-a-vis India.
Life expectancies:
as early as 1965,
China had a huge advantage in life expectancy.
On average, as a Chinese in 1965,
you lived 10 years more
than an average Indian.
So if you have a choice
between being a Chinese and being an Indian,
you would want to become a Chinese
in order to live 10 years longer.
If you made that decision in 1965,
the down side of that
is the next year we have the Cultural Revolution.
So you have to always think carefully
about these decisions.
If you cannot chose your nationality,
then you will want to become an Indian man.
Because, as an Indian man,
you have about two years of life expectancy advantage
vis-a-vis Indian women.
This is an extremely strange fact.
It's very rare among countries
to have this kind of pattern.
It shows the systematic discrimination and biases
in the Indian society
against women.
The good news is, by 2006,
India has closed the gap
between men and women
in terms of life expectancy.
Today, Indian women have a sizable life expectancy edge
over Indian men.
So India is reverting to the normal.
But India still has a lot of work to do
in terms of gender equality.
These are the two pictures
taken of garment factories in Guangdong Province
and garment factories in India.
In China, it's all women.
60 to 80 percent of the workforce in China is women
in the coastal part of the country,
whereas in India, it's all men.
Financial Times printed this picture
of an Indian textile factory
with the title, "India Poised to Overtake China in Textile."
By looking at these two pictures,
I say no, it won't overtake China for a while.
If you look at other East Asian countries,
women there play a hugely important role
in terms of economic take-off --
in terms of creating the manufacturing miracle
associated with East Asia.
India still has a long way to go
to catch up with China.
Then the issue is,
what about the Chinese political system?
You talk about human capital,
you talk about education and public health.
What about the political system?
Isn't it true that the one-party political system
has facilitated economic growth in China?
Actually, the answer is more nuanced and subtle than that.
It depends on a distinction that you draw
between statics of the political system
and the dynamics of the political system.
Statically, China is a one-party system,
authoritarian -- there's no question about it.
Dynamically, it has changed over time
to become less authoritarian and more democratic.
When you explain change --
for example, economic growth;
economic growth is about change --
when you explain change,
you use other things that have changed to explain change,
rather than using the constant to explain change.
Sometimes a fixed effect can explain change,
but a fixed effect only explains changes
in interaction with the things that change.
In terms of the political changes,
they have introduced village elections.
They have increased the security of proprietors.
And they have increased the security
with long-term land leases.
There are also financial reforms in rural China.
There is also a rural entrepreneurial revolution in China.
To me, the pace of political changes
is too slow, too gradual.
And my own view is the country
is going to face some substantial challenges,
because they have not moved further and faster on political reforms.
But nevertheless,
the system has moved in a more liberal direction,
moved in a more democratic direction.
You can apply exactly the same dynamic perspective on India.
In fact, when India was growing
at a Hindu rate of growth --
about one percent, two percent a year --
that was when India was least democratic.
Indira Gandhi declared emergency rule in 1975.
The Indian government owned and operated
all the TV stations.
A little-known fact about India in the 1990s
is that the country
not only has undertaken economic reforms,
the country has also undertaken political reforms
by introducing village self-rule,
privatization of media
and introducing freedom of information acts.
So the dynamic perspective
fits both with China and in India
in terms of the direction.
Why do many people believe
that India is still a growth disaster?
One reason
is they are always comparing India with China.
But China is a superstar
in terms of economic growth.
If you are a NBA player
and you are always being compared to Michael Jordan,
you're going to look not so impressive.
But that doesn't mean
that you're a bad basketball player.
Comparing with a superstar
is the wrong benchmark.
In fact, if you compare India
with the average developing country,
even before the more recent period
of acceleration of Indian growth --
now India is growing between eight and nine percent --
even before this period,
India was ranked fourth in terms of economic growth
among emerging economies.
This is a very impressive record indeed.
Let's think about the future:
the dragon vis-a-vis the elephant.
Which country has the growth momentum?
China, I believe, still has
some of the excellent raw fundamentals --
mostly the social capital,
the public health,
the sense of egalitarianism
that you don't find in India.
But I believe that India has the momentum.
It has the improving fundamentals.
The government has invested in basic education,
has invested in basic health.
I believe the government should do more,
but nevertheless, the direction it is moving in
is the right direction.
India has the right institutional conditions
for economic growth,
whereas China is still struggling
with political reforms.
I believe that the political reforms are a must for China
to maintain its growth.
And it's very important to have political reforms,
to have widely shared benefits of economic growth.
I don't know whether that's going to happen or not,
but I'm an optimist.
Hopefully, five years from now, I'm going to report to TEDGlobal
that political reforms will happen in China.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
Hi everyone.
I'm an artist and a dad -- second time around.
Thank you.
And I want to share with you my latest art project.
It's a children's book for the iPad.
It's a little quirky and silly.
It's called "Pop-It,"
And it's about the things little kids do with their parents.
(Music)
So this is about potty training --
as most of you, I hope, know.
You can tickle the rug.
You can make the baby poop.
You can do all those fun things.
You can burst bubbles.
You can draw, as everyone should.
But you know, I have a problem with children's books:
I think they're full of propaganda.
At least an Indian trying to get one of these American books in Park Slope, forget it.
It's not the way I was brought up.
So I said, "I'm going to counter this with my own propaganda."
If you notice carefully,
it's a homosexual couple bringing up a child.
You don't like it?
Shake it, and you have a lesbian couple.
(Laughter)
Shake it, and you have a heterosexual couple.
You know, I don't even believe in the concept of an ideal family.
I have to tell you about my childhood.
I went to this very proper Christian school
taught by nuns, fathers, brothers, sisters.
Basically, I was brought up to be a good Samaritan,
and I am.
And I'd go at the end of the day to a traditional Hindu house,
which was probably the only Hindu house
in a predominantly Islamic neighborhood.
Basically, I celebrated every religious function.
In fact, when there was a wedding in our neighborhood,
all of us would paint our houses for the wedding.
I remember we cried profusely
when the little goats we played with in the summer
became biriani.
(Laughter)
We all had to fast during Ramadan.
It was a very beautiful time.
But I must say,
I'll never forget, when I was 13 years old, this happened.
Babri Masjid --
one of the most beautiful mosques in India,
built by King Babur, I think, in the 16th century --
was demolished by Hindu activists.
This caused major riots in my city.
And for the first time,
I was affected
by this communal unrest.
My little five-year-old kid neighbor
comes running in,
and he says, "Rags, Rags.
You know the Hindus are killing us Muslims. Be careful."
I'm like, "Dude, I'm Hindu."
(Laughter)
He's like, "Huh!"
You know, my work is inspired
by events such as this.
Even in my gallery shows,
I try and revisit historic events
like Babri Masjid,
distill only its emotional residue
and image my own life.
Imagine history being taught differently.
Remember that children's book
where you shake and the sexuality of the parents change?
I have another idea.
It's a children's book about Indian independence --
very patriotic.
But when you shake it, you get Pakistan's perspective.
Shake it again, and you get the British perspective.
(Applause)
You have to separate fact from bias, right.
Even my books on children
have cute, fuzzy animals.
But they're playing geopolitics.
They're playing out Israel-Palestine,
India-Pakistan.
You know, I'm making a very important argument.
And my argument [is]
that the only way for us to teach creativity
is by teaching children perspectives
at the earliest stage.
After all, children's books are manuals on parenting,
so you better give them children's books that teach them perspectives.
And conversely,
only when you teach perspectives
will a child be able to imagine
and put themselves in the shoes
of someone who is different from them.
I'm making an argument that art and creativity
are very essential tools in empathy.
You know, I can't promise my child
a life without bias --
we're all biased --
but I promise to bias my child with multiple perspectives.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
My students often ask me,
"What is sociology?"
And I tell them it's the study of the way
in which human beings are shaped
by things that they don't see.
And they say, "So,
how can I be a sociologist?
How can I understand
those invisible forces?"
And I say, "Empathy.
Start with empathy.
It all begins with empathy.
Take yourself out of your shoes,
put yourself into the shoes
of another person."
Here, I'll give you an example.
So I imagine my life
if, a hundred years ago,
China had been the most powerful
nation in the world
and they came to the United States
in search of coal.
And they found it, and, in fact,
they found lots of it right here.
And pretty soon,
they began shipping that coal,
ton by ton,
railcar by railcar, boatload by boatload,
back to China and elsewhere
around the world.
And they got fabulously
wealthy in doing so.
And they built beautiful cities
all powered on that coal.
And back here in the United States,
we saw economic despair, deprivation.
This is what I saw.
I saw people struggling to get by,
not knowing what was what
and what was next.
And I asked myself the question:
How is it possible that we could
be so poor here in the United States,
because coal is such a wealthy
resource; it's so much money?
And I realize:
because the Chinese ingratiated themselves
with a small ruling class
here in the United States,
who stole all of that money
and all of that wealth for themselves.
And the rest of us,
the vast majority of us,
struggle to get by.
And the Chinese
gave this small ruling elite
loads of military weapons
and sophisticated technology
in order to ensure that people like me
would not speak out
against this relationship.
Does this sound familiar?
And they did things like train Americans
to help protect the coal.
And everywhere, there were
symbols of the Chinese --
everywhere, a constant reminder.
And back in China,
what do they say in China?
Nothing! They don't talk about us.
They don't talk about the coal.
If you ask them,
they'll say, "Well, you know,
we need the coal.
I mean, come on, I'm not going
to turn down my thermostat.
You can't expect that."
And so, I get angry, and I get pissed,
as do lots of average people.
And we fight back,
and it gets really ugly.
And the Chinese respond
in a very ugly way.
And before we know it,
they send in the tanks
and they send in the troops.
And lots of people are dying.
And it's a very, very difficult situation.
Can you imagine what you would feel
if you were in my shoes?
Can you imagine
walking out of this building
and seeing a tank sitting out there,
or a truck full of soldiers?
Just imagine what you would feel,
because you know why they're here;
you know what they're doing here.
And you just feel the anger
and you feel the fear.
If you can, that's empathy.
That's empathy.
You've left your shoes,
and you've stood in mine.
And you've got to feel that.
OK, so that's the warm-up.
That's the warm-up.
Now we're going to have
the real radical experiment.
So, for the remainder of my talk,
what I want you to do
is put yourselves in the shoes
of an ordinary Arab Muslim
living in the Middle East --
in particular, in Iraq.
And so to help you,
perhaps you're a member
of this middle-class family in Baghdad.
What you want is the best for your kids.
You want your kids to have a better life.
And you watch the news, you pay attention.
You read the newspaper, you go down
to the coffee shop with your friends,
you read the newspapers
from around the world.
Sometimes you even watch satellite,
CNN, from the United States.
You have a sense of what
the Americans are thinking.
But really, you just want
a better life for yourself.
That's what you want.
You're Arab Muslim living in Iraq.
You want a better life for yourself.
So here, let me help you.
Let me help you with some things
that you might be thinking.
Number one:
this incursion into your land
these past 20 years and before --
the reason anyone
is interested in your land,
and particularly
the United States, is oil.
It's all about oil; you know that,
everybody knows that.
People back in the United States
know it's about oil.
It's because somebody else
has a design for your resource.
It's your resource --
it's not somebody else's.
It's your land; it's your resource.
Somebody else has a design for it.
And you know why they have a design?
You know why they have
their eyes set on it?
Because they have
an entire economic system
that's dependent
on that oil -- foreign oil,
oil from other parts of the world
that they don't own.
And what else do you think
about these people?
The Americans, they're rich.
Come on, they live in big houses,
they have big cars.
They all have blond hair,
blue eyes. They're happy.
You think that. It's not true, of course,
but that's the media impression.
And that's what you get.
And they have big cities,
and the cities are all dependent on oil.
And back home, what do you see?
Poverty, despair, struggle.
Look, you don't live in a wealthy country.
I mean -- this is Iraq.
This is what you see.
You see people struggling to get by.
It's not easy; you see a lot of poverty.
And you feel something about this.
These people have designs
for your resource,
and this is what you see?
Something else you see
that you talk about --
Americans don't talk
about this, but you do --
there's this thing,
this militarization of the world,
and it's centered
right in the United States.
And the United States is responsible
for almost one half
of the world's military spending.
Four percent of the world's population!
And you feel it; you see it every day.
It's part of your life.
And you talk about it with your friends.
You read about it.
And back when Saddam Hussein was in power,
the Americans didn't care
about his crimes.
When he was gassing
the Kurds and gassing Iran,
they didn't care about it.
When oil was at stake,
somehow, suddenly, things mattered.
And what you see, something else:
the United States,
the hub of democracy around the world --
they don't seem to really be supporting
democratic countries
all around the world.
There are a lot of countries,
oil-producing countries,
that aren't very democratic,
but supported by the United States.
That's odd.
Oh -- these incursions, these two wars,
the 10 years of sanctions,
the eight years of occupation,
the insurgency that's been
unleashed on your people,
the tens of thousands,
the hundreds of thousands
of civilian deaths?
All because of oil.
You can't help but think that.
You talk about it.
It's in the forefront
of your mind, always.
You say, "How is that possible?"
And this man, he's everyman --
your grandfather, your uncle,
your father, your son, your neighbor,
your professor, your student.
Once a life of happiness and joy
and suddenly, pain and sorrow.
Everyone in your country
has been touched by the violence,
the bloodshed, the pain,
the horror -- everybody.
Not a single person in your country
has not been touched.
But there's something else.
There's something else about these people,
these Americans who are there.
There's something else
about them that you see
that they don't see themselves.
And what do you see? They're Christians!
They're Christians.
They worship the Christian God,
they have crosses, they carry Bibles.
Their Bibles have a little insignia
that says "US Army" on them.
And their leaders, their leaders:
before they send their sons and daughters
off to war in your country --
and you know the reason --
before they send them off,
they go to a Christian church,
and they pray to their Christian God,
and they ask for protection
and guidance from that god.
Why?
Well, obviously,
when people die in the war,
they are Muslims, they are Iraqis --
they're not Americans.
You don't want Americans to die --
"Protect Our Troops."
And you feel something about that --
of course you do.
And they do wonderful things.
You read about it, you hear about it.
They're there to build schools
and help people.
That's what they want to do.
They do wonderful things,
but they also do the bad things,
and you can't tell the difference.
And this guy, you get a guy
like Lt. Gen. William Boykin.
Here's a guy who says
that your god is a false god.
Your god's an idol;
his god is the true god.
The solution to the problem
in the Middle East, according to him,
is to convert you all to Christianity --
just get rid of your religion.
And you know that.
Americans don't read about this guy.
They don't know anything
about him, but you do.
You pass it around.
You pass his words around.
I mean, this is serious. You're afraid.
He was one of the leading commanders
in the second invasion of Iraq.
And you're thinking,
"My God, if this guy is saying that,
then all the soldiers
must be saying that."
And this word here --
George Bush called this war a crusade.
Man, the Americans,
they're just like, "Ah, crusade.
Whatever. I don't know what that means."
You know what it means --
it's a holy war against Muslims.
Look, invade, subdue them,
take their resources.
If they won't submit, kill them.
That's what this is about.
And you're thinking, "My God,
these Christians are coming to kill us."
This is frightening.
You feel frightened.
Of course you feel frightened.
And this man, Terry Jones:
I mean here's a guy
who wants to burn Qurans, right?
And the Americans:
"Ah, he's a knucklehead.
He's a former hotel manager; he's got
three dozen members of his church ..."
They laugh him off.
You don't laugh him off,
because in the context of everything else,
all the pieces fit.
Of course this is how Americans think.
So people all over the Middle East,
not just in your country,
are protesting.
"He wants to burn Qurans, our holy book.
These Christians --
who are these Christians?
They're so evil, they're so mean --
this is what they're about?"
This is what you're thinking
as an Arab Muslim,
as an Iraqi.
Of course you're going to think this.
And then your cousin says,
"Hey coz, check out this website.
You've got to see this -- Bible Boot Camp.
These Christians are nuts!
They're training their little kids
to be soldiers for Jesus.
They take little kids
and run them through these things
till they teach them
how to say, 'Sir! Yes, sir!'
and things like 'grenade toss'
and 'weapons care and maintenance.'
And go to the website --
it says 'US Army' right on it.
I mean, these Christians, they're nuts.
How can they do this
to their little kids?"
And you're reading this website.
And of course, Christians
in the United States, or anybody,
says, "This is some little church
in the middle of nowhere."
You don't know that.
For you, this is like, all Christians.
It's all over the Web: "Bible Boot Camp."
And look at this.
They even teach their kids --
they train them in the same way
the US Marines train.
Isn't that interesting.
And it scares you, and it frightens you.
So these guys, you see them.
You see, I, Sam Richards --
I know who these guys are.
They're my students, my friends;
I know what they're thinking.
You don't know.
When you see them, they're something else.
They're something else.
That's what they are to you.
We don't see it that way
in the United States,
but you see it that way.
So here.
Of course, you've got it wrong.
You're generalizing. It's wrong.
You don't understand the Americans.
It's not a Christian invasion.
We're not just there for oil;
we're there for lots of reasons.
You have it wrong. You've missed it.
And of course, most of you
don't support the insurgency;
you don't support killing Americans;
you don't support the terrorists.
Of course you don't. Very few people do.
But -- some of you do.
And this is a perspective.
OK. So now, here's what we're going to do.
Step outside of your shoes
that you're in right now,
and step back into your normal shoes.
So everyone's back in the room. OK?
Now here comes the radical experiment.
So we're all back home.
This photo: this woman --
man, I feel her.
I feel her.
She's my sister,
my wife, my cousin, my neighbor.
She's anybody to me.
These guys standing there,
everybody in the photo --
I feel this photo, man.
So here's what I want you to do.
Let's go back to my first
example, of the Chinese.
I want you to go there.
It's all about coal, and the Chinese
are here in the United States.
What I want you to do is picture her
as a Chinese woman
receiving a Chinese flag
because her loved one has died
in America in the coal uprising.
And the soldiers are Chinese,
and everybody else is Chinese.
As an American, how do you feel
about this picture?
What do you think about that scene?
OK, try this. Bring it back.
This is the scene here.
It's an American, American soldiers,
American woman who lost
her loved one in the Middle East,
in Iraq or Afghanistan.
Now, put yourself in the shoes,
go back to the shoes
of an Arab Muslim living in Iraq.
What are you feeling and thinking
about this photo,
about this woman?
OK,
now follow me on this,
because I'm taking a big risk here.
And so I'm going to invite you
to take a risk with me.
These gentlemen here, they're insurgents.
They were caught by the American soldiers,
trying to kill Americans.
And maybe they succeeded.
Maybe they succeeded.
Put yourself in the shoes
of the Americans who caught them.
Can you feel the rage?
Can you feel that you just want
to take these guys
and wring their necks?
Can you go there?
It shouldn't be that difficult.
You just -- oh, man.
Now, put yourself in their shoes.
Are they brutal killers
or patriotic defenders?
Which one?
Can you feel their anger,
their fear,
their rage
at what has happened in their country?
Can you imagine that maybe
one of them, in the morning,
bent down to their child
and hugged their child
and said, "Dear, I'll be back later.
I'm going out to defend
your freedom, your lives.
I'm going out to look out for us,
the future of our country."
Can you imagine that?
Can you imagine saying that?
Can you go there?
What do you think they're feeling?
You see, that's empathy.
It's also understanding.
[understand]
Now, you might ask,
"OK, Sam, so why do you
do this sort of thing?
Why would you use
this example of all examples?"
And I say, because.
You're allowed to hate these people.
You're allowed to just hate them
with every fiber of your being.
And if I can get you
to step into their shoes
and walk an inch -- one tiny inch --
then imagine the kind
of sociological analysis
that you can do in all other
aspects of your life.
You can walk a mile
when it comes to understanding why
that person's driving 40 miles per hour
in the passing lane;
or your teenage son;
or your neighbor who annoys you
by cutting his lawn on Sunday mornings.
Whatever it is, you can go so far.
And this is what I tell my students:
step outside of your tiny, little world.
Step inside of the tiny,
little world of somebody else.
And then do it again
and do it again and do it again.
And suddenly, all these tiny,
little worlds,
they come together in this complex web.
And they build a big, complex world.
And suddenly, without realizing it,
you're seeing the world differently.
Everything has changed.
Everything in your life has changed.
And that's, of course, what this is about.
Attend to other lives,
other visions.
Listen to other people,
enlighten ourselves.
I'm not saying that I support
the terrorists in Iraq.
But as a sociologist, what I am saying is:
I understand.
And now perhaps -- perhaps -- you do, too.
Thank you.
(Applause)
The two places
where I feel most free
aren't actually places.
They're moments.
The first is inside of dance.
Somewhere between
rising up against gravity
and the feeling that the air beneath me
is falling in love with my body's weight.
I'm dancing and the air is carrying me
like I might never come down.
The second place that I feel free
is after scoring a goal
on the soccer pitch.
My body floods with the chemical
that they put inside of EpiPens
to revive the dead,
and I am weightless,
raceless.
My story is this: I'm a curator
at a contemporary arts center,
but I don't really believe in art
that doesn't bleed or sweat or cry.
I imagine that my kids
are going to live in a time
when the most valuable commodities
are fresh water and empathy.
I love pretty dances
and majestic sculpture
as much as the next guy,
but give me something else to go with it.
Lift me up with the aesthetic sublime
and give me a practice or some tools
to turn that inspiration
into understanding and action.
For instance, I'm a theater maker
who loves sports.
When I was making
my latest piece /peh-LO-tah/
I thought a lot about how soccer
was a means for my own immigrant family
to foster a sense of continuity
and normality and community
within the new context of the US.
In this heightened moment of xenophobia
and assault on immigrant identity,
I wanted to think through
how the game could serve
as an affirmational tool
for first-generation Americans
and immigrant kids,
to ask them to consider
movement patterns on the field
as kin to migratory patterns
across social and political borders.
Whether footballers or not,
immigrants in the US
play on endangered ground.
I wanted to help the kids understand
that the same muscle
that they use to plan the next goal
can also be used
to navigate the next block.
For me, freedom exists in the body.
We talk about it abstractly
and even divisively,
like "protect our freedom,"
"build this wall,"
"they hate us because of our freedom."
We have all these systems
that are beautifully designed
to incarcerate us or deport us,
but how do we design freedom?
For these kids, I wanted to track the idea
back to something that exists inside
that no one could take away,
so I developed this curriculum
that's part poli-sci class,
part soccer tournament,
inside of an arts festival.
It accesses /peh-LO-tah/'s
field of inquiry
to create a sports-based
political action for young people.
The project is called
"Moving and Passing."
It intersects curriculum development,
site-specific performance
and the politics of joy,
while using soccer as a metaphor
for the urgent question
of enfranchisement among immigrant youth.
Imagine that you are
a 15-year-old kid from Honduras
now living in Harlem,
or you're a 13-year-old girl born in DC
to two Nigerian immigrants.
You love the game.
You're on the field with your folks.
You've just been practicing
dribbling through cones
for, like, 15 minutes,
and then, all of a sudden,
a marching band comes down the field.
I want to associate the joy of the game
with the exuberance of culture,
to locate the site of joy in the game
at the same physical coordinate
as being politically informed by art,
a grass-laden theater for liberation.
We spend a week
looking at how the midfielder
would explain Black Lives Matter,
or how the goalkeeper
would explain gun control,
or how a defender's style
is the perfect metaphor
for the limits of American exceptionalism.
As we study positions on the field,
we also name and imagine our own freedoms.
I don't know, man, soccer is, like,
the only thing on this planet
that we can all agree to do together.
You know? It's like the official sport
of this spinning ball.
I want to be able
to connect the joy of the game
to the ever-moving footballer,
to connect that moving footballer
to immigrants who also moved
in sight of a better position.
Among these kids, I want
to connect their families' histories
to the bliss of a goal-scorer's run,
family like that feeling
after the ball beats the goalie,
the closest thing going to freedom.
Thank you.
(Applause)
I had a fire nine days ago.
My archive:
175 films, my 16-millimeter negative,
all my books, my dad's books, my photographs.
I'd collected --
I was a collector, major, big-time.
It's gone.
I just looked at it,
and I didn't know what to do.
I mean, this was --
was I my things?
I always live in the present -- I love the present.
I cherish the future.
And I was taught some strange thing as a kid,
like, you've got to make something good out of something bad.
You've got to make something good out of something bad.
This was bad! Man, I was --
I cough. I was sick.
That's my camera lens. The first one --
the one I shot my Bob Dylan film with 35 years ago.
That's my feature film. "King, Murray"
won Cannes Film Festival 1970 --
the only print I had.
That's my papers.
That was in minutes -- 20 minutes.
Epiphany hit me. Something hit me.
"You've got to make something good out of something bad,"
I started to say to my friends, neighbors, my sister.
By the way, that's "Sputnik." I ran it last year.
"Sputnik" was downtown, the negative. It wasn't touched.
These are some pieces of things I used in my Sputnik feature film,
which opens in New York in two weeks
downtown.
I called my sister. I called my neighbors. I said, "Come dig."
That's me at my desk.
That was a desk took 40-some years to build.
You know -- all the stuff.
That's my daughter, Jean.
She came. She's a nurse in San Francisco.
"Dig it up," I said. "Pieces.
I want pieces. Bits and pieces."
I came up with this idea: a life of bits and pieces,
which I'm just starting to work on -- my next project.
That's my sister. She took care of pictures,
because I was a big collector of snapshot photography
that I believed said a lot.
And those are some of the pictures that --
something was good about the burnt pictures.
I didn't know. I looked at that --
I said, "Wow, is that better than the --"
That's my proposal on Jimmy Doolittle. I made that movie for television.
It's the only copy I had. Pieces of it.
Idea about women.
So I started to say, "Hey, man, you are too much!
You could cry about this." I really didn't.
I just instead said,
"I'm going to make something out of it, and maybe next year ... "
And I appreciate this moment
to come up on this stage with so many people
who've already given me so much solace,
and just say to TEDsters:
I'm proud of me. That I take something bad,
I turn it, and I'm going to make something good out of this,
all these pieces.
That's Arthur Leipzig's original photograph I loved.
I was a big record collector --
the records didn't make it. Boy, I tell you,
film burns. Film burns.
I mean, this was 16-millimeter safety film.
The negatives are gone.
That's my father's letter to me, telling me to
marry the woman I first married when I was 20.
That's my daughter and me.
She's still there. She's there this morning, actually.
That's my house.
My family's living in the Hilton Hotel in Scotts Valley.
That's my wife, Heidi,
who didn't take it as well as I did.
My children, Davey and Henry.
My son, Davey, in the hotel two nights ago.
So, my message to you folks,
from my three minutes, is that I appreciate the chance
to share this with you. I will be back. I love being at TED.
I came to live it, and I am living it.
That's my view from my window outside of Santa Cruz, in Bonny Doon,
just 35 miles from here.
Thank you everybody.
(Applause)
Why grow homes? Because we can.
Right now, America is in an unremitting state of trauma.
And there's a cause for that, all right.
We've got McPeople, McCars, McHouses.
As an architect, I have to confront something like this.
So what's a technology that will allow us
to make ginormous houses?
Well, it's been around for 2,500 years.
It's called pleaching, or grafting trees together,
or grafting inosculate matter into one contiguous, vascular system.
And we do something different
than what we did in the past;
we add kind of a modicum of intelligence to that.
We use CNC to make scaffolding
to train semi-epithetic matter, plants,
into a specific geometry
that makes a home that we call a Fab Tree Hab.
It fits into the environment. It is the environment.
It is the landscape, right?
And you can have a hundred million of these homes,
and it's great because they suck carbon.
They're perfect.
You can have 100 million families, or take things out of the suburbs,
because these are homes that are a part of the environment.
Imagine pre-growing a village --
it takes about seven to 10 years --
and everything is green.
So not only do we do the veggie house,
we also do the in-vitro meat habitat,
or homes that we're doing research on now in Brooklyn,
where, as an architecture office, we're for the first of its kind
to put in a molecular cell biology lab
and start experimenting with regenerative medicine
and tissue engineering
and start thinking about what the future would be
if architecture and biology became one.
So we've been doing this for a couple of years, and that's our lab.
And what we do is we grow
extracellular matrix from pigs.
We use a modified inkjet printer,
and we print geometry.
We print geometry where we can make industrial design objects
like, you know, shoes, leather belts,
handbags, etc.,
where no sentient creature is harmed.
It's victimless. It's meat from a test tube.
So our theory is that eventually
we should be doing this with homes.
So here is a typical stud wall,
an architectural construction,
and this is a section
of our proposal for a meat house,
where you can see we use fatty cells as insulation,
cilia for dealing with wind loads
and sphincter muscles for the doors and windows.
(Laughter)
And we know it's incredibly ugly.
It could have been an English Tudor or Spanish Colonial,
but we kind of chose this shape.
And there it is kind of grown, at least one particular section of it.
We had a big show in Prague,
and we decided to put it in front of the cathedral
so religion can confront the house of meat.
That's why we grow homes. Thanks very much.
(Applause)
I was speaking to a group of about 300 kids,
ages six to eight, at a children's museum,
and I brought with me a bag full of legs,
similar to the kinds of things you see up here,
and had them laid out on a table for the kids.
And, from my experience, you know, kids are naturally curious
about what they don't know, or don't understand,
or is foreign to them.
They only learn to be frightened of those differences
when an adult influences them to behave that way,
and maybe censors that natural curiosity,
or you know, reins in the question-asking
in the hopes of them being polite little kids.
So I just pictured a first grade teacher out in the lobby
with these unruly kids, saying, "Now, whatever you do,
don't stare at her legs."
But, of course, that's the point.
That's why I was there, I wanted to invite them to look and explore.
So I made a deal with the adults
that the kids could come in without any adults for two minutes
on their own.
The doors open, the kids descend on this table of legs,
and they are poking and prodding, and they're wiggling toes,
and they're trying to put their full weight on the sprinting leg
to see what happens with that.
And I said, "Kids, really quickly --
I woke up this morning, I decided I wanted to be able to jump over a house --
nothing too big, two or three stories --
but, if you could think of any animal, any superhero, any cartoon character,
anything you can dream up right now,
what kind of legs would you build me?"
And immediately a voice shouted, "Kangaroo!"
"No, no, no! Should be a frog!"
"No. It should be Go Go Gadget!"
"No, no, no! It should be the Incredibles."
And other things that I don't -- aren't familiar with.
And then, one eight-year-old said,
"Hey, why wouldn't you want to fly too?"
And the whole room, including me, was like, "Yeah."
(Laughter)
And just like that, I went from being a woman
that these kids would have been trained to see as "disabled"
to somebody that had potential that their bodies didn't have yet.
Somebody that might even be super-abled.
Interesting.
So some of you actually saw me at TED, 11 years ago.
And there's been a lot of talk about how life-changing this conference is
for both speakers and attendees, and I am no exception.
TED literally was the launch pad to the next decade of my life's exploration.
At the time, the legs I presented were groundbreaking in prosthetics.
I had woven carbon fiber sprinting legs
modeled after the hind leg of a cheetah,
which you may have seen on stage yesterday.
And also these very life-like, intrinsically painted silicone legs.
So at the time, it was my opportunity to put a call out
to innovators outside the traditional medical prosthetic community
to come bring their talent to the science and to the art
of building legs.
So that we can stop compartmentalizing form, function and aesthetic,
and assigning them different values.
Well, lucky for me, a lot of people answered that call.
And the journey started, funny enough, with a TED conference attendee --
Chee Pearlman, who hopefully is in the audience somewhere today.
She was the editor then of a magazine called ID,
and she gave me a cover story.
This started an incredible journey.
Curious encounters were happening to me at the time;
I'd been accepting numerous invitations to speak
on the design of the cheetah legs around the world.
And people would come up to me after the conference, after my talk,
men and women.
And the conversation would go something like this,
"You know Aimee, you're very attractive.
You don't look disabled."
(Laughter)
I thought, "Well, that's amazing,
because I don't feel disabled."
And it really opened my eyes to this conversation
that could be explored, about beauty.
What does a beautiful woman have to look like?
What is a sexy body?
And interestingly, from an identity standpoint,
what does it mean to have a disability?
I mean, people -- Pamela Anderson has more prosthetic in her body than I do.
Nobody calls her disabled.
(Laughter)
So this magazine, through the hands of graphic designer Peter Saville,
went to fashion designer Alexander McQueen, and photographer Nick Knight,
who were also interested in exploring that conversation.
So, three months after TED I found myself on a plane
to London, doing my first fashion shoot,
which resulted in this cover --
"Fashion-able"?
Three months after that, I did my first runway show for Alexander McQueen
on a pair of hand-carved wooden legs made from solid ash.
Nobody knew -- everyone thought they were wooden boots.
Actually, I have them on stage with me:
grapevines, magnolias -- truly stunning.
Poetry matters.
Poetry is what elevates the banal and neglected object
to a realm of art.
It can transform the thing that might have made people fearful
into something that invites them to look,
and look a little longer,
and maybe even understand.
I learned this firsthand with my next adventure.
The artist Matthew Barney, in his film opus called the "The Cremaster Cycle."
This is where it really hit home for me --
that my legs could be wearable sculpture.
And even at this point, I started to move away from the need to replicate human-ness
as the only aesthetic ideal.
So we made what people lovingly referred to as glass legs
even though they're actually optically clear polyurethane,
a.k.a. bowling ball material.
Heavy!
Then we made these legs that are cast in soil
with a potato root system growing in them, and beetroots out the top,
and a very lovely brass toe.
That's a good close-up of that one.
Then another character was a half-woman, half-cheetah --
a little homage to my life as an athlete.
14 hours of prosthetic make-up
to get into a creature that had articulated paws,
claws and a tail that whipped around,
like a gecko.
(Laughter)
And then another pair of legs we collaborated on were these --
look like jellyfish legs,
also polyurethane.
And the only purpose that these legs can serve,
outside the context of the film,
is to provoke the senses and ignite the imagination.
So whimsy matters.
Today, I have over a dozen pair of prosthetic legs
that various people have made for me,
and with them I have different negotiations of the terrain under my feet,
and I can change my height --
I have a variable of five different heights.
(Laughter)
Today, I'm 6'1".
And I had these legs made a little over a year ago
at Dorset Orthopedic in England
and when I brought them home to Manhattan,
my first night out on the town, I went to a very fancy party.
And a girl was there who has known me for years
at my normal 5'8".
Her mouth dropped open when she saw me,
and she went, "But you're so tall!"
And I said, "I know. Isn't it fun?"
I mean, it's a little bit like wearing stilts on stilts,
but I have an entirely new relationship to door jams
that I never expected I would ever have.
And I was having fun with it.
And she looked at me,
and she said, "But, Aimee, that's not fair."
(Laughter)
(Applause)
And the incredible thing was she really meant it.
It's not fair that you can change your height,
as you want it.
And that's when I knew --
that's when I knew that the conversation with society
has changed profoundly
in this last decade.
It is no longer a conversation about overcoming deficiency.
It's a conversation about augmentation.
It's a conversation about potential.
A prosthetic limb doesn't represent the need to replace loss anymore.
It can stand as a symbol that the wearer
has the power to create whatever it is that they want to create
in that space.
So people that society once considered to be disabled
can now become the architects of their own identities
and indeed continue to change those identities
by designing their bodies
from a place of empowerment.
And what is exciting to me so much right now
is that by combining cutting-edge technology --
robotics, bionics --
with the age-old poetry,
we are moving closer to understanding our collective humanity.
I think that if we want to discover the full potential
in our humanity,
we need to celebrate those heartbreaking strengths
and those glorious disabilities that we all have.
I think of Shakespeare's Shylock:
"If you prick us, do we not bleed,
and if you tickle us, do we not laugh?"
It is our humanity,
and all the potential within it,
that makes us beautiful.
Thank you.
(Applause)
For more than 100 years,
the telephone companies have provided
wiretapping assistance to governments.
For much of this time,
this assistance was manual.
Surveillance took place manually
and wires were connected by hand.
Calls were recorded to tape.
But as in so many other industries,
computing has changed everything.
The telephone companies
built surveillance features
into the very core of their networks.
I want that to sink in for a second:
Our telephones and the networks
that carry our calls
were wired for surveillance first.
First and foremost.
So what that means is that
when you're talking to your spouse,
your children, a colleague
or your doctor on the telephone,
someone could be listening.
Now, that someone might
be your own government;
it could also be another government,
a foreign intelligence service,
or a hacker, or a criminal, or a stalker
or any other party that breaks into
the surveillance system,
that hacks into the surveillance system
of the telephone companies.
But while the telephone companies
have built surveillance as a priority,
Silicon Valley companies have not.
And increasingly,
over the last couple years,
Silicon Valley companies have built
strong encryption technology
into their communications products
that makes surveillance
extremely difficult.
For example, many of you
might have an iPhone,
and if you use an iPhone
to send a text message
to other people who have an iPhone,
those text messages
cannot easily be wiretapped.
And in fact, according to Apple,
they're not able to even see
the text messages themselves.
Likewise, if you use FaceTime
to make an audio call
or a video call with one of your
friends or loved ones,
that, too, cannot be easily wiretapped.
And it's not just Apple.
WhatsApp, which is now owned by Facebook
and used by hundreds of millions
of people around the world,
also has built strong
encryption technology into its product,
which means that people
in the Global South can easily communicate
without their governments,
often authoritarian,
wiretapping their text messages.
So, after 100 years of being able
to listen to any telephone call --
anytime, anywhere --
you might imagine that government
officials are not very happy.
And in fact, that's what's happening.
Government officials are extremely mad.
And they're not mad because
these encryption tools are now available.
What upsets them the most
is that the tech companies have built
encryption features into their products
and turned them on by default.
It's the default piece that matters.
In short, the tech companies
have democratized encryption.
And so, government officials
like British Prime Minister David Cameron,
they believe that all communications --
emails, texts, voice calls --
all of these should be
available to governments,
and encryption is making that difficult.
Now, look -- I'm extremely sympathetic
to their point of view.
We live in a dangerous time
in a dangerous world,
and there really are bad people out there.
There are terrorists and other
serious national security threats
that I suspect we all want
the FBI and the NSA to monitor.
But those surveillance
features come at a cost.
The reason for that is
that there is no such thing
as a terrorist laptop,
or a drug dealer's cell phone.
We all use the same
communications devices.
What that means is that
if the drug dealers' telephone calls
or the terrorists' telephone calls
can be intercepted,
then so can the rest of ours, too.
And I think we really need to ask:
Should a billion people
around the world be using devices
that are wiretap friendly?
So the scenario of hacking of surveillance
systems that I've described --
this is not imaginary.
In 2009,
the surveillance systems that Google
and Microsoft built into their networks --
the systems that they use to respond
to lawful surveillance requests
from the police --
those systems were compromised
by the Chinese government,
because the Chinese government
wanted to figure out
which of their own agents
the US government was monitoring.
By the same token,
in 2004, the surveillance system
built into the network
of Vodafone Greece --
Greece's largest telephone company --
was compromised by an unknown entity,
and that feature,
the surveillance feature,
was used to wiretap
the Greek Prime Minister
and members of the Greek cabinet.
The foreign government or hackers
who did that were never caught.
And really, this gets to the very problem
with these surveillance features,
or backdoors.
When you build a backdoor
into a communications network
or piece of technology,
you have no way of controlling
who's going to go through it.
You have no way of controlling
whether it'll be used by your side
or the other side,
by good guys, or by bad guys.
And so for that reason,
I think that it's better
to build networks
to be as secure as possible.
Yes, this means that in the future,
encryption is going to make
wiretapping more difficult.
It means that the police
are going to have a tougher time
catching bad guys.
But the alternative would mean
to live in a world
where anyone's calls or anyone's
text messages could be surveilled
by criminals, by stalkers
and by foreign intelligence agencies.
And I don't want to live
in that kind of world.
And so right now,
you probably have the tools
to thwart many kinds
of government surveillance
already on your phones
and already in your pockets,
you just might not realize how strong
and how secure those tools are,
or how weak the other ways
you've used to communicate really are.
And so, my message to you is this:
We need to use these tools.
We need to secure our telephone calls.
We need to secure our text messages.
I want you to use these tools.
I want you to tell your loved ones,
I want you to tell your colleagues:
Use these encrypted communications tools.
Don't just use them
because they're cheap and easy,
but use them because they're secure.
Thank you.
(Applause)
I consider it my life's mission
to convey the urgency
of climate change through my work.
I've traveled north to the Arctic
to the capture the unfolding story
of polar melt,
and south to the Equator to document
the subsequent rising seas.
Most recently, I visited
the icy coast of Greenland
and the low-lying islands of the Maldives,
connecting two seemingly disparate
but equally endangered
parts of our planet.
My drawings explore moments
of transition, turbulence
and tranquility in the landscape,
allowing viewers to emotionally connect
with a place you might never
have the chance to visit.
I choose to convey the beauty
as opposed to the devastation.
If you can experience the sublimity
of these landscapes,
perhaps you'll be inspired
to protect and preserve them.
Behavioral psychology tells us
that we take action
and make decisions based
on our emotions above all else.
And studies have shown
that art impacts our emotions
more effectively than a scary news report.
Experts predict ice-free Arctic summers
as early as 2020.
And sea levels are likely to rise
between two and ten feet
by century's end.
I have dedicated my career
to illuminating these projections
with an accessible medium,
one that moves us in a way
that statistics may not.
My process begins
with traveling to the places
at the forefront of climate change.
On-site, I take thousands of photographs.
Back in the studio,
I work from both my memory
of the experience and the photographs
to create very large-scale compositions,
sometimes over 10 feet wide.
I draw with soft pastel, which is dry
like charcoal, but colors.
I consider my work drawings
but others call them painting.
I cringe, though, when I'm referred to
as a "finger painter."
(Laughter)
But I don't use any tools
and I have always used
my fingers and palms
to manipulate the pigment on the paper.
Drawing is a form of meditation for me.
It quiets my mind.
I don't perceive what I'm drawing
as ice or water.
Instead, the image is stripped down
to its most basic form of color and shape.
Once the piece is complete,
I can finally experience
the composition as a whole,
as an iceberg floating
through glassy water,
or a wave cresting with foam.
On average, a piece this size
takes me about,
as you can see, 10 seconds.
(Laughter)
(Applause)
Really, more like 200 hours,
250 hours for something that size.
But I've been drawing ever since
I could hold a crayon, really.
My mom was an artist, and growing up,
we always had art supplies
all over the house.
My mother's love of photography
propelled her to the most
remote regions of the earth,
and my family and I were fortunate enough
to join and support her
on these adventures.
We rode camels in Northern Africa
and mushed on dog sleds
near the North Pole.
In August of 2012,
I led my first expedition,
taking a group of artists and scholars
up the northwest coast of Greenland.
My mother was originally
supposed to lead this trip.
She and I were in the early
stages of planning,
as we had intended to go together,
when she fell victim to a brain tumor.
The cancer quickly took over
her body and mind,
and she passed away six months later.
During the months of her illness, though,
her dedication to the expedition
never wavered, and I made a promise
to carry out her final journey.
My mother's passion for the Arctic
echoed through my experience in Greenland,
and I felt the power
and the fragility of the landscape.
The sheer size of the icebergs
is humbling.
The ice fields are alive
with movement and sound
in a way that I never expected.
I expanded the scale of my compositions
to give you that same sense of awe
that I experienced.
Yet, while the grandeur
of the ice is evident,
so, too, is its vulnerability.
From our boat,
I could see the ice sweating
under the unseasonably warm sun.
We had a chance to visit
many of the Inuit communities in Greenland
that now face huge challenges.
The locals spoke to me
of vast areas of sea ice
that are no longer
freezing over as they once did.
And without ice, their hunting
and harvesting grounds
are severely diminished,
threatening their way
of life and survival.
The melting glaciers in Greenland
are one of the largest
contributing factors to rising sea levels,
which have already begun to drown
some of our world's lowest-lying islands.
One year after my trip to Greenland,
I visited the Maldives,
the lowest and flattest country
in the entire world.
While I was there, I collected
images and inspiration
for a new body of work:
drawings of waves lapping
on the coast of a nation
that could be entirely underwater
within this century.
Devastating events happen every day
on scales both global and personal.
When I was in Greenland,
I scattered my mother's ashes
amidst the melting ice.
Now she remains a part
of the landscape she loved so much,
even as it, too, passes
and takes on new form.
Among the many gifts my mother gave me
was the ability to focus on the positive,
rather than the negative.
My drawings celebrate the beauty
of what we all stand to lose.
I hope they can serve as records
of sublime landscapes in flux,
documenting the transition
and inspiring our global community
to take action for the future.
Thank you.
(Applause)
My travels to Afghanistan
began many, many years ago
on the eastern border of my country,
my homeland, Poland.
I was walking through the forests
of my grandmother's tales.
A land where every field hides a grave,
where millions of people
have been deported or killed
in the 20th century.
Behind the destruction,
I found a soul of places.
I met humble people.
I heard their prayer
and ate their bread.
Then I have been walking East for 20 years --
from Eastern Europe to Central Asia --
through the Caucasus Mountains,
Middle East,
North Africa,
Russia.
And I ever met more humble people.
And I shared their bread and their prayer.
This is why I went to Afghanistan.
One day, I crossed the bridge
over the Oxus River.
I was alone on foot.
And the Afghan soldier was so surprised to see me
that he forgot to stamp my passport.
But he gave me a cup of tea.
And I understood
that his surprise was my protection.
So I have been walking and traveling,
by horses, by yak, by truck, by hitchhiking,
from Iran's border
to the bottom, to the edge of the Wakhan Corridor.
And in this way
I could find noor, the hidden light of Afghanistan.
My only weapon
was my notebook and my Leica.
I heard prayers of the Sufi --
humble Muslims,
hated by the Taliban.
Hidden river,
interconnected with the mysticism
from Gibraltar to India.
The mosque where the respectful foreigner
is showered with blessings
and with tears,
and welcomed as a gift.
What do we know
about the country and the people
that we pretend to protect,
about the villages
where the only one medicine
to kill the pain and to stop the hunger
is opium?
These are opium-addicted people
on the roofs of Kabul
10 years after the beginning of our war.
These are the nomad girls
who became prostitutes for Afghan businessmen.
What do we know about the women
10 years after the war?
Clothed in this nylon bag,
made in China,
with the name of burqa.
I saw one day,
the largest school in Afghanistan,
a girls' school.
13,000 girls
studying here
in the rooms underground,
full of scorpions.
And their love [for studying]
was so big that I cried.
What do we know
about the death threats by the Taliban
nailed on the doors
of the people who dare to send their daughters to school as in Balkh?
The region is not secure, but full of the Taliban,
and they did it.
My aim is to give a voice
to the silent people,
to show the hidden lights
behind the curtain of the great game,
the small worlds ignored by the media
and the prophets of a global conflict.
Thanks.
(Applause)
I'm talking to you about
the worst form of human rights violation,
the third-largest organized crime,
a $10 billion industry.
I'm talking to you about modern-day slavery.
I'd like to tell you the story
of these three children,
Pranitha, Shaheen and Anjali.
Pranitha's mother was a woman in prostitution,
a prostituted person.
She got infected with HIV,
and towards the end of her life,
when she was in the final stages of AIDS,
she could not prostitute,
so she sold four-year-old Pranitha to a broker.
By the time we got the information, we reached there,
Pranitha was already raped by three men.
Shaheen's background I don't even know.
We found her in a railway track,
raped by many, many men, I don't know many.
But the indications of that on her body was
that her intestine was outside her body.
And when we took her to the hospital
she needed 32 stitches to put back her intestine into her body.
We still don't know who her parents are, who she is.
All that we know that hundreds of men
had used her brutally.
Anjali's father, a drunkard,
sold his child for pornography.
You're seeing here images of
three years, four-year-olds, and five-year-old children
who have been trafficked for commercial sexual exploitation.
In this country, and across the globe,
hundreds and thousands of children,
as young as three, as young as four,
are sold into sexual slavery.
But that's not the only purpose that human beings are sold for.
They are sold in the name of adoption.
They are sold in the name of organ trade.
They are sold in the name of forced labor,
camel jockeying, anything, everything.
I work on the issue of commercial sexual exploitation.
And I tell you stories from there.
My own journey to work with these children
started as a teenager.
I was 15 when I was gang-raped by eight men.
I don't remember the rape part of it so much
as much as the anger part of it.
Yes, there were eight men who defiled me, raped me,
but that didn't go into my consciousness.
I never felt like a victim, then or now.
But what lingered from then till now -- I am 40 today --
is this huge outrageous anger.
Two years, I was ostracized, I was stigmatized, I was isolated,
because I was a victim.
And that's what we do to all traffic survivors.
We, as a society, we have PhDs
in victimizing a victim.
Right from the age of 15,
when I started looking around me,
I started seeing hundreds and thousands of women and children
who are left in sexual slavery-like practices,
but have absolutely no respite,
because we don't allow them to come in.
Where does their journey begin?
Most of them come from very optionless families,
not just poor.
You have even the middle class sometimes getting trafficked.
I had this I.S. officer's daughter,
who is 14 years old, studying in ninth standard,
who was raped chatting with one individual,
and ran away from home because she wanted to become a heroine,
who was trafficked.
I have hundreds and thousands of stories of very very well-to-do families,
and children from well-to-do families,
who are getting trafficked.
These people are deceived, forced.
99.9 percent of them
resist being inducted into prostitution.
Some pay the price for it.
They're killed; we don't even hear about them.
They are voiceless, [unclear],
nameless people.
But the rest, who succumb into it,
go through everyday torture.
Because the men who come to them are not men who want to make you your girlfriends,
or who want to have a family with you.
These are men who buy you for an hour, for a day,
and use you, throw you.
Each of the girls that I have rescued --
I have rescued more than 3,200 girls --
each of them tell me one story in common ...
(Applause)
one story about one man, at least,
putting chili powder in her vagina,
one man taking a cigarette and burning her,
one man whipping her.
We are living among those men: they're our brothers, fathers,
uncles, cousins, all around us.
And we are silent about them.
We think it is easy money.
We think it is shortcut.
We think the person likes to do what she's doing.
But the extra bonuses that she gets
is various infections, sexually transmitted infections,
HIV, AIDS, syphilis, gonorrhea, you name it,
substance abuse, drugs, everything under the sun.
And one day she gives up on you and me,
because we have no options for her.
And therefore she starts normalizing this exploitation.
She believes, "Yes, this is it, this is what my destiny is about."
And this is normal, to get raped by 100 men a day.
And it's abnormal to live in a shelter.
It's abnormal to get rehabilitated.
It's in that context that I work.
It's in that context that I rescue children.
I've rescued children as young as three years,
and I've rescued women as old as 40 years.
When I rescued them, one of the biggest challenges I had
was where do I begin.
Because I had lots of them
who were already HIV infected.
One third of the people I rescue
are HIV positive.
And therefore my challenge was to
understand how can I get out
the power from this pain.
And for me, I was my greatest experience.
Understanding my own self,
understanding my own pain,
my own isolation,
was my greatest teacher.
Because what we did with these girls
is to understand their potential.
You see a girl here who is trained as a welder.
She works for a very big company,
a workshop in Hyderabad,
making furnitures.
She earns around 12,000 rupees.
She is an illiterate girl,
trained, skilled as a welder.
Why welding and why not computers?
We felt, one of the things that these girls had
is immense amount of courage.
They did not have any pardas inside their body,
hijabs inside themselves;
they've crossed the barrier of it.
And therefore they could fight in a male-dominated world,
very easily, and not feel very shy about it.
We have trained girls as carpenters,
as masons,
as security guards, as cab drivers.
And each one of them are excelling
in their chosen field,
gaining confidence, restoring dignity,
and building hopes in their own lives.
These girls are also working in big construction companies
like Ram-ki construction, as masons, full-time masons.
What has been my challenge?
My challenge has not been the traffickers who beat me up.
I've been beaten up more than 14 times in my life.
I can't hear from my right ear.
I've lost a staff of mine who was murdered
while on a rescue.
My biggest challenge
is society.
It's you and me.
My biggest challenge is your blocks to accept these victims
as our own.
A very supportive friend of mine,
a well-wisher of mine,
used to give me every month, 2,000 rupees for vegetables.
When her mother fell sick she said,
"Sunitha, you have so much of contacts.
Can you get somebody in my house to work,
so that she can look after my mother?"
And there is a long pause.
And then she says, "Not one of our girls."
It's very fashionable to talk about human trafficking,
in this fantastic A-C hall.
It's very nice for discussion, discourse,
making films and everything.
But it is not nice to bring them to our homes.
It's not nice to give them employment in our factories, our companies.
It's not nice for our children to study with their children.
There it ends.
That's my biggest challenge.
If I'm here today, I'm here not only as Sunitha Krishnan.
I'm here as a voice of the victims and survivors of human trafficking.
They need your compassion.
They need your empathy.
They need, much more than anything else,
your acceptance.
Many times when I talk to people,
I keep telling them one thing:
don't tell me hundred ways
how you cannot respond to this problem.
Can you ply your mind for that one way
that you can respond to the problem?
And that's what I'm here for,
asking for your support,
demanding for your support,
requesting for your support.
Can you break your culture of silence?
Can you speak to at least two persons about this story?
Tell them this story. Convince them to tell the story to another two persons.
I'm not asking you all to become Mahatma Gandhis
or Martin Luther Kings, or Medha Patkars,
or something like that.
I'm asking you, in your limited world,
can you open your minds? Can you open your hearts?
Can you just encompass these people too?
Because they are also a part of us.
They are also part of this world.
I'm asking you, for these children,
whose faces you see, they're no more.
They died of AIDS last year.
I'm asking you to help them,
accept as human beings --
not as philanthropy, not as charity,
but as human beings who deserve all our support.
I'm asking you this because no child, no human being,
deserves what these children have gone through.
Thank you.
(Applause)
I thought I would think about changing your perspective on the world a bit,
and showing you some of the designs that we have in nature.
And so, I have my first slide to talk about
the dawning of the universe and what I call
the cosmic scene investigation, that is, looking at
the relics of creation and inferring what happened at the beginning,
and then following it up and trying to understand it.
And so one of the questions that I asked you is,
when you look around, what do you see?
Well, you see this space that's created by designers
and by the work of people, but what you actually see
is a lot of material that was already here,
being reshaped in a certain form.
And so the question is: how did that material get here?
How did it get into the form that it had before it got reshaped, and so forth?
It's a question of what's the continuity?
So one of the things I look at is,
how did the universe begin and shape?
What was the whole process in the creation and the evolution of the universe
to getting to the point that we have these kinds of materials?
So that's sort of the part, and let me move on then and show you
the Hubble Ultra Deep Field.
If you look at this picture,
what you will see is a lot of dark with some light objects in it.
And everything but -- four of these light objects are stars,
and you can see them there -- little pluses.
This is a star, this is a star, everything else is a galaxy, OK?
So there's a couple of thousand galaxies
you can see easily with your eye in here.
And when I look out at particularly this galaxy,
which looks a lot like ours, I wonder if there's
an art design college conference going on,
and intelligent beings there are thinking about, you know,
what designs they might do, and there might be a few cosmologists
trying to understand where the universe itself came from,
and there might even be some in that galaxy looking at ours
trying to figure out what's going on over here.
But there's a lot of other galaxies, and some are nearby,
and they're kind of the color of the Sun,
and some are further away and they're a little bluer, and so forth.
But one of the questions is -- this should be, to you --
how come there are so many galaxies?
Because this represents a very clean fraction of the sky.
This is only 1,000 galaxies.
We think there's on the order -- visible to the Hubble Space Telescope,
if you had the time to scan it around --
about 100 billion galaxies. Right?
It's a very large number of galaxies.
And that's roughly how many stars there are in our own galaxy.
But when you look at some of these regions like this, you'll see
more galaxies than stars, which is kind of a conundrum.
So the question should come to your mind is, what kind of design, you know,
what kind of creative process and what kind of design
produced the world like that?
And then I'm going to show you it's actually a lot more complicated.
We're going to try and follow it up.
We have a tool that actually helps us out in this study,
and that's the fact that the universe is so incredibly big
that it's a time machine, in a certain sense.
We draw this set of nested spheres cut away so you see it.
Put the Earth at the center of the nested spheres,
just because that's where we're making observations.
And the moon is only two seconds away, so if you take a picture of the moon
using ordinary light, it's the moon two seconds ago, and who cares.
Two seconds is like the present.
The Sun is eight minutes ago. That's not such a big deal, right,
unless there's solar flares coming then you want to get out the way.
You'd like to have a little advance warning.
But you get out to Jupiter and it's 40 minutes away. It's a problem.
You hear about Mars, it's a problem communicating to Mars
because it takes light long enough to go there.
But if you look out to the nearest set of stars,
to the nearest 40 or 50 stars, it's about 10 years.
So if you take a picture of what's going on, it's 10 years ago.
But you go and look to the center of the galaxy,
it's thousands of years ago.
If you look at Andromeda, which is the nearest big galaxy,
and it's two million years ago.
If you took a picture of the Earth two million years ago,
there'd be no evidence of humans at all,
because we don't think there were humans yet.
I mean, it just gives you the scale.
With the Hubble Space Telescope, we're looking at
hundreds of millions of years to a billion years.
But if we were capable to come up with an idea of how to look even further --
there's some things even further,
and that was what I did in a lot of my work,
was to develop the techniques -- we could look out back to even earlier
epochs before there were stars and before there were galaxies,
back to when the universe was hot and dense and very different.
And so that's the sort of sequence,
and so I have a more artistic impression of this.
There's the galaxy in the middle, which is the Milky Way,
and around that are the Hubble -- you know, nearby kind of galaxies,
and there's a sphere that marks the different times.
And behind that are some more modern galaxies.
You see the whole big picture?
The beginning of time is funny -- it's on the outside, right?
And then there's a part of the universe we can't see
because it's so dense and so hot, light can't escape.
It's like you can't see to the center of the Sun;
you have to use other techniques to know what's going on inside the Sun.
But you can see the edge of the Sun,
and the universe gets that way, and you can see that.
And then you see this sort of model area around the outside,
and that is the radiation coming from the Big Bang,
which is actually incredibly uniform.
The universe is almost a perfect sphere,
but there are these very tiny variations
which we show here in great exaggeration.
And from them in the time sequence we're going to have to go
from these tiny variations to these irregular galaxies and first stars
to these more advanced galaxies, and eventually the solar system, and so forth.
So it's a big design job,
but we'll see about how things are going on.
So the way these measurements were done,
there's been a set of satellites, and this is where you get to see.
So there was the COBE satellite, which was launched in 1989,
and we discovered these variations.
And then in 2000, the MAP satellite was launched -- the WMAP --
and it made somewhat better pictures.
And later this year -- this is the cool stealth version,
the one that actually has some beautiful design features to it,
and you should look -- the Planck satellite will be launched,
and it will make very high-resolution maps.
And that will be the sequence of understanding
the very beginning of the universe.
And what we saw was, we saw these variations, and then they told us
the secrets, both about the structure of space-time,
and about the contents of the universe,
and about how the universe started in its original motions.
So we have this picture, which is quite a spectacular picture,
and I'll come back to the beginning, where we're going to have
some mysterious process that kicks the universe off at the beginning.
And we go through a period of accelerating expansion, and the universe
expands and cools until it gets to the point where it becomes transparent,
then to the Dark Ages, and then the first stars turn on,
and they evolve into galaxies, and then later they get to the more expansive galaxies.
And somewhere around this period is when our solar system started forming.
And it's maturing up to the present time.
And there's some spectacular things.
And this wastebasket part, that's to represent
what the structure of space-time itself is doing during this period.
And so this is a pretty weird model, right?
What kind of evidence do we have for that?
So let me show you some of nature's patterns
that are the result of this.
I always think of space-time as being the real substance of space,
and the galaxies and the stars just like the foam on the ocean.
It's a marker of where the interesting waves are and whatever went on.
So here is the Sloan Digital Sky Survey showing the location of a million galaxies.
So there's a dot on here for every galaxy.
They go out and point a telescope at the sky, take a picture,
identify what are stars and throw them away, look at the galaxies,
estimate how far away they are, and plot them up.
And just put radially they're going out that way.
And you see these structures, this thing we call the Great Wall,
but there are voids and those kinds of stuff, and they kind of fade out
because the telescope isn't sensitive enough to do it.
Now I'm going to show you this in 3D.
What happens is, you take pictures
as the Earth rotates, you get a fan across the sky.
There are some places you can't look because of our own galaxy,
or because there are no telescopes available to do it.
So the next picture shows you the three-dimensional version of this rotating around.
Do you see the fan-like scans made across the sky?
Remember, every spot on here is a galaxy, and you see the galaxies,
you know, sort of in our neighborhood, and you sort of see the structure.
And you see this thing we call the Great Wall,
and you see the complicated structure, and you see these voids.
There are places where there are no galaxies and there are places
where there are thousands of galaxies clumped together, right.
So there's an interesting pattern,
but we don't have enough data here to actually see the pattern.
We only have a million galaxies, right?
So we're keeping, like, a million balls in the air
but, what's going on?
There's another survey which is very similar to this,
called the Two-degree Field of View Galaxy Redshift Survey.
Now we're going to fly through it at warp a million.
And every time there's a galaxy -- at its location there's a galaxy --
and if we know anything about the galaxy, which we do,
because there's a redshift measurement and everything,
you put in the type of galaxy and the color,
so this is the real representation.
And when you're in the middle of the galaxies
it's hard to see the pattern; it's like being in the middle of life.
It's hard to see the pattern in the middle of the audience,
it's hard to see the pattern of this.
So we're going to go out and swing around and look back at this.
And you'll see, first, the structure of the survey,
and then you'll start seeing the structure of the galaxies
that we see out there.
So again, you can see the extension of this Great Wall of galaxies showing up here.
But you can see the voids,
you can see the complicated structure, and you say,
well, how did this happen?
Suppose you're the cosmic designer.
How are you going to put galaxies out there in a pattern like that?
It's not just throwing them out at random.
There's a more complicated process going on here.
How are you going to end up doing that?
And so now we're in for some serious play.
That is, we have to seriously play God,
not just change people's lives, but make the universe, right.
So if that's your responsibility, how are you going to do that?
What's the kind of technique?
What's the kind of thing you're going to do?
So I'm going to show you the results of a very large-scale simulation
of what we think the universe might be like, using, essentially,
some of the play principles and some of the design principles that,
you know, humans have labored so hard to pick up,
but apparently nature knew how to do at the beginning.
And that is, you start out with very simple ingredients
and some simple rules,
but you have to have enough ingredients to make it complicated.
And then you put in some randomness,
some fluctuations and some randomness,
and realize a whole bunch of different representations.
So what I'm going to do is show you
the distribution of matter as a function of scales.
We're going to zoom in, but this is a plot of what it is.
And we had to add one more thing to make the universe come out right.
It's called dark matter.
That is matter that doesn't interact with light
the typical way that ordinary matter does,
the way the light's shining on me or on the stage.
It's transparent to light, but in order for you to see it,
we're going to make it white. OK?
So the stuff that's in this picture that's white, that is the dark matter.
It should be called invisible matter,
but the dark matter we've made visible.
And the stuff that is in the yellow color,
that is the ordinary kind of matter that's turned into stars and galaxies.
So I'll show you the next movie.
So this -- we're going to zoom in.
Notice this pattern and pay attention to this pattern.
We're going to zoom in and zoom in.
And you'll see there are all these filaments and structures and voids.
And when a number of filaments come together in a knot,
that makes a supercluster of galaxies.
This one we're zooming in on
is somewhere between 100,000 and a million galaxies in that small region.
So we live in the boonies.
We don't live in the center of the solar system,
we don't live in the center of the galaxy
and our galaxy's not in the center of the cluster.
So we're zooming in.
This is a region which probably has more than 100,000,
on the order of a million galaxies in that region.
We're going to keep zooming in. OK.
And so I forgot to tell you the scale.
A parsec is 3.26 light years.
So a gigaparsec is three billion light years -- that's the scale.
So it takes light three billion years to travel over that distance.
Now we're into a distance sort of between here and here.
That's the distance between us and Andromeda, right?
These little specks that you're seeing in here, they're galaxies.
Now we're going to zoom back out,
and you can see this structure that,
when we get very far out, looks very regular,
but it's made up of a lot of irregular variations.
So they're simple building blocks.
There's a very simple fluid to begin with.
It's got dark matter, it's got ordinary matter,
it's got photons and it's got neutrinos,
which don't play much role in the later part of the universe.
And it's just a simple fluid and it, over time,
develops into this complicated structure.
And so you know when you first saw this picture,
it didn't mean quite so much to you.
Here you're looking across one percent of the volume of the visible universe
and you're seeing billions of galaxies, right, and nodes,
but you realize they're not even the main structure.
There's a framework, which is the dark matter, the invisible matter,
that's out there that's actually holding it all together.
So let's fly through it, and you can see how much harder it is
when you're in the middle of something to figure this out.
So here's that same end result.
You see a filament,
you see the light is the invisible matter,
and the yellow is the stars or the galaxies showing up.
And we're going to fly around, and we'll fly around,
and you'll see occasionally a couple of filaments intersect,
and you get a large cluster of galaxies.
And then we'll fly in to where the very large cluster is,
and you can see what it looks like.
And so from inside, it doesn't look very complicated, right?
It's only when you look at it at a very large scale,
and explore it and so forth, you realize it's a very intricate,
complicated kind of a design, right?
And it's grown up in some kind of way.
So the question is,
how hard would it be to assemble this, right?
How big a contractor team would you need
to put this universe together, right?
That's the issue, right?
And so here we are.
You see how the filament --
you see how several filaments are coming together,
therefore making this supercluster of galaxies.
And you have to understand, this is not how it would actually look
if you -- first, you can't travel this fast,
everything would be distorted,
but this is using simple rendering and graphic arts kind of stuff.
This is how, if you took billions of years to go around,
it might look to you, right?
And if you could see invisible matter, too.
And so the idea is, you know, how would you put together the universe
in a very simple way?
We're going to start and realize that the entire visible universe,
everything we can see in every direction with the Hubble Space Telescope
plus our other instruments,
was once in a region that was smaller than an atom.
It started with tiny quantum mechanical fluctuations,
but expanding at a tremendous rate.
And those fluctuations
were stretched to astronomical sizes, and those fluctuations
eventually are the things we see in the cosmic microwave background.
And then we needed some way to turn those fluctuations into galaxies
and clusters of galaxies and make these kinds of structures go on.
So I'm going to show you a smaller simulation.
This simulation was run on 1,000 processors for a month
in order to make just this simple visible one.
So I'm going to show you one
that can be run on a desktop in two days in the next picture.
So you start out with teeny fluctuations
when the universe was at this point,
now four times smaller, and so forth.
And you start seeing these networks, this cosmic web of structure forming.
And this is a simple one, because it doesn't have the ordinary matter
and it just has the dark matter in it.
And you see how the dark matter lumps up,
and the ordinary matter just trails along behind.
So there it is.
At the beginning it's very uniform.
The fluctuations are a part in 100,000.
There are a few peaks that are a part in 10,000,
and then over billions of years, gravity just pulls in.
This is light over density, pulls the material around in.
That pulls in more material and pulls in more material.
But the distances on the universe are so large
and the time scales are so large that it takes a long time for this to form.
And it keeps forming until the universe is roughly about half the size it is now,
in terms of its expansion.
And at that point, the universe mysteriously starts accelerating
its expansion and cuts off the formation of larger-scale structure.
So we're just seeing as large a scale structure as we can see,
and then only things that have started forming already
are going to form, and then from then on it's going to go on.
So we're able to do the simulation, but this is two days on a desktop.
We need, you know, 30 days on 1,000 processors
to do the kind of simulation that I showed you before.
So we have an idea of how to play seriously, creating the universe
by starting with essentially less than an eyedrop full of material,
and we create everything we can see in any direction, right,
from almost nothing -- that is, something extremely tiny,
extremely small -- and it is almost perfect,
except it has these tiny fluctuations at a part in 100,000 level,
which turn out to produce the interesting patterns and designs we see,
that is, galaxies and stars and so forth.
So we have a model, and we can calculate it, and we can use it
to make designs of what we think the universe really looks like.
And that design is sort of way beyond
what our original imagination ever was.
So this is what we started with 15 years ago,
with the Cosmic Background Explorer -- made the map on the upper right,
which basically showed us that there were large-scale fluctuations,
and actually fluctuations on several scales. You can kind of see that.
Since then we've had WMAP,
which just gives us higher angular resolution.
We see the same large-scale structure,
but we see additional small-scale structure.
And on the bottom right is if the satellite had flipped upside down
and mapped the Earth, what kind of a map we would have got of the Earth.
You can see, well, you can, kind of pick out
all the major continents, but that's about it.
But what we're hoping when we get to Planck, we'll have resolution
about equivalent to the resolution you see of the Earth there,
where you can really see the complicated pattern that exists on the Earth.
And you can also tell, because of the sharp edges
and the way things fit together, there are some non-linear processes.
Geology has these effects,
which is moving the plates around and so forth.
You can see that just from the map alone.
We want to get to the point in our maps of the early universe
we can see whether there are any non-linear effects
that are starting to move, to modify, and are giving us a hint about how
space-time itself was actually created at the beginning moments.
So that's where we are today,
and that's what I wanted to give you 
a flavor of.
Give you a different view about what the design
and what everything else looks like.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Good morning.
Let's look for a minute at the greatest icon of all, Leonardo da Vinci.
We're all familiar with his fantastic work --
his drawings, his paintings, his inventions, his writings.
But we do not know his face.
Thousands of books have been written about him,
but there's controversy, and it remains, about his looks.
Even this well-known portrait is not accepted by many art historians.
So, what do you think?
Is this the face of Leonardo da Vinci or isn't it?
Let's find out.
Leonardo was a man that drew everything around him.
He drew people, anatomy, plants, animals, landscapes, buildings, water, everything.
But no faces?
I find that hard to believe.
His contemporaries made faces, like the ones you see here --
en face or three-quarters.
So, surely a passionate drawer like Leonardo
must have made self-portraits from time to time.
So let's try to find them.
I think that if we were to scan all of his work
and look for self-portraits, we would find his face looking at us.
So I looked at all of his drawings, more than 700,
and looked for male portraits.
There are about 120, you see them here.
Which ones of these could be self-portraits?
Well, for that they have to be done as we just saw, en face or three-quarters.
So we can eliminate all the profiles.
It also has to be sufficiently detailed.
So we can also eliminate the ones that are very vague or very stylized.
And we know from his contemporaries
that Leonardo was a very handsome, even beautiful man.
So we can also eliminate the ugly ones or the caricatures.
(Laughter)
And look what happens -- only three candidates remain that fit the bill.
And here they are.
Yes, indeed, the old man is there,
as is this famous pen drawing of the Homo Vitruvianus.
And lastly, the only portrait of a male that Leonardo painted, "The Musician."
Before we go into these faces,
I should explain why I have some right to talk about them.
I've made more than 1,100 portraits myself
for newspapers, over the course of 300 -- 30 years, sorry, 30 years only.
(Laughter)
But there are 1,100, and very few artists have drawn so many faces.
So I know a little about drawing and analyzing faces.
OK, now let's look at these three portraits.
And hold onto your seats, because if we zoom in on those faces,
remark how they have the same broad forehead, the horizontal eyebrows,
the long nose, the curved lips and the small, well-developed chin.
I couldn't believe my eyes when I first saw that.
There is no reason why these portraits should look alike.
All we did was look for portraits that had the characteristics of a self-portrait,
and look, they are very similar.
Now, are they made in the right order?
The young man should be made first.
And as you see here from the years that they were created,
it is indeed the case.
They are made in the right order.
What was the age of Leonardo at the time? Does that fit?
Yes, it does. He was 33, 38 and 63 when these were made.
So we have three pictures, potentially of the same person
of the same age as Leonardo at the time.
But how do we know it's him, and not someone else?
Well, we need a reference.
And here's the only picture of Leonardo that's widely accepted.
It's a statue made by Verrocchio, of David,
for which Leonardo posed as a boy of 15.
And if we now compare the face of the statue,
with the face of the musician, you see the very same features again.
The statue is the reference, and it connects the identity of Leonardo
to those three faces.
Ladies and gentlemen, this story has not yet been published.
It's only proper that you here at TED hear and see it first.
The icon of icons finally has a face.
Here he is: Leonardo da Vinci.
(Applause)
These are some photos of me
volunteering in a Cambodian orphanage
in 2006.
When these photos were taken,
I thought I was doing a really good thing
and that I was really helping those kids.
I had a lot to learn.
It all started for me
when I was 19 years old
and went backpacking
through Southeast Asia.
When I reached Cambodia,
I felt uncomfortable being on holiday
surrounded by so much poverty
and wanted to do something to give back.
So I visited some orphanages
and donated some clothes and books
and some money
to help the kids that I met.
But one of the orphanages I visited
was desperately poor.
I had never encountered poverty
like that before in my life.
They didn't have funds for enough food,
clean water
or medical treatment,
and the sad little faces on those kids
were heartbreaking.
So I was compelled
to do something more to help.
I fund-raised in Australia and returned
to Cambodia the following year
to volunteer at the orphanage
for a few months.
I taught English and bought
water filters and food
and took all of the kids to the dentist
for the first time in their lives.
But over the course of the next year,
I came to discover that this orphanage
that I had been supporting
was terribly corrupt.
The director had been embezzling
every cent donated to the orphanage,
and in my absence, the children
were suffering such gross neglect
that they were forced to catch mice
to feed themselves.
I also found out later
that the director had been physically
and sexually abusing the kids.
I couldn't bring myself
to turn my back on children
who I had come to know and care about
and return to my life in Australia.
So I worked with a local team
and the local authorities
to set up a new orphanage
and rescue the kids
to give them a safe new home.
But this is where my story takes
another unexpected turn.
As I adjusted to my new life
running an orphanage in Cambodia,
(Khmer) I learned
to speak Khmer fluently,
which means that I learned
to speak the Khmer language fluently.
And when I could communicate
properly with the kids,
I began to uncover some strange things.
Most of the children we had removed
from the orphanage
were not, in fact, orphans at all.
They had parents,
and the few that were orphaned
had other living relatives,
like grandparents and aunties and uncles
and other siblings.
So why were these children
living in an orphanage
when they weren't orphans?
Since 2005, the number
of orphanages in Cambodia
has risen by 75 percent,
and the number of children
living in Cambodian orphanages
has nearly doubled,
despite the fact
that the vast majority of children
living in these orphanages
are not orphans in the traditional sense.
They're children from poor families.
So if the vast majority of children
living in orphanages
are not orphans,
then the term "orphanage"
is really just a euphemistic name
for a residential care institution.
These institutions go
by other names as well,
like "shelters," "safe houses,"
"children's homes," "children's villages,"
even "boarding schools."
And this problem is not just
confined to Cambodia.
This map shows some of the countries
that have seen a dramatic increase
in the numbers of residential
care institutions
and the numbers of children
being institutionalized.
In Uganda, for example,
the number of children
living in institutions
has increased by more than
1,600 percent since 1992.
And the problems posed
by putting kids into institutions
don't just pertain to the corrupt
and abusive institutions
like the one that I rescued the kids from.
The problems are with all forms
of residential care.
Over 60 years of international
research has shown us
that children who grow up in institutions,
even the very best institutions,
are at serious risk
of developing mental illnesses,
attachment disorders,
growth and speech delays,
and many will struggle
with an inability to reintegrate
back into society later in life
and form healthy relationships as adults.
These kids grow up
without any model of family
or of what good parenting looks like,
so they then can struggle
to parent their own children.
So if you institutionalize
large numbers of children,
it will affect not only this generation,
but also the generations to come.
We've learned these lessons
before in Australia.
It's what happened
to our "Stolen Generations,"
the indigenous children
who were removed from their families
with the belief
that we could do a better job
of raising their children.
Just imagine for a moment
what residential care
would be like for a child.
Firstly, you have a constant
rotation of caregivers,
with somebody new coming on
to the shift every eight hours.
And then on top of that
you have a steady stream of visitors
and volunteers coming in,
showering you in the love
and affection you're craving
and then leaving again,
evoking all of those feelings
of abandonment,
and proving again and again
that you are not worthy of being loved.
We don't have orphanages
in Australia, the USA, the UK anymore,
and for a very good reason:
one study has shown that young adults
raised in institutions
are 10 times more likely
to fall into sex work than their peers,
40 times more likely
to have a criminal record,
and 500 times more likely
to take their own lives.
There are an estimated
eight million children around the world
living in institutions like orphanages,
despite the fact that around
80 percent of them are not orphans.
Most have families
who could be caring for them
if they had the right support.
But for me,
the most shocking thing of all to realize
is what's contributing to this boom
in the unnecessary institutionalization
of so many children:
it's us --
the tourists, the volunteers
and the donors.
It's the well-meaning support
from people like me back in 2006,
who visit these children
and volunteer and donate,
who are unwittingly fueling an industry
that exploits children
and tears families apart.
It's really no coincidence
that these institutions are largely set up
in areas where tourists
can most easily be lured in
to visit and volunteer
in exchange for donations.
Of the 600 so-called orphanages in Nepal,
over 90 percent of them are located
in the most popular tourist hotspots.
The cold, hard truth is,
the more money that floods in
in support of these institutions,
the more institutions open
and the more children
are removed from their families
to fill their beds.
It's just the laws of supply and demand.
I had to learn all of these
lessons the hard way,
after I had already set up
an orphanage in Cambodia.
I had to eat a big piece
of humble pie to admit
that I had made a mistake
and inadvertently become
a part of the problem.
I had been an orphanage tourist,
a voluntourist.
I then set up my own orphanage
and facilitated orphanage tourism
in order to generate funds
for my orphanage,
before I knew better.
What I came to learn
is that no matter how good
my orphanage was,
it was never going to give those kids
what they really needed:
their families.
I know that it can feel
incredibly depressing
to learn that helping vulnerable children
and overcoming poverty
is not as simple as we've all
been led to believe it should be.
But thankfully, there is a solution.
These problems are reversible
and preventable,
and when we know better,
we can do better.
The organization that I run today,
the Cambodian Children's Trust,
is no longer an orphanage.
In 2012, we changed the model
in favor of family-based care.
I now lead an amazing team
of Cambodian social workers,
nurses and teachers.
Together, we work within communities
to untangle a complex web of social issues
and help Cambodian
families escape poverty.
Our primary focus is on preventing
some of the most vulnerable families
in our community
from being separated in the first place.
But in cases where it's not possible
for a child to live
with its biological family,
we support them in foster care.
Family-based care is always better
than placing a child in an institution.
Do you remember that first photo
that I showed you before?
See that girl who is just about
to catch the ball?
Her name is Torn
She's a strong, brave
and fiercely intelligent girl.
But in 2006, when I first met her
living in that corrupt
and abusive orphanage,
she had never been to school.
She was suffering terrible neglect,
and she yearned desperately
for the warmth and love of her mother.
But this is a photo of Torn today
with her family.
Her mother now has a secure job,
her siblings are doing well in high school
and she is just about to finish
her nursing degree at university.
For Torn's family --
(Applause)
for Torn's family,
the cycle of poverty has been broken.
The family-based care model
that we have developed at CCT
has been so successful,
that it's now being put forward
by UNICEF Cambodia
and the Cambodian government
as a national solution
to keep children in families.
And one of the best --
(Applause)
And one of the best ways
that you can help to solve this problem
is by giving these eight million
children a voice
and become an advocate
for family-based care.
If we work together to raise awareness,
we can make sure the world knows
that we need to put an end
to the unnecessary institutionalization
of vulnerable children.
How do we achieve that?
By redirecting our support
and our donations
away from orphanages
and residential care institutions
towards organizations that are committed
to keeping children in families.
I believe we can make this happen
in our lifetime,
and as a result, we will see
developing communities thrive
and ensure that vulnerable
children everywhere
have what all children need and deserve:
a family.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Six thousand miles of road,
600 miles of subway track,
400 miles of bike lanes
and a half a mile of tram track,
if you've ever been to Roosevelt Island.
These are the numbers that make up
the infrastructure of New York City.
These are the statistics
of our infrastructure.
They're the kind of numbers you can find
released in reports by city agencies.
For example, the Department
of Transportation will probably tell you
how many miles of road they maintain.
The MTA will boast how many miles
of subway track there are.
Most city agencies give us statistics.
This is from a report this year
from the Taxi and Limousine Commission,
where we learn that there's about
13,500 taxis here in New York City.
Pretty interesting, right?
But did you ever think about
where these numbers came from?
Because for these numbers to exist,
someone at the city agency
had to stop and say, hmm, here's a number
that somebody might want want to know.
Here's a number 
that our citizens want to know.
So they go back to their raw data,
they count, they add, they calculate,
and then they put out reports,
and those reports
will have numbers like this.
The problem is, how do they know
all of our questions?
We have lots of questions.
In fact, in some ways there's literally
an infinite number of questions
that we can ask about our city.
The agencies can never keep up.
So the paradigm isn't exactly working,
and I think our policymakers realize that,
because in 2012, Mayor Bloomberg
signed into law what he called
the most ambitious and comprehensive
open data legislation in the country.
In a lot of ways, he's right.
In the last two years, 
the city has released 1,000 datasets
on our open data portal,
and it's pretty awesome.
So you go and look at data like this,
and instead of just counting
the number of cabs,
we can start to ask different questions.
So I had a question.
When's rush hour in New York City?
It can be pretty bothersome.
When is rush hour exactly?
And I thought to myself,
these cabs aren't just numbers,
these are GPS recorders
driving around in our city streets
recording each and every ride they take.
There's data there,
and I looked at that data,
and I made a plot of the average speed of
taxis in New York City throughout the day.
You can see that from about midnight
to around 5:18 in the morning,
speed increases, and at that point,
things turn around,
and they get slower and slower and slower
until about 8:35 in the morning,
when they end up at around
11 and a half miles per hour.
The average taxi is going 11 and a half
miles per hour on our city streets,
and it turns out it stays that way
for the entire day.
(Laughter)
So I said to myself, I guess
there's no rush hour in New York City.
There's just a rush day.
Makes sense. And this is important
for a couple of reasons.
If you're a transportation planner,
this might be pretty interesting to know.
But if you want to get somewhere quickly,
you now know to set your alarm for
4:45 in the morning and you're all set.
New York, right?
But there's a story behind this data.
This data wasn't
just available, it turns out.
It actually came from something called
a Freedom of Information Law Request,
or a FOIL Request.
This is a form you can find on the
Taxi and Limousine Commission website.
In order to access this data,
you need to go get this form,
fill it out, and they will notify you,
and a guy named Chris Whong
did exactly that.
Chris went down, and they told him,
"Just bring a brand new hard drive 
down to our office,
leave it here for five hours,
we'll copy the data and you take it back."
And that's where this data came from.
Now, Chris is the kind of guy
who wants to make the data public,
and so it ended up online for all to use,
and that's where this graph came from.
And the fact that it exists is amazing.
These GPS recorders -- really cool.
But the fact that we have citizens
walking around with hard drives
picking up data from city agencies
to make it public --
it was already kind of public,
you could get to it,
but it was "public," it wasn't public.
And we can do better than that as a city.
We don't need our citizens
walking around with hard drives.
Now, not every dataset
is behind a FOIL Request.
Here is a map I made with the most
dangerous intersections in New York City
based on cyclist accidents.
So the red areas are more dangerous.
And what it shows is first
the East side of Manhattan,
especially in the lower area of Manhattan,
has more cyclist accidents.
That might make sense
because there are more cyclists
coming off the bridges there.
But there's other hotspots worth studying.
There's Williamsburg.
There's Roosevelt Avenue in Queens.
And this is exactly the kind of data
we need for Vision Zero.
This is exactly what we're looking for.
But there's a story
behind this data as well.
This data didn't just appear.
How many of you guys know this logo?
Yeah, I see some shakes.
Have you ever tried to copy
and paste data out of a PDF
and make sense of it?
I see more shakes.
More of you tried copying and pasting
than knew the logo. I like that.
So what happened is, the data
that you just saw was actually on a PDF.
In fact, hundreds and hundreds
and hundreds of pages of PDF
put out by our very own NYPD,
and in order to access it,
you would either have to copy and paste
for hundreds and hundreds of hours,
or you could be John Krauss.
John Krauss was like,
I'm not going to copy and paste this data.
I'm going to write a program.
It's called the NYPD Crash Data Band-Aid,
and it goes to the NYPD's website
and it would download PDFs.
Every day it would search;
if it found a PDF, it would download it
and then it would run
some PDF-scraping program,
and out would come the text,
and it would go on the Internet,
and then people could make maps like that.
And the fact that the data's here,
the fact that we have access to it --
Every accident, by the way,
is a row in this table.
You can imagine how many PDFs that is.
The fact that we
have access to that is great,
but let's not release it in PDF form,
because then we're having our citizens
write PDF scrapers.
It's not the best use
of our citizens' time,
and we as a city can do better than that.
Now, the good news is that
the de Blasio administration
actually recently released this data
a few months ago,
and so now we can
actually have access to it,
but there's a lot of data
still entombed in PDF.
For example, our crime data
is still only available in PDF.
And not just our crime data,
our own city budget.
Our city budget is only readable
right now in PDF form.
And it's not just us
that can't analyze it --
our own legislators
who vote for the budget
also only get it in PDF.
So our legislators cannot analyze 
the budget that they are voting for.
And I think as a city we can do
a little better than that as well.
Now, there's a lot of data
that's not hidden in PDFs.
This is an example of a map I made,
and this is the dirtiest waterways
in New York City.
Now, how do I measure dirty?
Well, it's kind of a little weird,
but I looked at the level
of fecal coliform,
which is a measurement of fecal matter
in each of our waterways.
The larger the circle,
the dirtier the water,
so the large circles are dirty water,
the small circles are cleaner.
What you see is inland waterways.
This is all data that was sampled
by the city over the last five years.
And inland waterways are,
in general, dirtier.
That makes sense, right?
And the bigger circles are dirty.
And I learned a few things from this.
Number one: Never swim in anything
that ends in "creek" or "canal."
But number two: I also found
the dirtiest waterway in New York City,
by this measure, one measure.
In Coney Island Creek, which is not
the Coney Island you swim in, luckily.
It's on the other side.
But Coney Island Creek, 94 percent
of samples taken over the last five years
have had fecal levels so high
that it would be against state law
to swim in the water.
And this is not the kind of fact
that you're going to see
boasted in a city report, right?
It's not going to be 
the front page on nyc.gov.
You're not going to see it there,
but the fact that we can get 
to that data is awesome.
But once again, it wasn't super easy,
because this data was not
on the open data portal.
If you were to go to the open data portal,
you'd see just a snippet of it, 
a year or a few months.
It was actually on the Department
of Environmental Protection's website.
And each one of these links is an Excel 
sheet, and each Excel sheet is different.
Every heading is different:
you copy, paste, reorganize.
When you do you can make maps
and that's great, but once again,
we can do better than that 
as a city, we can normalize things.
And we're getting there, because
there's this website that Socrata makes
called the Open Data Portal NYC.
This is where 1,100 data sets 
that don't suffer
from the things I just told you live,
and that number is growing,
and that's great.
You can download data in any format,
be it CSV or PDF or Excel document.
Whatever you want,
you can download the data that way.
The problem is, once you do,
you will find that each agency
codes their addresses differently.
So one is street name, 
intersection street,
street, borough, address, building,
building address.
So once again, you're spending time,
even when we have this portal,
you're spending time
normalizing our address fields.
And that's not the best use 
of our citizens' time.
We can do better than that as a city.
We can standardize our addresses,
and if we do, 
we can get more maps like this.
This is a map of fire hydrants
in New York City,
but not just any fire hydrants.
These are the top 250 grossing fire
hydrants in terms of parking tickets.
(Laughter)
So I learned a few things from this map,
and I really like this map.
Number one, just don't park
on the Upper East Side.
Just don't. It doesn't matter where
you park, you will get a hydrant ticket.
Number two, I found the two highest
grossing hydrants in all of New York City,
and they're on the Lower East Side,
and they were bringing in over
55,000 dollars a year in parking tickets.
And that seemed a little strange
to me when I noticed it,
so I did a little digging and it turns out
what you had is a hydrant
and then something called
a curb extension,
which is like a seven-foot
space to walk on,
and then a parking spot.
And so these cars came along,
and the hydrant --
"It's all the way over there, I'm fine,"
and there was actually a parking spot
painted there beautifully for them.
They would park there, and the NYPD
disagreed with this designation
and would ticket them.
And it wasn't just me 
who found a parking ticket.
This is the Google 
Street View car driving by
finding the same parking ticket.
So I wrote about this on my blog,
on I Quant NY, and the DOT responded,
and they said,
"While the DOT has not received
any complaints about this location,
we will review the roadway markings
and make any appropriate alterations."
And I thought to myself,
typical government response,
all right, moved on with my life.
But then, a few weeks later,
something incredible happened.
They repainted the spot,
and for a second I thought I saw
the future of open data,
because think about what happened here.
For five years, this spot was being 
ticketed, and it was confusing,
and then a citizen found something,
they told the city, and within a few weeks
the problem was fixed.
It's amazing. And a lot of people
see open data as being a watchdog.
It's not, it's about being a partner.
We can empower our citizens
to be better partners for government,
and it's not that hard.
All we need are a few changes.
If you're FOILing data,
if you're seeing your data 
being FOILed over and over again,
let's release it to the public, that's
a sign that it should be made public.
And if you're a government agency
releasing a PDF,
let's pass legislation that requires you
to post it with the underlying data,
because that data
is coming from somewhere.
I don't know where, but it's
coming from somewhere,
and you can release it with the PDF.
And let's adopt and share
some open data standards.
Let's start with our addresses
here in New York City.
Let's just start
normalizing our addresses.
Because New York is a leader in open data.
Despite all this, we are absolutely
a leader in open data,
and if we start normalizing things,
and set an open data standard,
others will follow. The state will follow,
and maybe the federal government,
Other countries could follow,
and we're not that far off from a time
where you could write one program
and map information from 100 countries.
It's not science fiction.
We're actually quite close.
And by the way, who are we
empowering with this?
Because it's not just John Krauss
and it's not just Chris Whong.
There are hundreds of meetups
going on in New York City right now,
active meetups.
There are thousands of people
attending these meetups.
These people are going after work
and on weekends,
and they're attending these meetups
to look at open data
and make our city a better place.
Groups like BetaNYC, who just last week 
released something called citygram.nyc
that allows you to subscribe
to 311 complaints
around your own home,
or around your office.
You put in your address,
you get local complaints.
And it's not just the tech community
that are after these things.
It's urban planners like 
the students I teach at Pratt.
It's policy advocates, it's everyone,
it's citizens from a diverse
set of backgrounds.
And with some small, incremental changes,
we can unlock the passion
and the ability of our citizens
to harness open data
and make our city even better,
whether it's one dataset,
or one parking spot at a time.
Thank you.
(Applause)
I love the Internet.
It's true.
Think about everything it has brought us.
Think about all the services we use,
all the connectivity,
all the entertainment,
all the business, all the commerce.
And it's happening during our lifetimes.
I'm pretty sure that one day
we'll be writing history books
hundreds of years from now. This time
our generation will be remembered
as the generation that got online,
the generation
that built something really and truly global.
But yes, it's also true
that the Internet has problems, very serious problems,
problems with security
and problems with privacy.
I've spent my career
fighting these problems.
So let me show you something.
This here
is Brain.
This is a floppy disk
-- five and a quarter-inch floppy disk
infected by Brain.A.
It's the first virus we ever found
for PC computers.
And we actually know
where Brain came from.
We know because it says so
inside the code.
Let's take a look.
All right.
That's the boot sector of an infected floppy,
and if we take a closer look inside,
we'll see that right there,
it says, "Welcome to the dungeon."
And then it continues,
saying, 1986, Basit and Amjad.
And Basit and Amjad are first names,
Pakistani first names.
In fact, there's a phone number and an address in Pakistan.
(Laughter)
Now, 1986.
Now it's 2011.
That's 25 years ago.
The PC virus problem is 25 years old now.
So half a year ago,
I decided to go to Pakistan myself.
So let's see, here's a couple of photos I took while I was in Pakistan.
This is from the city of Lahore,
which is around 300 kilometers south
from Abbottabad, where Bin Laden was caught.
Here's a typical street view.
And here's the street or road leading to this building,
which is 730 Nizam block at Allama Iqbal Town.
And I knocked on the door.
(Laughter)
You want to guess who opened the door?
Basit and Amjad; they are still there.
(Laughter)
(Applause)
So here standing up is Basit.
Sitting down is his brother Amjad.
These are the guys who wrote the first PC virus.
Now of course, we had a very interesting discussion.
I asked them why.
I asked them how they feel about what they started.
And I got some sort of satisfaction
from learning that both Basit and Amjad
had had their computers infected dozens of times
by completely unrelated other viruses
over these years.
So there is some sort of justice
in the world after all.
Now, the viruses that we used to see
in the 1980s and 1990s
obviously are not a problem any more.
So let me just show you a couple of examples
of what they used to look like.
What I'm running here
is a system that enables me
to run age-old programs on a modern computer.
So let me just mount some drives. Go over there.
What we have here is a list of old viruses.
So let me just run some viruses on my computer.
For example,
let's go with the Centipede virus first.
And you can see at the top of the screen,
there's a centipede scrolling across your computer
when you get infected by this one.
You know that you're infected
because it actually shows up.
Here's another one. This is the virus called Crash,
invented in Russia in 1992.
Let me show you one which actually makes some sound.
(Siren noise)
And the last example,
guess what the Walker virus does?
Yes, there's a guy walking across your screen
once you get infected.
So it used to be fairly easy to know
that you're infected by a virus,
when the viruses were written by hobbyists
and teenagers.
Today, they are no longer being written
by hobbyists and teenagers.
Today, viruses are a global problem.
What we have here in the background
is an example of our systems that we run in our labs,
where we track virus infections worldwide.
So we can actually see in real time
that we've just blocked viruses in Sweden and Taiwan
and Russia and elsewhere.
In fact, if I just connect back to our lab systems
through the Web,
we can see in real time
just some kind of idea of how many viruses,
how many new examples of malware we find every single day.
Here's the latest virus we've found,
in a file called Server.exe.
And we found it right over here three seconds ago --
the previous one, six seconds ago.
And if we just scroll around,
it's just massive.
We find tens of thousands, even hundreds of thousands.
And that's the last 20 minutes of malware
every single day.
So where are all these coming from then?
Well today, it's the organized criminal gangs
writing these viruses
because they make money with their viruses.
It's gangs like --
let's go to GangstaBucks.com.
This is a website operating in Moscow
where these guys are buying infected computers.
So if you are a virus writer
and you're capable of infecting Windows computers,
but you don't know what to do with them,
you can sell those infected computers --
somebody else's computers -- to these guys.
And they'll actually pay you money for those computers.
So how do these guys then monetize
those infected computers?
Well there's multiple different ways,
such as banking trojans, which will steal money from your online banking accounts
when you do online banking,
or keyloggers.
Keyloggers silently sit on your computer, hidden from view,
and they record everything you type.
So you're sitting on your computer and you're doing Google searches.
Every single Google search you type
is saved and sent to the criminals.
Every single email you write is saved and sent to the criminals.
Same thing with every single password and so on.
But the thing that they're actually looking for most
are sessions where you go online
and do online purchases in any online store.
Because when you do purchases in online stores,
you will be typing in your name, the delivery address,
your credit card number and the credit card security codes.
And here's an example of a file
we found from a server a couple of weeks ago.
That's the credit card number,
that's the expiration date, that's the security code,
and that's the name of the owner of the card.
Once you gain access to other people's credit card information,
you can just go online and buy whatever you want
with this information.
And that, obviously, is a problem.
We now have a whole underground marketplace
and business ecosystem
built around online crime.
One example of how these guys
actually are capable of monetizing their operations:
we go and have a look at the pages of INTERPOL
and search for wanted persons.
We find guys like Bjorn Sundin, originally from Sweden,
and his partner in crime,
also listed on the INTERPOL wanted pages,
Mr. Shaileshkumar Jain,
a U.S. citizen.
These guys were running an operation called I.M.U.,
a cybercrime operation through which they netted millions.
They are both right now on the run.
Nobody knows where they are.
U.S. officials, just a couple of weeks ago,
froze a Swiss bank account
belonging to Mr. Jain,
and that bank account had 14.9 million U.S. dollars on it.
So the amount of money online crime generates
is significant.
And that means that the online criminals
can actually afford to invest into their attacks.
We know that online criminals
are hiring programmers, hiring testing people,
testing their code,
having back-end systems with SQL databases.
And they can afford to watch how we work --
like how security people work --
and try to work their way around
any security precautions we can build.
They also use the global nature of Internet
to their advantage.
I mean, the Internet is international.
That's why we call it the Internet.
And if you just go and take a look
at what's happening in the online world,
here's a video built by Clarified Networks,
which illustrates how one single malware family is able to move around the world.
This operation, believed to be originally from Estonia,
moves around from one country to another
as soon as the website is tried to shut down.
So you just can't shut these guys down.
They will switch from one country to another,
from one jurisdiction to another --
moving around the world,
using the fact that we don't have the capability
to globally police operations like this.
So the Internet is as if
someone would have given free plane tickets
to all the online criminals of the world.
Now, criminals who weren't capable of reaching us before
can reach us.
So how do you actually go around finding online criminals?
How do you actually track them down?
Let me give you an example.
What we have here is one exploit file.
Here, I'm looking at the Hex dump of an image file,
which contains an exploit.
And that basically means, if you're trying to view this image file on your Windows computer,
it actually takes over your computer and runs code.
Now, if you'll take a look at this image file --
well there's the image header,
and there the actual code of the attack starts.
And that code has been encrypted,
so let's decrypt it.
It has been encrypted with XOR function 97.
You just have to believe me,
it is, it is.
And we can go here
and actually start decrypting it.
Well the yellow part of the code is now decrypted.
And I know, it doesn't really look much different from the original.
But just keep staring at it.
You'll actually see that down here
you can see a Web address:
unionseek.com/d/ioo.exe
And when you view this image on your computer
it actually is going to download and run that program.
And that's a backdoor which will take over your computer.
But even more interestingly,
if we continue decrypting,
we'll find this mysterious string,
which says O600KO78RUS.
That code is there underneath the encryption
as some sort of a signature.
It's not used for anything.
And I was looking at that, trying to figure out what it means.
So obviously I Googled for it.
I got zero hits; wasn't there.
So I spoke with the guys at the lab.
And we have a couple of Russian guys in our labs,
and one of them mentioned,
well, it ends in RUS like Russia.
And 78 is the city code
for the city of St. Petersburg.
For example, you can find it from some phone numbers
and car license plates and stuff like that.
So I went looking for contacts in St. Petersburg,
and through a long road,
we eventually found this one particular website.
Here's this Russian guy who's been operating online for a number of years
who runs his own website,
and he runs a blog under the popular Live Journal.
And on this blog, he blogs about his life,
about his life in St. Petersburg --
he's in his early 20s --
about his cat,
about his girlfriend.
And he drives a very nice car.
In fact, this guy drives
a Mercedes-Benz S600
V12
with a six-liter engine
with more than 400 horsepower.
Now that's a nice car for a 20-something year-old kid in St. Petersburg.
How do I know about this car?
Because he blogged about the car.
He actually had a car accident.
In downtown St. Petersburg,
he actually crashed his car into another car.
And he put blogged images about the car accident --
that's his Mercedes --
right here is the Lada Samara he crashed into.
And you can actually see that the license plate of the Samara
ends in 78RUS.
And if you actually take a look at the scene picture,
you can see that the plate of the Mercedes
is O600KO78RUS.
Now I'm not a lawyer,
but if I would be,
this is where I would say, "I rest my case."
(Laughter)
So what happens when online criminals are caught?
Well in most cases it never gets this far.
The vast majority of the online crime cases,
we don't even know which continent the attacks are coming from.
And even if we are able to find online criminals,
quite often there is no outcome.
The local police don't act, or if they do, there's not enough evidence,
or for some reason we can't take them down.
I wish it would be easier;
unfortunately it isn't.
But things are also changing
at a very rapid pace.
You've all heard about things like Stuxnet.
So if you look at what Stuxnet did
is that it infected these.
That's a Siemens S7-400 PLC,
programmable logic [controller].
And this is what runs our infrastructure.
This is what runs everything around us.
PLC's, these small boxes which have no display,
no keyboard,
which are programmed, are put in place, and they do their job.
For example, the elevators in this building
most likely are controlled by one of these.
And when Stuxnet infects one of these,
that's a massive revolution
on the kinds of risks we have to worry about.
Because everything around us is being run by these.
I mean, we have critical infrastructure.
You go to any factory, any power plant,
any chemical plant, any food processing plant,
you look around --
everything is being run by computers.
Everything is being run by computers.
Everything is reliant on these computers working.
We have become very reliant
on Internet,
on basic things like electricity, obviously,
on computers working.
And this really is something
which creates completely new problems for us.
We must have some way
of continuing to work
even if computers fail.
(Laughter)
(Applause)
So preparedness means that we can do stuff
even when the things we take for granted
aren't there.
It's actually very basic stuff --
thinking about continuity, thinking about backups,
thinking about the things that actually matter.
Now I told you --
(Laughter)
I love the Internet. I do.
Think about all the services we have online.
Think about if they are taken away from you,
if one day you don't actually have them
for some reason or another.
I see beauty in the future of the Internet,
but I'm worried
that we might not see that.
I'm worried that we are running into problems
because of online crime.
Online crime is the one thing
that might take these things away from us.
(Laughter)
I've spent my life
defending the Net,
and I do feel that if we don't fight online crime,
we are running a risk of losing it all.
We have to do this globally,
and we have to do it right now.
What we need
is more global, international law enforcement work
to find online criminal gangs --
these organized gangs
that are making millions out of their attacks.
That's much more important
than running anti-viruses or running firewalls.
What actually matters
is actually finding the people behind these attacks,
and even more importantly,
we have to find the people
who are about to become
part of this online world of crime,
but haven't yet done it.
We have to find the people with the skills,
but without the opportunities
and give them the opportunities
to use their skills for good.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
I'm five years old, and I am very proud.
My father has just built the best outhouse
in our little village in Ukraine.
Inside, it's a smelly,
gaping hole in the ground,
but outside, it's pearly white formica
and it literally gleams in the sun.
This makes me feel so proud, so important,
that I appoint myself the leader
of my little group of friends
and I devise missions for us.
So we prowl from house to house
looking for flies captured in spider webs
and we set them free.
Four years earlier, when I was one,
after the Chernobyl accident,
the rain came down black,
and my sister's hair fell out in clumps,
and I spent nine months in the hospital.
There were no visitors allowed,
so my mother bribed a hospital worker.
She acquired a nurse's uniform,
and she snuck in every night
to sit by my side.
Five years later,
an unexpected silver lining.
Thanks to Chernobyl,
we get asylum in the U.S.
I am six years old, and I don't
cry when we leave home
and we come to America,
because I expect it to be
a place filled with rare
and wonderful things
like bananas and chocolate
and Bazooka bubble gum,
Bazooka bubble gum
with the little cartoon wrappers inside,
Bazooka that we'd get
once a year in Ukraine
and we'd have to chew
one piece for an entire week.
So the first day we get to New York,
my grandmother and I find a penny
in the floor of the homeless shelter
that my family's staying in.
Only, we don't know
that it's a homeless shelter.
We think that it's a hotel,
a hotel with lots of rats.
So we find this penny kind
of fossilized in the floor,
and we think that a very wealthy
man must have left it there
because regular people
don't just lose money.
And I hold this penny
in the palm of my hand,
and it's sticky and rusty,
but it feels like I'm holding a fortune.
I decide that I'm going
to get my very own piece
of Bazooka bubble gum.
And in that moment, I feel
like a millionaire.
About a year later, I get
to feel that way again
when we find a bag full
of stuffed animals in the trash,
and suddenly I have more toys
than I've ever had in my whole life.
And again, I get that feeling
when we get a knock
on the door of our apartment in Brooklyn,
and my sister and I find a deliveryman
with a box of pizza that we didn't order.
So we take the pizza,
our very first pizza,
and we devour slice after slice
as the deliveryman stands there
and stares at us from the doorway.
And he tells us to pay,
but we don't speak English.
My mother comes out,
and he asks her for money,
but she doesn't have enough.
She walks 50 blocks
to and from work every day
just to avoid spending money on bus fare.
Then our neighbor pops her head in,
and she turns red with rage
when she realizes
that those immigrants from downstairs
have somehow gotten
their hands on her pizza.
Everyone's upset.
But the pizza is delicious.
It doesn't hit me until years
later just how little we had.
On our 10 year anniversary
of being in the U.S.,
we decided to celebrate
by reserving a room
at the hotel that we first stayed
in when we got to the U.S.
The man at the front desk
laughs, and he says,
"You can't reserve a room here.
This is a homeless shelter."
And we were shocked.
My husband Brian was also
homeless as a kid.
His family lost everything, and at age 11,
he had to live in motels with his dad,
motels
that would round up all of their food
and keep it hostage until they were
able to pay the bill.
And one time, when he finally got his box
of Frosted Flakes back, it
was crawling with roaches.
But he did have one thing.
He had this shoebox that he carried
with him everywhere
containing nine comic books,
two G.I. Joes painted
to look like Spider-Man
and five Gobots. And
this was his treasure.
This was his own assembly of heroes
that kept him from drugs and gangs
and from giving up on his dreams.
I'm going to tell you about one more
formerly homeless member of our family.
This is Scarlett.
Once upon a time, Scarlet
was used as bait in dog fights.
She was tied up and thrown into the ring
for other dogs to attack so they'd get
more aggressive before the fight.
And now, these days, she eats organic food
and she sleeps on an orthopedic
bed with her name on it,
but when we pour water
for her in her bowl,
she still looks up and she wags
her tail in gratitude.
Sometimes Brian and I walk
through the park with Scarlett,
and she rolls through the grass,
and we just look at her
and then we look at each other
and we feel gratitude.
We forget about all of our new
middle-class frustrations
and disappointments,
and we feel like millionaires.
Thank you.
(Applause)
I would be willing to bet
I'm the dumbest guy in the room,
because I couldn't get through school;
I struggled with school.
But I knew at a very early age
that I loved money, I loved business
and I loved this entrepreneurial thing.
I was raised to be an entrepreneur.
What I've been really
passionate about ever since --
and I've never spoken
about this ever, until now --
so this is the first time
anyone's heard it,
except my wife, three days ago.
She said, "What are you talking about?"
I told her that I think
we miss an opportunity
to find these kids
who have the entrepreneurial traits,
and to groom them or show them
that being an entrepreneur
is actually a cool thing.
It's not something
that is a bad thing and is vilified,
which is what happens in a lot of society.
Kids, when we grow up, have dreams,
and we have passions, and we have visions,
and somehow we get those things crushed.
We get told that we need to study harder
or be more focused or get a tutor.
My parents got me a tutor in French,
and I still suck in French.
Two years ago,
I was the highest-rated lecturer
at MIT's Entrepreneurial Master's Program.
It was a speaking event
in front of groups of entrepreneurs
from around the world.
When I was in grade two,
I won a citywide speaking competition,
but nobody had ever said,
"Hey, this kid's a good speaker.
He can't focus, but he loves walking
around and getting people energized."
No one said, "Get him
a coach in speaking."
They said, get me a tutor
in what I suck at.
So as kids show these traits --
and we need to start looking for them --
I think we should be raising kids
to be entrepreneurs instead of lawyers.
Unfortunately, the school system
is grooming this world to say,
"Let's be a lawyer,"
or, "Let's be a doctor."
We're missing that opportunity,
because no one ever says,
"Hey, be an entrepreneur."
Entrepreneurs are people --
we have a lot of them in this room --
who have ideas and passions
or see these needs in the world
and decide to stand up and do it.
And we put everything on the line
to make that stuff happen.
We have the ability
to get the groups of people around us
that want to build that dream with us.
And I think if we could get kids
to embrace the idea at a young age,
of being entrepreneurial,
we could change everything
in the world that's a problem today.
Every problem out there,
somebody has the idea for.
And as a young kid,
nobody can say it can't happen,
because you're too dumb to realize
that you couldn't figure it out.
I think we have an obligation
as parents and a society
to start teaching our kids to fish
instead of giving them the fish --
the old parable: "Give a man
a fish, you feed him for a day.
Teach a man to fish,
you feed him for a lifetime."
If we can teach our kids
to be entrepreneurial,
the ones that show the traits to be,
like we teach the ones who have
science gifts to go on in science,
what if we saw the ones
with entrepreneurial traits
and taught them to be entrepreneurs?
We could have these kids
spreading businesses
instead of waiting
for government handouts.
What we do is teach our kids
the things they shouldn't do:
don't hit; don't bite; don't swear.
Right now we teach our kids
to go after really good jobs;
the school system teaches them
to go after things like
being a doctor and being a lawyer
and being an accountant and a dentist
and a teacher and a pilot.
And the media says it's really cool
if we could go out
and be a model or a singer
or a sports hero like Luongo or Crosby.
Our MBA programs do not teach kids
to be entrepreneurs.
The reason I avoided an MBA program,
other than that I didn't get into any,
since I had a 61 percent
average out of high school,
then a 61 percent average
at the only school in Canada
that accepted me, Carlton,
is that our MBA programs don't teach
kids to be entrepreneurs.
They teach them to work in corporations.
So who's starting these companies?
It's these random few people.
Even in popular literature,
the only book I've ever found --
and this should be
on all your reading lists --
the only book I've ever found
that makes the entrepreneur
a hero is "Atlas Shrugged."
Everything else in the world
looks at entrepreneurs
and says we're bad people.
I look at even my family.
Both my grandfathers and my dad
were entrepreneurs.
My brother, sister and I,
all three of us own companies as well.
We all decided to start these things
because it's the only place we fit.
We didn't fit in normal work;
we couldn't work for somebody else,
we're stubborn and we have
all these other traits.
But kids could be entrepreneurs as well.
I'm a big part of a couple organizations
called the Entrepreneurs' Organization
and the Young Presidents' Organization.
I just came back from speaking
in Barcelona at the YPO global conference.
And everyone I met over there
who's an entrepreneur
struggled with school.
I have 18 out of the 19 signs
of attention deficit disorder diagnosed.
So this thing right here
is freaking me out.
(Laughter)
It's probably why I'm a bit panicked,
other than all the caffeine
I've had and the sugar.
But this is really creepy
for an entrepreneur.
Attention deficit disorder,
bipolar disorder.
Do you know that bipolar disorder
is nicknamed the CEO disease?
Ted Turner's got it. Steve Jobs has it.
All three of the founders
of Netscape had it.
I could go on and on.
Kids -- you can see these signs in kids.
And we're giving them Ritalin and saying,
"Don't be an entrepreneurial type.
Fit into this other system
and try to become a student."
Sorry, entrepreneurs aren't students.
We fast-track. We figure out the game.
I stole essays. I cheated on exams.
I hired kids to do my accounting
assignments in university
for 13 consecutive assignments.
But as an entrepreneur, you don't do
accounting, you hire accountants.
So I just figured that out earlier.
(Laughter)
(Applause)
At least I can admit I cheated
in university; most of you won't.
I'm also quoted -- and I told
the person who wrote the textbook --
I'm now quoted in that exact same
university textbook
in every Canadian university
and college studies --
in managerial accounting,
I'm chapter eight.
I open up chapter eight,
talking about budgeting.
I told the author,
after they did my interview,
that I cheated in that same course.
She thought it was too funny
to not include it.
But kids, you can see these signs in them.
The definition of entrepreneur
is "a person who organizes, operates
and assumes the risk
of a business venture."
That doesn't mean you have
to go to an MBA program,
or that you have to get through school.
It just means that those few things
have to feel right in your gut.
We've heard, "Is it nurture
or is it nature?" Right?
Is it thing one or thing two? What is it?
Well, I don't think it's either.
I think it can be both.
I was groomed as an entrepreneur.
When I was growing up
as a young kid, I had no choice,
because I was taught at a very early age,
when my dad realized I didn't fit
into everything else
that was being taught to me in school,
that he could teach me
to figure out business at an early age.
He groomed us, the three of us,
to hate the thought of having a job
and to love the fact of creating companies
where we could employ other people.
My first business venture:
I was seven years old, in Winnipeg.
I was in my bedroom
with one of those long extension cords,
calling all the dry cleaners in Winnipeg
to find out how much they'd pay
me for coat hangers.
And my mom came into the room and said,
"Where are you going to get the hangers
to sell to the dry cleaners?"
And I said, "Let's go look
in the basement."
We went down to the basement,
and I opened up this cupboard.
There was about 1,000 hangers
that I'd collected,
because, when I told her
I was going out to play,
I was going door to door
in the neighborhood
to collect hangers to put in the basement,
because I saw her
a few weeks before that --
you could get paid, they used to pay
two cents per coat hanger.
So I was like, well,
there's all kinds of hangers,
so I'll just go get them.
I knew she wouldn't want me to get them,
so I just did it anyway.
And I learned that you could
actually negotiate with people.
This one guy offered me three cents
and I got him up to three and a half.
I even knew at seven years old
that I could get
a fractional percent of a cent,
and people would pay it,
because it multiplied up.
At seven years old I figured it out.
I got three and a half cents
for 1,000 hangers.
I sold license plate
protectors door to door.
My dad actually made me go find someone
who would sell me them at wholesale.
At nine years old, I walked
around in the city of Sudbury
selling license-plate
protectors door to door.
And I remember
this one customer so vividly --
I also did some other stuff
with these clients, I sold newspapers,
and he wouldn't buy
a newspaper from me, ever.
But I was convinced I was going to get him
to buy a license-plate protector.
And he's like, "We don't need one."
I said, "But you've got two cars."
Remember, I'm nine years old.
I'm like, "You have two cars and they
don't have license-plate protectors.
And this car has one license plate
that's all crumpled up."
He said, "That's my wife's car."
I said, "Why don't we test one on her car
and see if it lasts longer?"
So I knew there were two cars
with two license plates on each.
If I couldn't sell all four,
I could at least get one.
I learned that at a young age.
I did comic book arbitrage.
When I was about 10 years old,
I sold comic books
out of our cottage on Georgian Bay.
I would go biking
up to the end of the beach,
buy all the comics from the poor kids,
then go back to the other end of the beach
to sell them to the rich kids.
It was obvious to me: buy low, sell high.
You've got this demand
over here that has money.
Don't try to sell to the poor kids;
they don't have cash.
The rich people do. Obvious, right?
It's like a recession.
So there's a recession.
There's still 13 trillion dollars
circulating in the US economy.
Go get some of that.
I learned that at a young age.
I also learned, don't reveal your source:
I got beat up after four weeks of this,
because one of the rich kids found out
where I was buying my comics,
and didn't like that he was paying more.
I was forced to get
a paper route at 10 years old.
I didn't want a paper route, but my dad
said, "That's your next business."
Not only did he get me one,
but I had to get two.
He wanted me to hire someone
to deliver half the papers,
which I did.
Then I realized: collecting tips
is how you made all the money.
So I'd collect tips and get payment.
I would collect for the papers --
he could just deliver them.
Because then I realized
I could make money.
By this point, I was definitely
not going to be an employee.
(Laughter)
My dad owned an automotive
and industrial repair shop.
He had all these old
automotive parts lying around.
They had this old brass and copper.
I asked what he did with it,
and he said he just throws it out.
I said, "Wouldn't somebody pay
for that?" And he goes, "Maybe."
Remember: at 10 years old, 34 years ago,
I saw opportunity in this stuff,
I saw there was money in garbage.
And I collected it from the automotive
shops in the area on my bicycle.
Then my dad would drive me on Saturdays
to a scrap metal recycler
where I got paid.
And I thought that was kind of cool.
Strangely enough, 30 years later,
we're building 1-800-GOT-JUNK?
and making money off that, too.
I built these little pincushions
when I was 11 years old in Cubs.
We made these pincushions
for our moms for Mother's Day
out of wooden clothespins --
when we used to hang clothes
on clotheslines outside.
And you'd make these chairs.
And I had these little pillows
that I would sew up.
And you could stuff pins in them.
Because people used to sew
and they needed a pincushion.
But I realized you had to have options,
so I spray-painted
a whole bunch of them brown,
so when I went to the door,
it wasn't, "Do you want to buy one?"
It was, "Which color would you like?"
I'm 10 years old;
you're not going to say no,
especially if you have two options,
the brown one or the clear one.
So I learned that lesson at a young age.
I learned that manual labor really sucks.
Right, like cutting lawns is brutal.
But because I had to cut lawns
all summer for all of our neighbors
and get paid to do that,
I realized that recurring revenue
from one client is amazing,
that if I land this client once,
and every week I get paid by that person,
that's way better than trying to sell
one clothespin thing to one person,
because you can't sell them more.
So I love that recurring revenue model
I started to learn at a young age.
Remember, I was being groomed to do this.
I was not allowed to have jobs.
I would go to the golf course
and caddy for people,
but I realized there was this one hill
on our golf course, the 13th hole,
that had this huge hill,
and people could never
get their bags up it.
So I'd sit there in a lawn chair
and carry for all the people
who didn't have caddies.
I'd carry their golf bags to the top;
they'd pay me a dollar,
while my friends worked for hours
hauling some guy's bag around
for 10 bucks.
I'm like, "That's stupid.
You have to work for five hours.
That doesn't make sense. Figure out
a way to make more money faster.
Every week, I'd go to the corner store
and buy all these pops,
Then I'd deliver them
to these 70-year-old women playing bridge.
They'd give me their orders
for the following week.
I'd deliver pop and charge twice.
I had this captured market.
You didn't need contracts, you just needed
to have a supply and demand
and this audience who bought into you.
These women weren't going
to go to anybody else
because they liked me,
and I kind of figured it out.
I went and got golf balls
from golf courses.
But everybody else was looking in the bush
and looking in the ditches for golf balls.
I'm like, screw that. They're in the pond.
And nobody's going into the pond.
So I'd go into the ponds and crawl
around and pick them up with my toes,
just pick them up with both feet.
You can't do it onstage.
You get the golf balls,
throw them in your bathing suit trunks
and when you're done, you've got
a couple hundred of them.
But the problem is, people
didn't want all the golf balls.
So I just packaged them.
I'm like 12, right?
I packaged them up three ways.
I had the Pinnacles, DDHs
and the really cool ones.
Those sold for two dollars each.
Then I had the good ones
that didn't look crappy: 50 cents each.
And then I'd sell 50 at a time
of all the crappy ones.
And they could use those
for practice balls.
I sold sunglasses when I was in school,
to all the kids in high school.
This is what really kind of gets
everybody hating you,
because you're trying to extract money
from all your friends all the time.
But it paid the bills.
So I sold lots and lots of sunglasses.
Then when the school shut me down --
they called me into the office
and told me I couldn't do it --
I went to the gas stations and sold
lots of them to the gas stations
and had the gas stations
sell them to their customers.
That was cool because then,
I had retail outlets.
I think I was 14.
Then I paid my entire way through
first year of university at Carlton
by selling wineskins door to door.
You know you can hold
a 40-ounce bottle of rum
and two bottles of coke in a wineskin?
So what, right? But you know what?
Stuff that down your shorts
when you go to a football game,
you can get booze in for free.
Everybody bought them.
Supply, demand, big opportunity.
I also branded it, so I sold them
for five times the normal cost.
It had our university logo on it.
You know, we teach our kids
and we buy them games,
but why don't we get them games,
if they're entrepreneurial kids,
that nurture the traits
you need to be entrepreneurs?
Why don't you teach them
not to waste money?
I remember being told to walk
out into the middle of a street
in Banff, Alberta.
I'd thrown a penny out in the street,
and my dad said, "Go pick it up.
I work too damn hard for my money.
I'm not going to see you waste a penny."
I remember that lesson to this day.
Allowances teach kids the wrong habits.
Allowances, by nature,
are teaching kids to think about a job.
An entrepreneur doesn't expect
a regular paycheck.
Allowance is breeding kids at a young age
to expect a regular paycheck.
That's wrong, for me,
if you want to raise entrepreneurs.
What I do with my kids, nine and seven,
is teach them to walk
around the house and the yard,
looking for stuff that needs to get done.
Come and tell me what it is.
Or I'll say, "Here's what I need done."
And then, you know
what we do? We negotiate.
They go around looking for what it is,
then we negotiate what they'll get paid.
They don't have a regular check,
but they have opportunities
to find more stuff,
and learn the skill of negotiating
and of finding opportunities.
You breed that kind of stuff.
Each of my kids has two piggy banks.
Fifty percent of all the money they earn
goes in their house account,
50 percent goes in their toy account.
The toy account,
they spend on whatever they want.
The 50 percent in their house account,
every six months, goes to the bank.
they walk up with me.
Every year, all the money
in the bank goes to their broker.
Both my nine- and seven-year-olds
have a stockbroker already.
I'm teaching them
to force that savings habit.
It drives me crazy
that 30-year-olds are saying,
"Maybe I'll start contributing
to my RSP now."
Shit, you've missed 25 years.
You can teach those habits to young kids,
when they don't even feel the pain yet.
Don't read bedtime stories every night --
maybe four nights of the week,
and three nights, have them tell stories.
Why don't you sit down with kids
and give them four items,
a red shirt, a blue tie,
a kangaroo and a laptop,
and have them tell a story
about those four things?
My kids do that all the time.
It teaches them to sell,
teaches them creativity,
teaches them to think on their feet.
Do that kind of stuff, have fun with it.
Get kids to stand up
in front of groups and talk,
even if it's just
in front of their friends,
and do plays and have speeches.
Those are entrepreneurial traits
you want to be nurturing.
Show kids what bad customers
or bad employees look like.
Show them grumpy employees.
When you see grumpy
customer service, point it out.
Say, "By the way,
that guy is a crappy employee."
And say, "These are good ones."
(Laughter)
If you go into a restaurant
and have bad customer service,
show them what bad
customer service looks like.
(Laughter)
We have all these lessons in front of us,
but we don't take those opportunities;
we teach kids to get a tutor.
Imagine if you actually took
all the kids' junk in the house right now,
all the toys they outgrew two years ago
and said, "Why don't we sell
some of this on Craigslist and Kijiji?"
And they actually sell it and learn
how to find scammers when offers come in.
They can come into your account
or a sub account or whatever.
But teach them how to fix
the price, guess the price,
pull up the photos.
Teach them how to do
that kind of stuff and make money.
Then 50 percent
goes in their house account,
50 percent in their toy account.
My kids love this stuff.
Some of the entrepreneurial traits
you've got to nurture in kids:
attainment, tenacity, leadership,
introspection, interdependence, values.
All these traits, you can find in young
kids, and you can help nurture them.
Look for that kind of stuff.
There's two traits I want you
to also look out for
that we don't get out of their system.
Don't medicate kids
for attention deficit disorder
unless it is really, really freaking bad.
(Applause)
The same with the whole things
on mania and stress and depression,
unless it is so clinically brutal, man.
Bipolar disorder is nicknamed
"the CEO disease."
When Steve Jurvetson, Jim Clark
and Jim Barksdale have all got it,
and they built Netscape --
imagine if they were given Ritalin.
We wouldn't have that stuff, right?
Al Gore really would have had
to invented the Internet.
(Laughter)
These are the skills
we should be teaching in the classroom,
as well as everything else.
I'm not saying don't get kids
to want to be lawyers.
But how about getting entrepreneurship
to be ranked right up there
with the rest of them?
Because there's huge
opportunities in that.
I want to close with a quick video
that was done by one
of the companies I mentor.
These guys, Grasshopper.
It's about kids.
It's about entrepreneurship.
Hopefully, this inspires you
to take what you've heard from me
and do something with it
to change the world.
[Kid... "And you thought
you could do anything?"]
[You still can.]
[Because a lot of what
we consider impossible]
[is easy to overcome]
[Because in case you haven't
noticed, we live in a place where]
[one individual can make a difference]
[Want proof?]
[Just look at the people
who built our country:]
[Our parents, grandparents,
our aunts, uncles]
[They were immigrants, newcomers
ready to make their mark]
[Maybe they came with very little]
[or perhaps they didn't own
anything except for]
[a single brilliant idea]
[These people were thinkers, doers]
[innovators]
[until they came up with the name]
[entrepreneurs]
[They change the way we think
about what is possible.]
[They have a clear vision
of how life can be better]
[for all of us, even when
times are tough.]
[Right now, it's hard to see]
[when our view is cluttered
with obstacles.]
[But turbulence creates opportunities]
[for success, achievement, and pushes us]
[to discover new ways of doing things]
[So what opportunities
will you go after and why?]
[If you're an entrepreneur]
[you know that risk isn't the reward.]
[No. The rewards are driving innovation]
[changing people's lives. Creating jobs.]
[Fueling growth.]
[And making a better world.]
[Entrepreneurs are everywhere.]
[They run small businesses
that support our economy,]
[design tools to help you]
[stay connected with friends,
family and colleagues]
[And they're finding new ways of helping
to solve society's oldest problems.]
[Do you know an entrepreneur?]
[Entrepreneurs can be anyone
Even... you]
[So seize the opportunity to create
the job you always wanted]
[Help heal the economy]
[Make a difference.]
[Take your business to new heights,]
[but most importantly,]
[remember when you were a kid]
[when everything was within your reach,]
[and then say to yourself
quietly, but with determination:]
[it still is.]
Thank you very much for having me.
(Applause)
As a boy,
I loved cars.
When I turned 18,
I lost my best friend to a car accident.
Like this.
And then I decided I'd dedicate my life
to saving one million people
every year.
Now I haven't succeeded, so this is just a progress report,
but I'm here to tell you a little bit about self-driving cars.
I saw the concept first
in the DARPA Grand Challenges
where the U.S. government issued a prize
to build a self-driving car that could navigate a desert.
And even though a hundred teams were there,
these cars went nowhere.
So we decided at Stanford to build a different self-driving car.
We built the hardware and the software.
We made it learn from us,
and we set it free in the desert.
And the unimaginable happened:
it became the first car
to ever return from a DARPA Grand Challenge,
winning Stanford 2 million dollars.
Yet I still hadn't saved a single life.
Since, our work has focused
on building driving cars
that can drive anywhere by themselves --
any street in California.
We've driven 140,000 miles.
Our cars have sensors
by which they magically can see
everything around them
and make decisions
about every aspect of driving.
It's the perfect driving mechanism.
We've driven in cities,
like in San Francisco here.
We've driven from San Francisco to Los Angeles on Highway 1.
We've encountered joggers,
busy highways, toll booths,
and this is without a person in the loop;
the car just drives itself.
In fact, while we drove 140,000 miles,
people didn't even notice.
Mountain roads,
day and night,
and even crooked Lombard Street
in San Francisco.
(Laughter)
Sometimes our cars get so crazy,
they even do little stunts.
(Video) Man: Oh, my God.
What?
Second Man: It's driving itself.
Sebastian Thrun: Now I can't get my friend Harold back to life,
but I can do something for all the people who died.
Do you know that driving accidents
are the number one cause of death for young people?
And do you realize that almost all of those
are due to human error
and not machine error,
and can therefore be prevented by machines?
Do you realize
that we could change the capacity of highways
by a factor of two or three
if we didn't rely on human precision
on staying in the lane --
improve body position
and therefore drive a little bit closer together
on a little bit narrower lanes,
and do away with all traffic jams on highways?
Do you realize that you, TED users,
spend an average
of 52 minutes per day
in traffic,
wasting your time
on your daily commute?
You could regain this time.
This is four billion hours
wasted in this country alone.
And it's 2.4 billion gallons of gasoline wasted.
Now I think there's a vision here, a new technology,
and I'm really looking forward to a time
when generations after us look back at us
and say how ridiculous it was that humans were driving cars.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Growing up in Kenya,
I knew I always wanted
to study biochemistry.
See, I had seen the impact of the high
prevalence of diseases like malaria,
and I wanted to make medicines
that would cure the sick.
So I worked really hard,
got a scholarship to the United States,
where I became a cancer researcher,
and I loved it.
For someone who wants to cure diseases,
there is no higher calling.
Ten years later, I returned
to Kenya to do just that.
A freshly minted PhD,
ready to take on this horrific illness,
which in Kenya was almost
certainly a death sentence.
But instead of landing a job
in a pharmaceutical company
or a hospital,
I found myself drawn
to a different kind of lab,
working with a different
kind of patient --
a patient whose illness was so serious
it impacted every single
person in my country;
a patient who needed to get healthy fast.
That patient was my government.
(Laughter)
See, many of us will agree that lots
of governments are unhealthy today.
(Laughter)
(Applause)
And Kenya was no exception.
When I returned to Kenya in 2014,
there was 17 percent youth unemployment.
And Nairobi, the major business hub,
was rated 177th on the quality
of living index.
It was bad.
Now, an economy is only as healthy
as the entities that make it up.
So when government --
one of its most vital entities --
is weak or unhealthy,
everyone and everything suffers.
Sometimes you might
put a Band-Aid in place
to try and temporarily stop the pain.
Maybe some of you here have participated
in a Band-Aid operation
to an African country --
setting up alternative schools,
building hospitals, digging wells --
because governments there
either weren't or couldn't provide
the services to their citizens.
We all know this is a temporary solution.
There are just some things
Band-Aids can't fix,
like providing an environment
where businesses feel secure
that they'll have an equal opportunity
to be able to run and start
their businesses successfully.
Or there are systems in place
that would protect the private
property that they create.
I would argue,
only government is capable of creating
these necessary conditions
for economies to thrive.
Economies thrive when business are able
to quickly and easily set up shop.
Business owners create new sources
of income for themselves,
new jobs get added into the economy
and then more taxes are paid
to fund public projects.
New business is good for everyone.
And it's such an important measure
of economic growth,
the World Bank has a ranking called
the "Ease of Doing Business Ranking,"
which measures how easy
or difficult it is to start a business
in any given country.
And as you can imagine,
starting or running a business
in a country with an ailing government --
almost impossible.
The President of Kenya knew this,
which is why in 2014,
he came to our lab and asked
us to partner with him
to be able to help Kenya
to jump-start business growth.
He set an ambitious goal:
he wanted Kenya to be ranked top 50
in this World Bank ranking.
In 2014 when he came,
Kenya was ranked 136 out of 189 countries.
We had our work cut out for us.
Fortunately, he came to the right place.
We're not just a Band-Aid kind of team.
We're a group of computer scientists,
mathematicians, engineers
and a cancer researcher,
who understood that in order
to cure the sickness
of a system as big as government,
we needed to examine the whole body,
and then we needed to drill down
all the way from the organs,
into the tissues,
all the way to single cells,
so that we could properly
make a diagnosis.
So with our marching orders
from the President himself,
we embarked on the purest
of the scientific method:
collecting data --
all the data we could get our hands on --
making hypotheses,
creating solutions,
one after the other.
So we met with hundreds of individuals
who worked at government agencies,
from the tax agency, the lands
office, utilities company,
the agency that's responsible
for registering companies,
and with each of them, we observed
them as they served customers,
we documented their processes --
most of them were manual.
We also just went back and looked at
a lot of their previous paperwork
to try and really understand;
to try and diagnose what bodily
malfunctions had occurred
that lead to that 136th spot
on the World Bank list.
What did we find?
Well, in Kenya it was taking 72 days
for a business owner
to register their property,
compared to just one day in New Zealand,
which was ranked second
on the World Bank list.
It took 158 days to get
a new electric connection.
In Korea it took 18 days.
If you wanted to get a construction permit
so you could put up a building,
in Kenya, it was going
to take you 125 days.
In Singapore, which is ranked first,
that would only take you 26 days.
God forbid you had to go to court
to get help in being able to settle
a dispute to enforce a contract,
because that process alone
would take you 465 days.
And if that wasn't bad enough,
you would lose 40 percent
of your claim in just fees --
legal fees, enforcement fees, court fees.
Now, I know what you're thinking:
for there to exist such inefficiencies
in an African country,
there must be corruption.
The very cells that run the show
must be corrupt to the bone.
I thought so, too, actually.
When we started out,
I thought I was going to find
so much corruption,
I was literally going to either die
or get killed in the process.
(Laughter)
But when we dug deeper,
we didn't find corruption
in the classic sense:
slimy gangsters lurking in the darkness,
waiting to grease the palms
of their friends.
What we found was an overwhelming
sense of helplessness.
Our government was sick,
because government
employees felt helpless.
They felt that they were not
empowered to drive change.
And when people feel stuck and helpless,
they stop seeing their role
in a bigger system.
They start to think the work they do
doesn't matter in driving change.
And when that happens,
things slow down,
fall through the cracks
and inefficiencies flourish.
Now imagine with me,
if you had a process
you had to go through --
had no other alternative --
and this process was inefficient, complex
and very, very slow.
What would you do?
I think you might start by trying
to find somebody to outsource it to,
so that they can just
take care of that for you.
If that doesn't work,
maybe you'd consider paying somebody
to just "unofficially" take care
of it on your behalf --
especially if you thought
nobody was going to catch you.
Not out of malice or greed,
just trying to make sure that you get
something to work for you
so you can move on.
Unfortunately, that
is the beginning of corruption.
And if left to thrive and grow,
it seeps into the whole system,
and before you know it,
the whole body is sick.
Knowing this,
we had to start by making sure
that every single stakeholder
we worked with had a shared vision
for what we wanted to do.
So we met with everyone,
from the clerk whose sole job
is to remove staples
from application packets,
to the legal drafters
at the attorney general's office,
to the clerks who are responsible
for serving business owners
when they came to access
government services.
And with them,
we made sure that they understood
how their day-to-day actions
were impacting our ability as a country
to create new jobs
and to attract investments.
No one's role was too small;
everyone's role was vital.
Now, guess what we started to see?
A coalition of government employees
who are excited and ready to drive change,
began to grow and form.
And together we started
to implement changes
that impacted the service
delivery of our country.
The result?
In just two years,
Kenya's ranking moved from 136 to 92.
(Applause)
And in recognition of the significant
reforms we've been able to implement
in such a short time,
Kenya was recognized
to be among the top three
global reformers in the world
two years in a row.
(Applause)
Are we fully healthy?
No.
We have some serious work still to do.
I like to think about these two years
like a weight-loss program.
(Laughter)
It's that time after months
of hard, grueling work at the gym,
and then you get your first
time to weigh yourself,
and you've lost 20 pounds.
You're feeling unstoppable.
Now, some of you may think
this doesn't apply to you.
You're not from Kenya.
You don't intend to be an entrepreneur.
But think with me for just a moment.
When is the last time
you accessed a government service?
Maybe applied for your driver's license,
tried to do your taxes on your own.
It's easy in this political
and global economy
to want to give up when we think
about transforming government.
We can easily resign to the fact
or to the thinking
that government is too inefficient,
too corrupt,
unfixable.
We might even rarely get
some key government responsibilities
to other sectors,
to Band-Aid solutions,
or to just give up and feel helpless.
But just because a system is sick
doesn't mean it's dying.
We cannot afford to give up
when it comes to the challenges
of fixing our governments.
In the end,
what really makes a government healthy
is when healthy cells --
that's you and I --
get to the ground,
roll up our sleeves,
refuse to be helpless
and believe that sometimes,
all it takes is for us
to create some space
for healthy cells to grow and thrive.
Thank you.
(Applause)
I'm a writer-director
who tells social-change stories,
because I believe stories
touch and move us.
Stories humanize
and teach us to empathize.
Stories change us.
When I write and direct plays,
I'm amplifying voices
of disadvantaged groups,
I'm fighting the self-censorship
that has kept many Ugandan artists
away from social, political theater
since the persecution of artists
by former Ugandan president, Idi Amin.
And most importantly,
I am breaking the silence
and provoking meaningful
conversations on taboo issues,
where often "Silence is golden"
is the rule of thumb.
Conversations are important
because they inform
and challenge our minds to think,
and change starts with thinking.
One of my struggles with activism
is its often one-sided nature
that blinds us to alternative view,
that numbs our empathy,
that makes us view those
who see issues differently
as ignorant, self-hating, brainwashed,
sellout or plain stupid.
I believe no one is ignorant.
We are all experts,
only in different fields.
And this is why, for me, the saying
"stay in your truth" is misleading.
Because if you're staying in your truth,
isn't it logical that the person
you believe is wrong
is also staying in their truth?
So, what you have is two extremes
that shut out all possible
avenues of conversations.
I create provocative theater and film
to touch, humanize
and move disagreeing parties
to the conversation table
to bridge misunderstandings.
I know that listening to one another
will not magically solve all problems.
But it will give a chance
to create avenues
to start to work together to solve
many of humanity's problems.
With my first play, "Silent Voices,"
based on interviews with victims
of the Northern Uganda war
between the government
and Joseph Kony's LRA rebel group,
I brought together victims,
political leaders, religious leaders,
cultural leaders, the Amnesty Commission
and transitional justice leadership
for critical conversations on issues
of justice for war crime victims --
the first of its kind
in the history of Uganda.
And so many powerful things happened,
that I can't even
cover them all right now.
Victims were given the opportunity
to sit at the table
with Amnesty Commission leadership,
and they expressed
the big injustice they suffered
when the Commission ignored them
and instead facilitated the resettlement
of the war perpetrators.
And the Amnesty Commission
acknowledged the victims' pain
and explained the thinking
behind their flawed approaches.
But one of the things
that has stayed with me
is when, during my Northern Uganda
tour of the play,
a man approached me and introduced himself
as a former rebel soldier of Joseph Kony.
He told me that he didn't want me to leave
feeling disappointed,
due to some of what I considered
inappropriate laughter.
He explained that his
was a laughter of embarrassment
and a recognition
of his own embarrassment.
He saw himself in the actors onstage
and saw the meaninglessness
of his past actions.
So I say: share your truths.
Listen to one another's truths.
You will discover
a more powerfully uniting truth
in the middle ground.
When I lived in the USA,
many of my American friends
would be shocked at my ignorance
at fancy Western dishes
like lasagna, for instance.
(Laughter)
And my question to them would be,
"Well, do you know malakwang?"
And then I would tell them
about malakwang,
a fancy vegetable dish from my culture.
And they would tell me about lasagna.
And we would leave
richer and fuller individuals.
Therefore, share your recipe truth.
It makes for a better meal.
Thank you.
(Applause)
My name is Arvind Gupta, and I'm a toymaker.
I've been making toys for the last 30 years.
The early '70s, I was in college.
It was a very revolutionary time.
It was a political ferment, so to say --
students out in the streets of Paris,
revolting against authority.
America was jolted
by the anti-Vietnam movement, the Civil Rights movement.
In India, we had the Naxalite movement,
the [unclear] movement.
But you know, when there is a political churning of society,
it unleashes a lot of energy.
The National Movement of India
was testimony to that.
Lots of people resigned from well-paid jobs
and jumped into the National Movement.
Now in the early '70s,
one of the great programs in India
was to revitalize
primary science in village schools.
There was a person, Anil Sadgopal, did a Ph.D. from Caltech
and returned back as a molecular biologist
in India's cutting-edge research institute, the TIFR.
At 31, he was not able
to relate the kind of [unclear] research,
which he was doing with the lives of the ordinary people.
So he designed and went and started a village science program.
Many people were inspired by this.
The slogan of the early '70s
was "Go to the people.
Live with them; love them.
Start from what they know. Build on what they have."
This was kind of the defining slogan.
Well I took one year.
I joined Telco, made TATA trucks, pretty close to Pune.
I worked there for two years,
and I realized that I was not born to make trucks.
Often one doesn't know what one wants to do,
but it's good enough to know what you don't want to do.
So I took one year off, and I went to this village science program.
And it was a turning point.
It was a very small village --
a weekly bazaar
where people, just once in a week, they put in all the vats.
So I said, "I'm going to spend a year over here."
So I just bought one specimen
of everything which was sold on the roadside.
And one thing which I found
was this black rubber.
This is called a cycle valve tube.
When you pump in air in a bicycle, you use a bit of this.
And some of these models --
so you take a bit of this cycle valve tube,
you can put two matchsticks inside this, and you make a flexible joint.
It's a joint of tubes. You start by teaching angles --
an acute angle, a right angle, an obtuse angle, a straight angle.
It's like its own little coupling.
If you have three of them, and you loop them together,
well you make a triangle.
With four, you make a square,
you make a pentagon, you make a hexagon,
you make all these kind of polygons.
And they have some wonderful properties.
If you look at the hexagon, for instance,
it's like an amoeba, which is constantly changing its own profile.
You can just pull this out, this becomes a rectangle.
You give it a push, this becomes a parallelogram.
But this is very shaky.
Look at the pentagon, for instance,
pull this out -- it becomes a boat shape trapezium.
Push it and it becomes house shaped.
This becomes an isosceles triangle --
again, very shaky.
This square might look very square and prim.
Give it a little push -- this becomes a rhombus.
It becomes kite-shaped.
But give a child a triangle,
he can't do a thing to it.
Why use triangles?
Because triangles are the only rigid structures.
We can't make a bridge with squares
because the train would come, it would start doing a jig.
Ordinary people know about this
because if you go to a village in India,
they might not have gone to engineering college,
but no one makes a roof placed like this.
Because if they put tiles on top, it's just going to crash.
They always make a triangular roof.
Now this is people science.
And if you were to just poke a hole over here
and put a third matchstick,
you'll get a T joint.
And if I were to poke all the three legs of this
in the three vertices of this triangle,
I would make a tetrahedron.
So you make all these 3D shapes.
You make a tetrahedron like this.
And once you make these,
you make a little house.
Put this on top.
You can make a joint of four. You can make a joint of six.
You just need a ton.
Now this was -- you make a joint of six,
you make an icosahedron.
You can play around with it.
This makes an igloo.
Now this is in 1978.
I was a 24-year-old young engineer.
And I thought this was so much better than making trucks.
(Applause)
If you, as a matter of fact, put four marbles inside,
you simulate the molecular structure of methane, CH4.
Four atoms of hydrogen, the four points of the tetrahedron,
which means the little carbon atom.
Well since then,
I just thought that I've been really privileged
to go to over 2,000 schools in my country --
village schools, government schools,
municipal schools, Ivy League schools --
I've been invited by most of them.
And every time I go to a school,
I see a gleam in the eyes of the children.
I see hope. I see happiness in their faces.
Children want to make things. Children want to do things.
Now this, we make lots and lots of pumps.
Now this is a little pump
with which you could inflate a balloon.
It's a real pump. You could actually pop the balloon.
And we have a slogan
that the best thing a child can do with a toy is to break it.
So all you do is --
it's a very kind of provocative statement --
this old bicycle tube and this old plastic [unclear]
This filling cap will go very snugly into an old bicycle tube.
And this is how you make a valve.
You put a little sticky tape.
This is one-way traffic.
Well we make lots and lots of pumps.
And this is the other one --
that you just take a straw, and you just put a stick inside
and you make two half-cuts.
Now this is what you do,
is you bend both these legs into a triangle,
and you just wrap some tape around.
And this is the pump.
And now, if you have this pump,
it's like a great, great sprinkler.
It's like a centrifuge.
If you spin something, it tends to fly out.
(Applause)
Well in terms of -- if you were in Andhra Pradesh,
you would make this with the palmyra leaf.
Many of our folk toys
have great science principles.
If you spin-top something, it tends to fly out.
If I do it with both hands, you can see this fun Mr. Flying Man.
Right.
This is a toy which is made from paper. It's amazing.
There are four pictures.
You see insects,
you see frogs, snakes, eagles, butterflies,
frogs, snakes, eagles.
Here's a paper which you could [unclear] --
designed by a mathematician at Harvard in 1928,
Arthur Stone,
documented by Martin Gardner in many of his many books.
But this is great fun for children.
They all study about the food chain.
The insects are eaten by the frogs; the frogs are eaten by the snakes;
the snakes are eaten by the eagles.
And this can be, if you had a whole photocopy paper --
A4 size paper --
you could be in a municipal school, you could be in a government school --
a paper, a scale and a pencil -- no glue, no scissors.
In three minutes, you just fold this up.
And what you could use it for is just limited by your imagination.
If you take a smaller paper, you make a smaller flexagon.
With a bigger one, you make a bigger one.
Now this is a pencil with a few slots over here.
And you put a little fan here.
And this is a hundred-year-old toy.
There have been six major research papers on this.
There's some grooves over here, you can see.
And if I take a reed -- if I rub this,
something very amazing happens.
Six major research papers on this.
As a matter of fact, Feynman, as a child, was very fascinated by this.
He wrote a paper on this.
And you don't need the three billion-dollar Hadron Collider
for doing this. (Laughter) (Applause)
This is there for every child,
and every child can enjoy this.
If you want to put a colored disk,
well all these seven colors coalesce.
And this is what Newton talked about 400 years back,
that white light's made of seven colors,
just by spinning this around.
This is a straw.
What we've done, we've just sealed both the ends with tape,
nipped the right corner and the bottom left corner,
so there's holes in the opposite corners, there's a little hole over here.
This is a kind of a blowing straw.
I just put this inside this.
There's a hole here, and I shut this.
And this costs very little money to make --
great fun for children to do.
What we do
is make a very simple electric motor.
Now this is the simplest motor on Earth.
The most expensive thing is the battery inside this.
If you have a battery, it costs five cents to make it.
This is an old bicycle tube,
which gives you a broad rubber band, two safety pins.
This is a permanent magnet.
Whenever current flows through the coil, this becomes an electromagnet.
It's the interaction of both these magnets
which makes this motor spin.
We made 30,000.
Teachers who have been teaching science for donkey years,
they just muck up the definition and they spit it out.
When teachers make it, children make it.
You can see a gleam in their eye.
They get a thrill
of what science is all about.
And this science is not a rich man's game.
In a democratic country,
science must reach to our most oppressed,
to the most marginalized children.
This program started with 16 schools
and spread to 1,500 government schools.
Over 100,000 children learn science this way.
And we're just trying to see possibilities.
Look, this is the tetrapak --
awful materials from the point of view of the environment.
There are six layers -- three layers of plastic, aluminum --
which are are sealed together.
They are fused together, so you can't separate them.
Now you can just make a little network like this
and fold them and stick them together
and make an icosahedron.
So something which is trash,
which is choking all the seabirds,
you could just recycle this into a very, very joyous --
all the platonic solids can be made with things like this.
This is a little straw,
and what you do is you just nip two corners here,
and this becomes like a baby crocodile's mouth.
You put this in your mouth, and you blow.
(Honk)
It's children's delight, a teacher's envy, as they say.
You're not able to see how the sound is produced,
because the thing which is vibrating goes inside my mouth.
I'm going to keep this outside, to blow out. I'm going to suck in air.
(Honk)
So no one actually needs to muck up the production of sound
with wire vibrations.
The other is that you keep blowing at it,
keep making the sound,
and you keep cutting it.
And something very, very nice happens.
(Honk)
(Applause)
And when you get a very small one --
(Honk)
This is what the kids teach you. You can also do this.
Well before I go any further,
this is something worth sharing.
This is a touching slate meant for blind children.
This is strips of Velcro, this is my drawing slate,
and this is my drawing pen,
which is basically a film box.
It's basically like a fisherman's line,
a fishing line.
And this is wool over here.
If I crank the handle, all the wool goes inside.
And what a blind child can do is to just draw this.
Wool sticks on Velcro.
There are 12 million blind children in our country --
(Applause)
who live in a world of darkness.
And this has come as a great boon to them.
There's a factory out there making our children blind,
not able to provide them with food,
not able to provide them with vitamin A.
But this has come as a great boon for them.
There are no patents. Anyone can make it.
This is very, very simple.
You can see, this is the generator. It's a crank generator.
These are two magnets.
This is a large pulley made by sandwiching rubber between two old CDs.
Small pulley and two strong magnets.
And this fiber turns a wire attached to an LED.
If I spin this pulley, the small one's going to spin much faster.
There will be a spinning magnetic field.
Lines, of course, would be cut, the force will be generated.
And you can see, this LED is going to glow.
So this is a small crank generator.
Well, this is, again,
it's just a ring, a steel ring with steel nuts.
And what you can do
is just, if you give it a twirl,
well they just keep going on.
And imagine a bunch of kids
standing in a circle
and just waiting for the steel ring to be passed on.
And they'd be absolutely joyous playing with this.
Well in the end, what we can also do:
we use a lot of old newspapers
to make caps.
This is worthy of Sachin Tendulkar.
It's a great cricket cap. (Laughter) (Applause)
When first you see Nehru and Gandhi,
this is the Nehru cap -- just half a newspaper.
We make lots of toys with newspapers,
and this is one of them.
And this is -- you can see --
this is a flapping bird.
All of our old newspapers, we cut them into little squares.
And if you have one of these birds --
children in Japan have been making this bird for many, many years.
And you can see,
this is a little fantail bird.
Well in the end, I'll just end with a story.
This is called "The Captain's Hat Story."
The captain was a captain of a sea-going ship.
It goes very slowly.
And there were lots of passengers on the ship,
and they were getting bored, so the captain invited them on the deck.
"Wear all your colorful clothes and sing and dance,
and I'll provide you with good food and drinks."
And the captain would wear a cap everyday
and join in the regalia.
The first day, it was a huge umbrella cap,
like a captain's cap.
That night, when the passengers would be sleeping,
he would give it one more fold,
and the second day, he would be wearing a fireman's cap --
with a little shoot just like a designer cap,
because it protects the spinal cord.
And the second night, he would take the same cap
and give it another fold.
And the third day, it would be a Shikari cap --
just like an adventurer's cap.
And the third night, he would give it two more folds --
and this is a very, very famous cap.
If you've seen any of our Bollywood films,
this is what the policeman wears,
it's called a zapalu cap.
It's been catapulted to international glory.
And we must not forget that he was the captain of the ship.
So that's a ship.
And now the end:
everyone was enjoying the journey very much.
They were singing and dancing.
Suddenly there was a storm and huge waves.
And all the ship can do is to dance and pitch along with the waves.
A huge wave comes and slaps the front
and knocks it down.
And another one comes and slaps the aft and knocks it down.
And there's a third one over here.
This swallows the bridge and knocks it down.
And the ship sinks,
and the captain has lost everything,
but for a life jacket.
Thank you so much.
(Applause)
I am a chef
and a food policy guy,
but I come from a whole
family of teachers.
My sister is a special ed
teacher in Chicago.
My father just retired
after 25 years teaching fifth grade.
My aunt and uncle were professors.
My cousins all teach.
Everybody in my family, basically,
teaches except for me.
They taught me that the only way
to get the right answers
is to ask the right questions.
So what are the right questions
when it comes to improving
the educational outcomes for our children?
There's obviously
many important questions,
but I think the following
is a good place to start:
What do we think the connection is
between a child's growing mind
and their growing body?
What can we expect our kids to learn
if their diets are full of sugar
and empty of nutrients?
What can they possibly learn
if their bodies
are literally going hungry?
And with all the resources
that we are pouring into schools,
we should stop and ask ourselves:
Are we really setting
our kids up for success?
Now, a few years ago,
I was a judge on a cooking
competition called "Chopped."
Four chefs compete
with mystery ingredients
to see who can cook the best dishes.
Except for this episode --
it was a very special one.
Instead of four overzealous chefs
trying to break into the limelight --
something that I would know
nothing about --
(Laughter)
these chefs were school chefs;
you know, the women that you used
to call "lunch ladies,"
but the ones I insist
we call "school chefs."
Now, these women -- God bless
these women --
spend their day cooking
for thousands of kids,
breakfast and lunch,
with only $2.68 per lunch,
with only about a dollar of that
actually going to the food.
In this episode,
the main-course
mystery ingredient was quinoa.
Now, I know it's been a long time
since most of you have had a school lunch,
and we've made a lot
of progress on nutrition,
but quinoa still is not a staple
in most school cafeterias.
(Laughter)
So this was a challenge.
But the dish that I will never forget
was cooked by a woman
named Cheryl Barbara.
Cheryl was the nutrition director
at High School in the Community
in Connecticut.
She cooked this delicious pasta.
It was amazing.
It was a pappardelle with Italian sausage,
kale, Parmesan cheese.
It was delicious, like,
restaurant-quality good, except --
she basically just threw the quinoa,
pretty much uncooked,
into the dish.
It was a strange choice,
and it was super crunchy.
(Laughter)
So I took on the TV accusatory judge thing
that you're supposed to do,
and I asked her why she did that.
Cheryl responded, "Well, first,
I don't know what quinoa is."
(Laughter)
"But I do know that it's a Monday,
and that in my school,
at High School in the Community,
I always cook pasta."
See, Cheryl explained
that for many of her kids,
there were no meals on the weekends.
No meals on Saturday.
No meals on Sunday, either.
So she cooked pasta
because she wanted to make sure
she cooked something she knew
her children would eat.
Something that would stick
to their ribs, she said.
Something that would fill them up.
Cheryl talked about how,
by the time Monday came,
her kids' hunger pangs were so intense
that they couldn't even begin
to think about learning.
Food was the only thing on their mind.
The only thing.
And unfortunately, the stats --
they tell the same story.
So, let's put this
into the context of a child.
And we're going to focus on
the most important meal
of the day, breakfast.
Meet Allison.
She's 12 years old,
she's smart as a whip
and she wants to be a physicist
when she grows up.
If Allison goes to a school
that serves a nutritious breakfast
to all of their kids,
here's what's going to follow.
Her chances of getting a nutritious meal,
one with fruit and milk,
one lower in sugar and salt,
dramatically increase.
Allison will have a lower rate
of obesity than the average kid.
She'll have to visit the nurse less.
She'll have lower levels
of anxiety and depression.
She'll have better behavior.
She'll have better attendance,
and she'll show up on time more often.
Why?
Well, because there's a good meal
waiting for her at school.
Overall, Allison is in much better health
than the average school kid.
So what about that kid
who doesn't have a nutritious
breakfast waiting for him?
Well, meet Tommy.
He's also 12. He's a wonderful kid.
He wants to be a doctor.
By the time Tommy is in kindergarten,
he's already underperforming in math.
By the time he's in third grade,
he's got lower math and reading scores.
By the time he's 11,
it's more likely that Tommy will have
to have repeated a grade.
Research shows that kids
who do not have consistent nourishment,
particularly at breakfast,
have poor cognitive function overall.
So how widespread is this problem?
Well, unfortunately, it's pervasive.
Let me give you two stats
that seem like they're on opposite
ends of the issue,
but are actually two sides
of the same coin.
On the one hand,
one in six Americans are food insecure,
including 16 million children --
almost 20 percent --
are food insecure.
In this city alone, in New York City,
474,000 kids under the age of 18
face hunger every year.
It's crazy.
On the other hand,
diet and nutrition is the number one cause
of preventable death and disease
in this country, by far.
And fully a third of the kids
that we've been talking about tonight
are on track to have diabetes
in their lifetime.
Now, what's hard
to put together but is true
is that, many times,
these are the same children.
So they fill up on the unhealthy
and cheap calories
that surround them in their communities
and that their families can afford.
But then by the end of the month,
food stamps run out
or hours get cut at work,
and they don't have the money
to cover the basic cost of food.
But we should be able
to solve this problem, right?
We know what the answers are.
As part of my work at the White House,
we instituted a program
that for all schools that had
40 percent more low-income kids,
we could serve breakfast and lunch
to every kid in that school.
For free.
This program has been
incredibly successful,
because it helped us overcome
a very difficult barrier
when it came to getting kids
a nutritious breakfast.
And that was the barrier of stigma.
See, schools serve
breakfast before school,
and it was only available
for the poor kids.
So everybody knew who was poor
and who needed government help.
Now, all kids, no matter how much
or how little their parents make,
have a lot of pride.
So what happened?
Well, the schools that have
implemented this program
saw an increase in math and reading
scores by 17.5 percent.
17.5 percent.
And research shows that when kids
have a consistent, nutritious breakfast,
their chances of graduating
increase by 20 percent.
20 percent.
When we give our kids
the nourishment they need,
we give them the chance to thrive,
both in the classroom and beyond.
Now, you don't have to trust me on this,
but you should talk to Donna Martin.
I love Donna Martin.
Donna Martin is the school nutrition
director at Burke County
in Waynesboro, Georgia.
Burke County is one
of the poorest districts
in the fifth-poorest state in the country,
and about 100 percent of Donna's students
live at or below the poverty line.
A few years ago,
Donna decided to get out ahead
of the new standards that were coming,
and overhaul her nutrition standards.
She improved and added
fruit and vegetables and whole grains.
She served breakfast in the classroom
to all of her kids.
And she implemented a dinner program.
Why?
Well, many of her kids didn't have
dinner when they went home.
So how did they respond?
Well, the kids loved the food.
They loved the better nutrition,
and they loved not being hungry.
But Donna's biggest supporter
came from an unexpected place.
His name from Eric Parker,
and he was the head football coach
for the Burke County Bears.
Now, Coach Parker had coached
mediocre teams for years.
The Bears often ended
in the middle of the pack --
a big disappointment in one
of the most passionate football states
in the Union.
But the year Donna changed the menus,
the Bears not only won their division,
they went on to win
the state championship,
beating the Peach County Trojans
28-14.
(Laughter)
And Coach Parker,
he credited that championship
to Donna Martin.
When we give our kids
the basic nourishment,
they're going to thrive.
And it's not just
up to the Cheryl Barbaras
and the Donna Martins of the world.
It's on all of us.
And feeding our kids the basic nutrition
is just the starting point.
What I've laid out is really a model
for so many of the most pressing
issues that we face.
If we focus on the simple goal
of properly nourishing ourselves,
we could see a world
that is more stable and secure;
we could dramatically improve
our economic productivity;
we could transform our health care
and we could go a long way
in ensuring that the Earth can provide
for generations to come.
Food is that place
where our collective efforts
can have the greatest impact.
So we have to ask ourselves:
What is the right question?
What would happen
if we fed ourselves more nutritious,
more sustainably grown food?
What would be the impact?
Cheryl Barbara,
Donna Martin,
Coach Parker and the Burke County Bears --
I think they know the answer.
Thank you guys so very much.
(Applause)
[This talk contains graphic images
Viewer discretion is advised]
I collect objects.
I collect branding irons that were used
to mark slaves as property.
I collect shackles for adults
and restraints for adults
as well as children.
I collect lynching postcards.
Yes, they depict lynchings.
They also depict the massive crowds
that attended these lynchings,
and they are postcards
that were also used for correspondence.
I collect proslavery books
that portray black people as criminals
or as animals without souls.
I brought you something today.
This is a ship's branding iron.
It was used to mark slaves.
Well, they actually were not slaves
when they were marked.
They were in Africa.
But they were marked with an "S"
to designate that they
were going to be slaves
when they were brought to the US
and when they were brought to Europe.
Another object or image that captured
my imagination when I was younger
was a Klan robe.
Growing up in South Carolina, I would see
Ku Klux Klan rallies occasionally,
actually more than occasionally,
and the memories of those events
never really left my mind.
And I didn't really do anything
with that imagery until 25 years later.
A few years ago,
I started researching the Klan,
the three distinct waves of the Klan,
the second one in particular.
The second wave of the Klan
had more than five million active members,
which was five percent
of the population at the time,
which was also the population
of New York City at the time.
The Klan robe factory in the Buckhead
neighborhood of Georgia was so busy
it became a 24-hour factory
to keep up with orders.
They kept 20,000 robes on hand at all time
to keep up with the demand.
As a collector of artifacts
and as an artist,
I really wanted a Klan robe
to be part of my collection,
because artifacts
and objects tell stories,
but I really couldn't find one
that was really good quality.
What is a black man to do in America
when he can't find the quality
Klan robe that he's looking for?
(Laughter)
So I had no other choice.
I decided I was going to make
the best quality Klan robes in America.
These are not your traditional Klan robes
you would see at any KKK rally.
I used kente cloth,
I used camouflage,
spandex, burlap, silks,
satins and different patterns.
I make them for different age groups;
I make them for young kids
as well as toddlers.
I even made one for an infant.
After making so many robes,
I realized that the policies
the Klan had in place
or wanted to have in place
a hundred years ago
are in place today.
We have segregated schools,
neighborhoods, workplaces,
and it's not the people wearing hoods
that are keeping these policies in place.
My work is about
the long-term impact of slavery.
We're not just dealing
with the residue of systemic racism.
It's the basis
of every single thing we do.
Again we have intentionally
segregated neighborhoods,
workplaces and schools.
We have voter suppression.
We have disproportionate representation
of minorities incarcerated.
We have environmental racism.
We have police brutality.
I brought you a few things today.
The stealth aspect of racism
is part of its power.
When you're discriminated against,
you can't always prove
you're being discriminated against.
Racism has the power to hide,
and when it hides, it's kept safe
because it blends in.
I created this robe to illustrate that.
The basis of capitalism
in America is slavery.
Slaves were the capital in capitalism.
The first Grand Wizard in 1868,
Nathan Bedford Forrest,
was a Confederate soldier
and a millionaire slave trader.
The wealth that was created
from chattel slavery --
that's slaves as property --
would boggle the mind.
Cotton sales alone in 1860
equalled 200 million dollars.
That would equal
five billion dollars today.
A lot of that wealth can be seen today
through generational wealth.
Oh, I forgot the other crops as well.
You have indigo, rice and tobacco.
In 2015, I made one robe a week
for the entire year.
After making 75 robes, I had an epiphany.
I have a realization
that white supremacy is there,
but the biggest force
of white supremacy is not the KKK,
it's the normalization of systemic racism.
There was something else I realized.
The robes had no more power
over me at all.
But if we as a people collectively
look at these objects --
branding irons, shackles, robes --
and realize that they
are part of our history,
we can find a way to where they have
no more power over us.
If we look at systemic racism
and acknowledge
that it's sown into the very fabric
of who we are as a country,
then we can actually do something
about the intentional segregation
in our schools,
neighborhoods and workplaces.
But then and only then
can we actually address
and confront this legacy of slavery
and dismantle this ugly legacy of slavery.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
My name is Joshua Walters.
I'm a performer.
(Beatboxing)
(Laughter)
(Applause)
But as far as being a performer,
I'm also diagnosed
bipolar.
I reframe that as a positive
because the crazier I get onstage,
the more entertaining I become.
When I was 16 in San Francisco,
I had my breakthrough manic episode
in which I thought I was Jesus Christ.
Maybe you thought that was scary,
but actually there's no amount of drugs you can take
that can get you as high
as if you think you're Jesus Christ.
(Laughter)
I was sent to a place,
a psych ward,
and in the psych ward,
everyone is doing their own one-man show.
(Laughter)
There's no audience like this
to justify their rehearsal time.
They're just practicing.
One day they'll get here.
Now when I got out,
I was diagnosed
and I was given medications
by a psychiatrist.
"Okay, Josh, why don't we give you some --
why don't we give you some Zyprexa.
Okay? Mmhmm?
At least that's what it says on my pen."
(Laughter)
Some of you are in the field, I can see.
I can feel your noise.
The first half of high school
was the struggle of the manic episode,
and the second half
was the overmedications of these drugs,
where I was sleeping through high school.
The second half was just one big nap, pretty much, in class.
When I got out
I had a choice.
I could either deny
my mental illness
or embrace
my mental skillness.
(Bugle sound)
There's a movement going on right now
to reframe mental illness as a positive --
at least the hypomanic edge part of it.
Now if you don't know what hypomania is,
it's like an engine that's out of control,
maybe a Ferrari engine, with no breaks.
Many of the speakers here, many of you in the audience,
have that creative edge,
if you know what I'm talking about.
You're driven to do something
that everyone has told you is impossible.
And there's a book -- John Gartner.
John Gartner wrote this book called "The Hypomanic Edge"
in which Christopher Columbus and Ted Turner and Steve Jobs
and all these business minds
have this edge to compete.
A different book was written not too long ago
in the mid-90s
called "Touched With Fire" by Kay Redfield Jamison
in which it was looked at in a creative sense
in which Mozart and Beethoven and Van Gogh
all have this manic depression that they were suffering with.
Some of them committed suicide.
So it wasn't all
the good side of the illness.
Now recently,
there's been development in this field.
And there was an article written in the New York Times,
September 2010,
that stated:
"Just Manic Enough."
Just be manic enough
in which investors who are looking for entrepreneurs
that have this kind of spectrum --
you know what I'm talking about --
not maybe full bipolar,
but they're in the bipolar spectrum --
where on one side,
maybe you think you're Jesus,
and on the other side
maybe they just make you a lot of money.
(Laughter)
Your call. Your call.
And everyone's somewhere in the middle.
Everyone's somewhere in the middle.
So maybe, you know,
there's no such thing
as crazy,
and being diagnosed with a mental illness
doesn't mean you're crazy.
But maybe it just means
you're more sensitive
to what most people can't see
or feel.
Maybe no one's really crazy.
Everyone is just a little bit mad.
How much
depends on where you fall in the spectrum.
How much
depends on how lucky you are.
Thank you.
(Applause)
I bring to you
a message from
tens of thousands of people --
in the villages, in the slums,
in the hinterland of the country --
who have solved problems
through their own genius,
without any
outside help.
When our home minister announces
a few weeks ago
a war on
one third of India,
about 200 districts that he mentioned
were ungovernable,
he missed the point.
The point that we have been stressing
for the last 21 years,
the point that
people may be economically poor,
but they're not poor in the mind.
In other words,
the minds on the margin
are not the marginal minds.
That is the message,
which we started 31 years ago.
And what did it start?
Let me just tell you, briefly, my personal journey,
which led me to come to this point.
In '85, '86, I was in Bangladesh
advising the government and the research council there
how to help scientists work on the lands,
on the fields of the poor people,
and how to develop research technologies,
which are based on the knowledge of the people.
I came back in '86.
I had been tremendously invigorated
by the knowledge and creativity that I found in that country,
which had 60 percent landlessness
but amazing creativity.
I started looking at my own work:
The work that I had done
for the previous 10 years,
almost every time,
had instances of knowledge
that people had shared.
Now, I was paid in dollars as a consultant,
and I looked at my income tax return
and tried to ask myself: "Is there a line in my return,
which shows how much of this income has gone
to the people whose knowledge
has made it possible?
Was it because I'm brilliant
that I'm getting this reward, or because of the revolution?
Is it that I write very well?
Is it that I articulate very well?
Is it that I analyze the data very well?
Is it because I'm a professor, and, therefore,
I must be entitled to this reward from society?"
I tried to convince myself that, "No, no,
I have worked for the policy changes.
You know, the public policy will become
more responsive to the needs of the poor,
and, therefore I think it's okay."
But it appeared to me
that all these years that I'd been working on exploitation --
exploitation by landlords,
by moneylenders, by traders --
gave me an insight that
probably I was also an exploiter,
because there was no line in my income tax return
which showed this income accrued
because of the brilliance of the people --
those people who have shared their knowledge and good faith and trust with me --
and nothing ever went back to them.
So much so, that much of my work till that time
was in the English language.
The majority of the people from whom I learned didn't know English.
So what kind of a contributor was I?
I was talking about social justice,
and here I was, a professional
who was pursuing the most unjust act --
of taking knowledge from the people, making them anonymous,
getting rent from that knowledge
by sharing it and doing consultancy, writing papers and
publishing them in the papers,
getting invited to the conferences,
getting consultancies and whatever have you.
So then, a dilemma rose in the mind that,
if I'm also an exploiter, then this is not right;
life cannot go on like that.
And this was a moment of great pain and trauma
because I couldn't live with it any longer.
So I did a review of
ethical dilemma and value conflicts and management research,
wrote, read about 100 papers.
And I came to the conclusion that
while dilemma is unique,
dilemma is not unique; the solution had to be unique.
And one day -- I don't know what happened --
while coming back from the office towards home,
maybe I saw a honey bee
or it occurred to my mind that if I only could be like the honey bee,
life would be wonderful.
What the honey bee does: it pollinates,
takes nectar from the flower,
pollinates another flower, cross-pollinates.
And when it takes the nectar,
the flowers don't feel shortchanged.
In fact, they invite the honey bees
through their colors,
and the bees don't keep all the honey for themselves.
These are the three guiding principles of the Honey Bee Network:
that whenever we learn something from people
it must be shared with them in their language.
They must not remain anonymous.
And I must tell you that after 20 years,
I have not made one percent of change
in the professional practice of this art.
That is a great tragedy -- which I'm carrying still with me
and I hope that all of you will carry this with you --
that the profession still legitimizes publication
of knowledge of people without attributing them
by making them anonymous.
The research guidelines of U.S. National Academy of Sciences
or Research Councils of the U.K.
or of Indian Councils of Science Research
do not require
that whatever you learn from people, you must share back with them.
We are talking about an accountable society,
a society that is fair and just,
and we don't even do justice in the knowledge market.
And India wants to be a knowledge society.
How will it be a knowledge society?
So, obviously, you cannot have two principles of justice,
one for yourself and one for others.
It must be the same.
You cannot discriminate.
You cannot be in favor of your own values,
which are at a distance from
the values that you espouse.
So, fairness to one and to the other
is not divisible.
Look at this picture.
Can you tell me where has it been taken from,
and what is it meant for? Anybody?
I'm a professor; I must quiz you. (Laughter)
Anybody? Any guess at all?
Pardon? (Audience Member: Rajasthan.)
Anil Gupta: But what has it been used for? What has it been used for?
(Murmuring)
Pardon?
You know, you're so right. We must give him a hand,
because this man knows how insensitive our government is.
Look at this. This is the site of the government of India.
It invites tourists
to see the shame of our country.
I'm so sorry to say that.
Is this a beautiful picture
or is it a terrible picture?
It depends upon how you look at the life of the people.
If this woman has to carry water on her head
for miles and miles and miles,
you cannot be celebrating that.
We should be doing something about it.
And let me tell you, with all the science and technology at our command,
millions of women still carry water on their heads.
And we do not ask this question.
You must have taken tea in the morning.
Think for a minute.
The leaves of the tea, plucked from the bushes;
you know what the action is? The action is:
The lady picks up a few leaves, puts them in the basket on the backside.
Just do it 10 times;
you will realize the pain in this shoulder.
And she does it a few thousand times
every day.
The rice that you ate in the lunch, and you will eat today,
is transplanted by women
bending in a very awkward posture,
millions of them,
every season, in the paddy season,
when they transplant paddy
with their feet in the water.
And feet in the water will develop fungus,
infections,
and that infection pains
because then other insects bite that point.
And every year,
99.9 percent of the paddy is transplanted manually.
No machines have been developed.
So the silence of scientists,
of technologists, of public policy makers,
of the change agent, drew our attention that this is not on, this is not on;
this is not the way society will work.
This is not what our parliament would do. You know,
we have a program for employment:
One hundred, 250 million people
have to be given jobs for 100 days by this great country.
Doing what? Breaking stones, digging earth.
So we asked a question to the parliament:
Do poor have heads?
Do poor have legs, mouth and hands, but no head?
So Honey Bee Network builds upon the resource in which poor people are rich.
And what has happened?
An anonymous, faceless, nameless person
gets in contact with the network,
and then gets an identity.
This is what Honey Bee Network is about.
And this network grew voluntarily,
continues to be voluntary,
and has tried to map the minds
of millions of people
of our country and other parts of the world who are creative.
They could be creative in terms of education,
they may be creative in terms of culture,
they may be creative in terms of institutions;
but a lot of our work is in the field of technological creativity,
the innovations,
either in terms of contemporary innovations,
or in terms of traditional knowledge.
And it all begins with curiosity.
It all begins with curiosity.
This person, whom we met -- and you will see it on the website,
www.sristi.org -- this tribal person,
he had a wish.
And he said, "If my wish gets fulfilled" --
somebody was sick and he had to monitor --
"God, please cure him.
And if you cure him, I will get my wall painted."
And this is what he got painted.
Somebody was talking yesterday about Maslowian hierarchy.
There could be nothing more wrong than
the Maslowian model of hierarchy of needs
because the poorest people in this country can get enlightenment.
Kabir, Rahim, all the great Sufi saints,
they were all poor people,
and they had a great reason. (Applause)
Please do not ever think that
only after meeting your physiological needs and other needs
can you be thinking about your spiritual needs or your enlightenment.
Any person anywhere is capable
of rising to that highest point of attainment,
only by the resolve that they have in their mind that they must achieve something.
Look at this.
We saw it in Shodh Yatra. Every six months we walk
in different parts of the country.
I've walked about 4,000 kilometers in the last 12 years.
So on the wayside
we found these dung cakes,
which are used as a fuel.
Now, this lady, on the wall of the dung cake heap,
has made a painting.
That's the only space she could express her creativity.
And she's so marvelous.
Look at this lady, Ram Timari Devi,
on a grain bin. In Champaran, we had a Shodh Yatra
and we were walking
in the land where Gandhiji went
to hear about the tragedy, pain
of indigo growers.
Bhabi Mahato in Purulia and Bankura.
Look at what she has done.
The whole wall is her canvas. She's sitting there with a broom.
Is she an artisan or an artist?
Obviously she's an artist; she's a creative person.
If we can create markets for these artists,
we will not have to employ them for digging earth and breaking stones.
They will be paid for what they are good at, not what they're bad at.
(Applause)
Look at what Rojadeen has done.
In Motihari in Champaran,
there are a lot of people who sell tea on the shack
and, obviously, there's a limited market for tea.
Every morning you have tea, as well as coffee.
So he thought, why don't I convert
a pressure cooker into a coffee machine?
So this is a coffee machine. Just takes a few hundred rupees.
People bring their own cooker,
he attaches a valve and a steam pipe,
and now he gives you espresso coffee. (Laughter)
Now, this is a real, affordable
coffee percolator that works on gas.
(Applause)
Look at what Sheikh Jahangir has done.
A lot of poor people do not have
enough grains to get ground.
So this fellow is bringing
a flour-grinding machine on a two-wheeler.
If you have 500 grams, 1000, one kilogram,
he will grind it for it for you; the flourmill will not grind such a small quantity.
Please understand the problem of poor people.
They have needs which
have to be met efficiently
in terms of energy, in terms of cost, in terms of quality.
They don't want second-standard, second-quality outputs.
But to be able to give them high-quality output
you need to adapt technology to their needs.
And that is what Sheikh Jahangir did.
But that's not enough, what he did. Look at what he did here.
If you have clothes, and you don't have enough time to wash them,
he brought a washing machine
to your doorstep, mounted on a two-wheeler.
So here's a model where
a two-wheeler washing machine ...
He is washing your clothes and drying them at your doorstep.
(Applause)
You bring your water, you bring your soap,
I wash the clothes for you. Charge 50 paisa, one rupee
for you per lot,
and a new business model can emerge.
Now, what we need is, we need
people who will be able to scale them up.
Look at this.
It looks like a beautiful photograph.
But you know what it is? Can anybody guess what it is?
Somebody from India would know, of course.
It's a tawa.
It's a hot plate made of clay.
Now, what is the beauty in it?
When you have a non-stick pan,
it costs about,
maybe, 250 rupees,
five dollars, six dollars.
This is less than a dollar
and this is non-stick;
it is coated with one of these
food-grade materials.
And the best part is that,
while you use a costly non-stick pan,
you eat the so-called Teflon
or Teflon-like material
because after some time the stuff disappears. Where has it gone?
It has gone in your stomach. It was not meant for that. (Laughter)
You know? But here
in this clay hot plate,
it will never go into your stomach.
So it is better, it is safer;
it is affordable, it is energy-efficient.
In other words, solutions by the poor people need not be cheaper,
need not be, so-called, jugaad, need not be some kind of makeshift arrangement.
They have to be better, they have to be more efficient,
they have to be affordable.
And that is what Mansukh Bhai Prajapati has done.
He has designed this plate with a handle.
And now with one dollar,
you can afford a better alternative
than the people market is offering you.
This lady, she developed
a herbal pesticide formulation.
We filed the patent for her,
the National Innovation Foundation.
And who knows? Somebody will license this technology
and develop marketable products,
and she would get revenue.
Now, let me mention one thing:
I think we need a polycentric model of development,
where a large number of initiatives in different parts of the country,
in different parts of the world,
would solve the needs of locality
in a very efficient and adaptive manner.
Higher the local fit,
greater is the chance of scaling up.
In the scaling up,
there's an inherent inadequacy
to match the needs of the local people,
point by point, with the supply that you're making.
So why are people willing to adjust with that mismatch?
Things can scale up, and they have scaled up.
For example, cell phones: We have 400 million cellphones in this country.
Now, it is possible that I use only two buttons on the cellphone,
only three options on the cellphone.
It has 300 options, I'm paying for 300; I'm using only three
but I'm willing to live with it, therefore it is scaling up.
But if I had to get a match to match,
obviously, I would need a different design of a cellphone.
So what we're saying is that scalability
should not become an enemy of sustainability.
There must be a place in the world
for solutions that are only relevant for a locality,
and yet, one can be able to fund them.
One of the greatest studies that we've been finding is
that many times investors would ask this question --
"What is a scalable model?" --
as if the need of a community, which is only
located in a space and time
and has those needs only located in those places,
has no legitimate right to get them for free
because it's not part of a larger scale.
So either you sub-optimize your needs to a larger scale
or else you remain out.
Now, the eminent model, the long-tail model
tells you that small sales
of a large number of books, for example,
having only a few copies sold
can still be a viable model.
And we must find a mechanism where
people will pool in the portfolio, will invest in the portfolio,
where different innovations will go to
a small number of people in their localities,
and yet, the overall platform of the model will become viable.
Look at what he is doing.
Saidullah Sahib is an amazing man.
At the age of 70,
he is linking up something very creative.
(Music)
Saidullah Sahib: I couldn't wait for the boat.
I had to meet my love.
My desperation made me an innovator.
Even love needs help from technology.
Innovation is the light of my wife, Noor.
New inventions are the passion of my life.
My technology.
(Applause)
AG: Saidulluh Sahib is
in Motihari, again in Champaran.
Wonderful human being,
but he stills sells, at this age,
honey on a cycle to earn his livelihood,
because we haven't been able to convince the water park people,
the lake people, in [unclear] operations.
And we have not been able to convince the fire brigade people
in Mumbai -- where there was a flood a few years ago
and people had to walk 20 kilometers, wading in the water --
that, look, you should have this cycle in your fire brigade office
because you can then go to those lanes
where your buses will not go, where your transport will not go.
So we have not yet cracked the problem
of making it available as a rescue device,
as a vending device during the floods in eastern India,
when you have to deliver things to people
in different islands
where they're marooned.
But the idea has a merit. The idea has a merit.
What has Appachan done? Appachan, unfortunately, is no more,
but he has left behind a message.
A very powerful message
Appachan: I watch the world wake up every day.
(Music)
It's not that a coconut fell on my head,
and I came upon this idea.
With no money to fund my studies,
I scaled new heights.
Now, they call me the local Spiderman.
My technology.
(Applause)
AG: Many of you
might not realize and believe
that we have sold this product internationally --
what I call a G2G model,
grassroots to global.
And a professor in the University of Massachusetts,
in the zoology department,
bought this climber because she wanted
to study the insect diversity
of the top of the tree canopy.
And this device makes it possible
for her to take samples from a larger number of palms,
rather than only a few,
because otherwise she had to make a big platform
and then climb her [unclear] would climb on that.
So, you know, we are advancing the frontiers of science.
Remya Jose has developed ...
you can go to the YouTube and find India Innovates
and then you will find these videos.
Innovation by her when she was in class 10th:
a washing machine-cum-exercising machine.
Mr. Kharai who is a physically challenged person,
one and a half foot height, only.
But he has modified a two-wheeler so that he can get autonomy
and freedom and flexibility.
This innovation is from the slums of Rio.
And this person, Mr. Ubirajara.
We were talking about, my friends in Brazil,
how we scale up this model in China and Brazil.
And we have a very vibrant network in China, particularly,
but also emerging in Brazil and other parts of the world.
This stand on the front wheel, you will not find on any cycle.
India and China have the largest number of cycles.
But this innovation emerged in Brazil.
The point is, none of us should be parochial,
none of us should be so nationalistic to believe
that all good ideas will come only from our country.
No, we have to have the humility to learn
from knowledge of economically poor people, wherever they are.
And look at this whole range of cycle-based innovations:
cycle that's a sprayer, cycle that
generates energy from the shocks on the road.
I can't change the condition of the road,
but I can make the cycle run faster.
That is what Kanak Das has done.
And in South Africa,
we had taken our innovators,
and many of us had gone there share with the colleagues in South Africa
as to how innovation can become
a means of liberation
from the drudgery that people have.
And this is a donkey cart which they modified.
There's an axle here, of 30, 40 kg,
serving no purpose.
Remove it, the cart needs one donkey less.
This is in China. This girl needed a breathing apparatus.
These three people in the village
sat down and decided to think,
"How do we elongate the life of this girl of our village?"
They were not related to her, but they tried to find out,
"How can we use ... "
They used a cycle, they put together a breathing apparatus.
And this breathing apparatus now saved the life,
and she's very welcome.
There's a whole range of innovations that we have.
A car, which runs on compressed air
with six paisa per kilometer.
Assam, Kanak Gogoi.
And you would not find this car in U.S. or Europe,
but this is available in India.
Now, this lady, she used to do the winding of the yarn
for Pochampally Saree.
In one day, 18,000 times,
she had to do this winding
to generate two sarees.
This is what her son has done after seven years of struggle.
She said, "Change your profession."
He said, "I can't. This is the only thing I know, but I'll invent a machine,
which will solve your problem."
And this is what he did, a sewing machine in Uttar Pradesh.
So, this is what SRISTI is saying:
"Give me a place to stand, and I will move the world."
I will just tell you that we are also doing a competition among children
for creativity, a whole range of things.
We have sold things all over the world,
from Ethiopia to Turkey to U.S. to wherever.
Products have gone to the market, a few.
These are the people whose knowledge made
this Herbavate cream for eczema possible.
And here, a company which licensed this herbal pesticide
put a photograph of the innovator on the packing
so that every time a user uses it,
it asks the user, "You can also be an innovator.
If you have an idea, send it back to us."
So, creativity counts, knowledge matters,
innovations transform, incentives inspire.
And incentives: not just material, but also non-material incentives.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Hello.
I'm a toy developer.
With a dream of creating new toys
that have never been seen before,
I began working at a toy company
nine years ago.
When I first started working there,
I proposed many new ideas
to my boss every day.
However, my boss always asked
if I had the data to prove it would sell,
and asked me to think of product
development after analyzing market data.
Data, data, data.
So I analyzed the market data
before thinking of a product.
However, I was unable to think
of anything new at that moment.
(Laughter)
My ideas were unoriginal.
I wasn't getting any new ideas
and I grew tired of thinking.
It was so hard that I became this skinny.
(Laughter)
It's true.
(Applause)
You've all probably had
similar experiences and felt this way too.
Your boss was being difficult.
The data was difficult.
You become sick of thinking.
Now, I throw out the data.
It's my dream to create new toys.
And now, instead of data,
I'm using a game called Shiritori
to come up with new ideas.
I would like to introduce
this method today.
What is Shiritori?
Take apple, elephant 
and trumpet, for example.
It's a game where 
you take turns saying words
that start with the last letter
of the previous word.
It's the same in Japanese and English.
You can play Shiritori as you like:
"neko, kora, raibu, burashi," etc, etc.
[Cat, cola, concert, brush]
Many random words will come out.
You force those words to connect to what
you want to think of and form ideas.
In my case, for example,
since I want to think of toys,
what could a toy cat be?
A cat that lands after doing
a somersault from a high place?
How about a toy with cola?
A toy gun where you shoot cola
and get someone soaking wet?
(Laughter)
Ridiculous ideas are okay.
The key is to keep them flowing.
The more ideas you produce, you're sure
to come up with some good ones, too.
A brush, for example.
Can we make a toothbrush into a toy?
We could combine
a toothbrush with a guitar and --
(Music noises) --
you've got a toy you can play with
while brushing your teeth.
(Laughter) (Applause)
Kids who don't like to brush
their teeth might begin to like it.
Can we make a hat into a toy?
How about something like a roulette game,
where you try the hat on one by one,
and then, when someone puts it on,
a scary alien breaks through the top
screaming, "Ahh!"
I wonder if there would be
a demand for this at parties?
Ideas that didn't come out while you stare
at the data will start to come out.
Actually, this bubble wrap,
which is used to pack fragile objects,
combined with a toy,
made Mugen Pop Pop,
a toy where you can pop
the bubbles as much as you like.
It was a big hit when it reached stores.
Data had nothing to do with its success.
Although it's only popping bubbles,
it's a great way to kill time,
so please pass this around
amongst yourselves today and play with it.
(Applause)
Anyway, you continue to come up with
useless ideas.
Think up many trivial ideas, everyone.
If you base your ideas on data analysis
and know what you're aiming for,
you'll end up trying too hard,
and you can't produce new ideas.
Even if you know what your aim is,
think of ideas as freely as if you were
throwing darts with your eyes closed.
If you do this, you surely will hit
somewhere near the center.
At least one will.
That's the one you should choose.
If you do so, that idea will be in demand
and, moreover, it will be brand new.
That is how I think of new ideas.
It doesn't have to be Shiritori;
there are many different methods.
You just have to choose words at random.
You can flip through a dictionary
and choose words at random.
For example, you could look up two
random letters and gather the results
or go to the store
and connect product names
with what you want to think of.
The point is to gather random words,
not information from the category
you're thinking for.
If you do this, the ingredients for
the association of ideas are collected
and form connections
that will produce many ideas.
The greatest advantage to this method
is the continuous flow of images.
Because you're thinking
of one word after another,
the image of the previous word
is still with you.
That image will automatically
be related with future words.
Unconsciously, a concert will
be connected to a brush
and a roulette game
will be connected to a hat.
You wouldn't even realize it.
You can come up with ideas that
you wouldn't have thought of otherwise.
This method is, of course,
not just for toys.
You can collect ideas for books, apps,
events, and many other projects.
I hope you all try this method.
There are futures that are born from data.
However, using this silly game
called Shiritori,
I look forward to
the exciting future you will create,
a future you couldn't even imagine.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
Forrest North: The beginning of any collaboration
starts with a conversation.
And I would like to share with you
some of the bits of the conversation that we started with.
I grew up in a log cabin in Washington state
with too much time on my hands.
Yves Behar: And in scenic Switzerland for me.
FN: I always had a passion for alternative vehicles.
This is a land yacht racing across the desert in Nevada.
YB: Combination of windsurfing and skiing into this invention there.
FN: And I also had an interest in dangerous inventions.
This is a 100,000-volt Tesla coil
that I built in my bedroom,
much to the dismay of my mother.
YB: To the dismay of my mother,
this is dangerous teenage fashion right there.
(Laughter)
FN: And I brought this all together,
this passion with alternative energy and raced a solar car across Australia --
also the U.S. and Japan.
YB: So, wind power, solar power -- we had a lot to talk about.
We had a lot that got us excited.
So we decided to do a special project together.
To combine engineering and design and ...
FN: Really make a fully integrated product, something beautiful.
YB: And we made a baby.
(Laughter)
FN: Can you bring out our baby?
(Applause)
This baby is fully electric.
It goes 150 miles an hour.
It's twice the range of any electric motorcycle.
Really the exciting thing about a motorcycle
is just the beautiful integration of engineering and design.
It's got an amazing user experience.
It was wonderful working with Yves Behar.
He came up with our name and logo. We're Mission Motors.
And we've only got three minutes,
but we could talk about it for hours.
YB: Thank you.
FN: Thank you TED. And thank you Chris, for having us.
(Applause)
I'm driven by pure passion
to create photographs that tell stories.
Photography can be described
as the recording of a single moment
frozen within a fraction of time.
Each moment or photograph
represents a tangible piece
of our memories as time passes.
But what if you could capture more
than one moment in a photograph?
What if a photograph
could actually collapse time,
compressing the best moments
of the day and the night
seamlessly into one single image?
I've created a concept
called "Day to Night"
and I believe it's going to change
the way you look at the world.
I know it has for me.
My process begins by photographing
iconic locations,
places that are part of what I call
our collective memory.
I photograph from a fixed vantage point,
and I never move.
I capture the fleeting moments
of humanity and light as time passes.
Photographing for anywhere
from 15 to 30 hours
and shooting over 1,500 images,
I then choose the best moments
of the day and night.
Using time as a guide,
I seamlessly blend those best moments
into one single photograph,
visualizing our conscious
journey with time.
I can take you to Paris
for a view from the Tournelle Bridge.
And I can show you the
early morning rowers
along the River Seine.
And simultaneously,
I can show you Notre Dame aglow at night.
And in between, I can show you
the romance of the City of Light.
I am essentially a street photographer
from 50 feet in the air,
and every single thing you see
in this photograph
actually happened on this day.
Day to Night is a global project,
and my work has always been about history.
I'm fascinated by the concept
of going to a place like Venice
and actually seeing it during
a specific event.
And I decided I wanted to see
the historical Regata,
an event that's actually been
taking place since 1498.
The boats and the costumes
look exactly as they did then.
And an important element that I really
want you guys to understand is:
this is not a timelapse,
this is me photographing
throughout the day and the night.
I am a relentless collector
of magical moments.
And the thing that drives me
is the fear of just missing one of them.
The entire concept came about in 1996.
LIFE Magazine commissioned me
to create a panoramic photograph
of the cast and crew of Baz Luhrmann's
film Romeo + Juliet.
I got to the set and realized:
it's a square.
So the only way I could actually create
a panoramic was to shoot a collage
of 250 single images.
So I had DiCaprio and Claire Danes
embracing.
And as I pan my camera to the right,
I noticed there was a mirror on the wall
and I saw they were
actually reflecting in it.
And for that one moment, that one image
I asked them, "Would you guys just kiss
for this one picture?"
And then I came back
to my studio in New York,
and I hand-glued these 250 images together
and stood back and went,
"Wow, this is so cool!
I'm changing time in a photograph."
And that concept actually
stayed with me for 13 years
until technology finally
has caught up to my dreams.
This is an image I created
of the Santa Monica Pier, Day to Night.
And I'm going to show you a little video
that gives you an idea of what
it's like being with me
when I do these pictures.
To start with, you have to understand
that to get views like this,
most of my time is spent up high,
and I'm usually in a cherry picker
or a crane.
So this is a typical day,
12-18 hours, non-stop
capturing the entire day unfold.
One of the things that's great
is I love to people-watch.
And trust me when I tell you,
this is the greatest seat
in the house to have.
But this is really how I go about
creating these photographs.
So once I decide on my view
and the location,
I have to decide where day begins
and night ends.
And that's what I call the time vector.
Einstein described time as a fabric.
Think of the surface of a trampoline:
it warps and stretches with gravity.
I see time as a fabric as well,
except I take that fabric and flatten it,
compress it into single plane.
One of the unique aspects
of this work is also,
if you look at all my pictures,
the time vector changes:
sometimes I'll go left to right,
sometimes front to back,
up or down, even diagonally.
I am exploring the space-time continuum
within a two-dimensional still photograph.
Now when I do these pictures,
it's literally like a real-time puzzle
going on in my mind.
I build a photograph based on time,
and this is what I call the master plate.
This can take us several
months to complete.
The fun thing about this work is
I have absolutely zero control
when I get up there
on any given day and capture photographs.
So I never know who's
going to be in the picture,
if it's going to be a great
sunrise or sunset -- no control.
It's at the end of the process,
if I've had a really great day
and everything remained the same,
that I then decide who's in and who's out,
and it's all based on time.
I'll take those best moments that I pick
over a month of editing
and they get seamlessly blended
into the master plate.
I'm compressing the day and night
as I saw it,
creating a unique harmony between
these two very discordant worlds.
Painting has always been a really
important influence in all my work
and I've always been a huge fan
of Albert Bierstadt,
the great Hudson River School painter.
He inspired a recent series
that I did on the National Parks.
This is Bierstadt's Yosemite Valley.
So this is the photograph
I created of Yosemite.
This is actually the cover story
of the 2016 January issue
of National Geographic.
I photographed for over
30 hours in this picture.
I was literally on the side of a cliff,
capturing the stars
and the moonlight as it transitions,
the moonlight lighting El Capitan.
And I also captured this transition
of time throughout the landscape.
The best part is obviously seeing
the magical moments of humanity
as time changed --
from day into night.
And on a personal note,
I actually had a photocopy
of Bierstadt's painting in my pocket.
And when that sun started
to rise in the valley,
I started to literally shake
with excitement
because I looked at the painting and I go,
"Oh my god, I'm getting Bierstadt's
exact same lighting
100 years earlier."
Day to Night is about all the things,
it's like a compilation of all
the things I love
about the medium of photography.
It's about landscape,
it's about street photography,
it's about color, it's about architecture,
perspective, scale --
and, especially, history.
This is one of the most historical moments
I've been able to photograph,
the 2013 Presidential Inauguration
of Barack Obama.
And if you look closely in this picture,
you can actually see time changing
in those large television sets.
You can see Michelle
waiting with the children,
the president now greets the crowd,
he takes his oath,
and now he's speaking to the people.
There's so many challenging aspects
when I create photographs like this.
For this particular photograph,
I was in a 50-foot scissor lift
up in the air
and it was not very stable.
So every time my assistant and I
shifted our weight,
our horizon line shifted.
So for every picture you see,
and there were about
1,800 in this picture,
we both had to tape our feet into position
every time I clicked the shutter.
(Applause)
I've learned so many extraordinary
things doing this work.
I think the two most important
are patience
and the power of observation.
When you photograph a city
like New York from above,
I discovered that those people in cars
that I sort of live with everyday,
they don't look like people
in cars anymore.
They feel like a giant school of fish,
it was a form of emergent behavior.
And when people describe
the energy of New York,
I think this photograph begins
to really capture that.
When you look closer in my work,
you can see there's stories going on.
You realize that Times Square is a canyon,
it's shadow and it's sunlight.
So I decided, in this photograph,
I would checkerboard time.
So wherever the shadows are, it's night
and wherever the sun is,
it's actually day.
Time is this extraordinary thing
that we never can really
wrap our heads around.
But in a very unique and special way,
I believe these photographs
begin to put a face on time.
They embody a new
metaphysical visual reality.
When you spend 15 hours
looking at a place,
you're going to see things
a little differently
than if you or I walked up
with our camera,
took a picture, and then walked away.
This was a perfect example.
I call it "Sacré-Coeur Selfie."
I watched over 15 hours
all these people
not even look at Sacré-Coeur.
They were more interested
in using it as a backdrop.
They would walk up, take a picture,
and then walk away.
And I found this to be an absolutely
extraordinary example,
a powerful disconnect between
what we think the human experience is
versus what the human experience
is evolving into.
The act of sharing has suddenly
become more important
than the experience itself.
(Applause)
And finally, my most recent image,
which has such a special meaning
for me personally:
this is the Serengeti National
Park in Tanzania.
And this is photographed
in the middle of the Seronera,
this is not a reserve.
I went specifically during
the peak migration
to hopefully capture
the most diverse range of animals.
Unfortunately, when we got there,
there was a drought going on
during the peak migration,
a five-week drought.
So all the animals
were drawn to the water.
I found this one watering hole,
and felt if everything remained
the same way it was behaving,
I had a real opportunity
to capture something unique.
We spent three days studying it,
and nothing could have prepared me
for what I witnessed during our shoot day.
I photographed for 26 hours
in a sealed crocodile blind,
18 feet in the air.
What I witnessed was unimaginable.
Frankly, it was Biblical.
We saw, for 26 hours,
all these competitive species
share a single resource called water.
The same resource that humanity
is supposed to have wars over
during the next 50 years.
The animals never even
grunted at each other.
They seem to understand something
that we humans don't.
That this precious resource called water
is something we all have to share.
When I created this picture,
I realized that Day to Night
is really a new way of seeing,
compressing time,
exploring the space-time continuum
within a photograph.
As technology evolves
along with photography,
photographs will not only communicate
a deeper meaning of time and memory,
but they will compose a new narrative
of untold stories,
creating a timeless window into our world.
Thank you.
(Applause)
I've been doing some thinking.
I'm going to kill my dad.
I called my sister.
"Listen,
I've been doing some thinking.
I'm going to kill Dad.
I'm going to take him to Oregon,
find some heroin,
and give it to him."
My dad has frontotemporal lobe dementia,
or FTD.
It's a confusing disease
that hits people in their 50s or 60s.
It can completely change
someone's personality,
making them paranoid and even violent.
My dad's been sick for a decade,
but three years ago he got really sick,
and we had to move him out of his house --
the house that I grew up in,
the house that he built
with his own hands.
My strapping, cool dad
with the falsetto singing voice
had to move into a facility
for round-the-clock care
when he was just 65.
At first my mom and sisters
and I made the mistake
of putting him in a regular nursing home.
It was really pretty;
it had plush carpet
and afternoon art classes
and a dog named Diane.
But then I got a phone call.
"Ms. Malone, we've arrested your father."
"What?"
"Well, he threatened
everybody with cutlery.
And then he yanked
the curtains off the wall,
and then he tried
to throw plants out the window.
And then, well, he pulled all
the old ladies out of their wheelchairs."
"All the old ladies?"
(Laughter)
"What a cowboy."
(Laughter)
After he got kicked out of there,
we bounced him between
a bunch of state-run facilities
before finding a treatment center
specifically for people with dementia.
At first, he kind of liked it,
but over time his health declined,
and one day I walked in
and found him sitting hunched over
on the ground wearing a onesie --
those kinds of outfits
that zip in the back.
I watched him for about an hour
as he yanked at it,
trying to find a way out of this thing.
And it's supposed to be practical,
but to me it looked like a straightjacket.
And so I ran out.
I left him there.
I sat in my truck -- his old truck --
hunched over,
this really deep guttural cry
coming out of the pit of my belly.
I just couldn't believe that my father,
the Adonis of my youth,
my really dear friend,
would think that this kind of life
was worth living anymore.
We're programmed
to prioritize productivity.
So when a person --
an Adonis in this case --
is no longer productive
in the way we expect him to be,
the way that he expects himself to be,
what value does that life have left?
That day in the truck,
all I could imagine
was that my dad was being tortured
and his body was
the vessel of that torture.
I've got to get him out of that body.
I've got to get him out of that body;
I'm going to kill Dad.
I call my sister.
"Beth," she said.
"You don't want
to live the rest of your life
knowing that you killed your father.
And you'd be arrested I think,
because he can't condone it.
And you don't even know
how to buy heroin."
(Laughter)
It's true, I don't.
(Laughter)
The truth is we talk
about his death a lot.
When will it happen? What will it be like?
But I wish that we would have talked
about death when we were all healthy.
What does my best death look like?
What does your best death look like?
But my family didn't know to do that.
And my sister was right.
I shouldn't murder Dad with heroin,
but I've got to get him out of that body.
So I went to a psychic.
And then a priest,
and then a support group,
and they all said the same thing:
sometimes people hang on
when they're worried about loved ones.
Just tell them you're safe,
and it's OK to go when you're ready.
So I went to see Dad.
I found him hunched over
on the ground in the onesie.
He was staring past me
and just kind of looking at the ground.
I gave him a ginger ale
and just started talking
about nothing in particular,
but as I was talking,
he sneezed from the ginger ale.
And the sneeze --
it jerked his body upright,
sparking him back to life a little bit.
And he just kept drinking and sneezing
and sparking, over and over and over again
until it stopped.
And I heard,
"Heheheheheh,
heheheheheh ...
this is so fabulous.
This is so fabulous."
His eyes were open
and he was looking at me,
and I said, "Hi, Dad!"
and he said, "Hiya, Beth."
And I opened my mouth to tell him, right?
"Dad, if you want to die, you can die.
We're all OK."
But as I opened my mouth to tell him,
all I could say was, "Dad!
I miss you."
And then he said, "Well, I miss you, too."
And then I just fell over
because I'm just a mess.
So I fell over and I sat there with him
because for the first time in a long time
he seemed kind of OK.
And I memorized his hands,
feeling so grateful that his spirit
was still attached to his body.
And in that moment I realized
I'm not responsible for this person.
I'm not his doctor,
I'm not his mother,
I'm certainly not his God,
and maybe the best way to help him and me
is to resume our roles
as father and daughter.
And so we just sat there,
calm and quiet like we've always done.
Nobody was productive.
Both of us are still strong.
"OK, Dad. I'm going to go,
but I'll see you tomorrow."
"OK," he said.
"Hey,
this is a pretty nice hacienda."
Thank you.
(Applause)
Well, I'm involved in other things, besides physics.
In fact, mostly now in other things.
One thing is distant relationships among human languages.
And the professional, historical linguists in the U.S.
and in Western Europe mostly try to stay away
from any long-distance relationships, big groupings,
groupings that go back a long time,
longer than the familiar families.
They don't like that. They think it's crank. I don't think it's crank.
And there are some brilliant linguists, mostly Russians,
who are working on that, at Santa Fe Institute and in Moscow,
and I would love to see where that leads.
Does it really lead to a single ancestor
some 20, 25,000 years ago?
And what if we go back beyond that single ancestor,
when there was presumably a competition among many languages?
How far back does that go? How far back does modern language go?
How many tens of thousands of years does it go back?
Chris Anderson: Do you have a hunch or a hope for what the answer to that is?
Murray Gell-Mann: Well, I would guess that modern language must be older
than the cave paintings and cave engravings and cave sculptures
and dance steps in the soft clay in the caves in Western Europe,
in the Aurignacian Period some 35,000 years ago, or earlier.
I can't believe they did all those things and didn't also have a modern language.
So, I would guess that the actual origin goes back at least that far and maybe further.
But that doesn't mean that all, or many, or most
of today's attested languages couldn't descend perhaps
from one that's much younger than that, like say 20,000 years,
or something of that kind. It's what we call a bottleneck.
CA: Well, Philip Anderson may have been right.
You may just know more about everything than anyone.
So, it's been an honor. Thank you Murray Gell-Mann.
(Applause)
How many companies
have you interacted with today?
Well, you got up in the morning,
took a shower,
washed your hair,
used a hair dryer,
ate breakfast --
ate cereals, fruit, yogurt, whatever --
had coffee --
tea.
You took public transport to come here,
or maybe used your private car.
You interacted with the company
that you work for or that you own.
You interacted with your clients,
your customers,
and so on and so forth.
I'm pretty sure there are
at least seven companies
you've interacted with today.
Let me tell you a stunning statistic.
One out of seven
large, public corporations
commit fraud every year.
This is a US academic study
that looks at US companies --
I have no reason to believe
that it's different in Europe.
This is a study that looks
at both detected and undetected fraud
using statistical methods.
This is not petty fraud.
These frauds cost
the shareholders of these companies,
and therefore society,
on the order of
380 billion dollars per year.
We can all think of some examples, right?
The car industry's secrets
aren't quite so secret anymore.
Fraud has become a feature,
not a bug,
of the financial services industry.
That's not me who's claiming that,
that's the president
of the American Finance Association
who stated that
in his presidential address.
That's a huge problem
if you think about, especially,
an economy like Switzerland,
which relies so much on the trust
put into its financial industry.
On the other hand,
there are six out of seven companies
who actually remain honest
despite all temptations
to start engaging in fraud.
There are whistle-blowers
like Michael Woodford,
who blew the whistle on Olympus.
These whistle-blowers risk their careers,
their friendships,
to bring out the truth
about their companies.
There are journalists
like Anna Politkovskaya
who risk even their lives
to report human rights violations.
She got killed --
every year,
around 100 journalists get killed
because of their conviction
to bring out the truth.
So in my talk today,
I want to share with you
some insights I've obtained and learned
in the last 10 years
of conducting research in this.
I'm a researcher,
a scientist working with economists,
financial economists,
ethicists, neuroscientists,
lawyers and others
trying to understand
what makes humans tick,
and how can we address this issue
of fraud in corporations
and therefore contribute
to the improvement of the world.
I want to start by sharing with you
two very distinct visions
of how people behave.
First, meet Adam Smith,
founding father of modern economics.
His basic idea was that if everybody
behaves in their own self-interests,
that's good for everybody in the end.
Self-interest isn't
a narrowly defined concept
just for your immediate utility.
It has a long-run implication.
Let's think about that.
Think about this dog here.
That might be us.
There's this temptation --
I apologize to all vegetarians, but --
(Laughter)
Dogs do like the bratwurst.
(Laughter)
Now, the straight-up,
self-interested move here
is to go for that.
So my friend Adam here might jump up,
get the sausage and thereby ruin
all this beautiful tableware.
But that's not what Adam Smith meant.
He didn't mean
disregard all consequences --
to the contrary.
He would have thought,
well, there may be negative consequences,
for example,
the owner might be angry with the dog
and the dog, anticipating that,
might not behave in this way.
That might be us,
weighing the benefits
and costs of our actions.
How does that play out?
Well, many of you, I'm sure,
have in your companies,
especially if it's a large company,
a code of conduct.
And then if you behave
according to that code of conduct,
that improves your chances
of getting a bonus payment.
And on the other hand,
if you disregard it,
then there are higher chances
of not getting your bonus
or its being diminished.
In other words,
this is a very economic motivation
of trying to get people to be more honest,
or more aligned with
the corporation's principles.
Similarly, reputation is a very
powerful economic force, right?
We try to build a reputation,
maybe for being honest,
because then people
trust us more in the future.
Right?
Adam Smith talked about the baker
who's not producing good bread
out of his benevolence
for those people who consume the bread,
but because he wants to sell
more future bread.
In my research, we find, for example,
at the University of Zurich,
that Swiss banks
who get caught up in media,
and in the context, for example,
of tax evasion, of tax fraud,
have bad media coverage.
They lose net new money in the future
and therefore make lower profits.
That's a very powerful reputational force.
Benefits and costs.
Here's another viewpoint of the world.
Meet Immanuel Kant,
18th-century German philosopher superstar.
He developed this notion
that independent of the consequences,
some actions are just right
and some are just wrong.
It's just wrong to lie, for example.
So, meet my friend Immanuel here.
He knows that the sausage is very tasty,
but he's going to turn away
because he's a good dog.
He knows it's wrong to jump up
and risk ruining
all this beautiful tableware.
If you believe that people
are motivated like that,
then all the stuff about incentives,
all the stuff about code of conduct
and bonus systems and so on,
doesn't make a whole lot of sense.
People are motivated
by different values perhaps.
So, what are people actually motivated by?
These two gentlemen here
have perfect hairdos,
but they give us
very different views of the world.
What do we do with this?
Well, I'm an economist
and we conduct so-called experiments
to address this issue.
We strip away facts
which are confusing in reality.
Reality is so rich,
there is so much going on,
it's almost impossible to know
what drives people's behavior really.
So let's do a little experiment together.
Imagine the following situation.
You're in a room alone,
not like here.
There's a five-franc coin
like the one I'm holding up right now
in front of you.
Here are your instructions:
toss the coin four times,
and then on a computer
terminal in front of you,
enter the number of times tails came up.
This is the situation.
Here's the rub.
For every time that you announce
that you had a tails throw,
you get paid five francs.
So if you say I had two tails throws,
you get paid 10 francs.
If you say you had zero,
you get paid zero francs.
If you say, "I had four tails throws,"
then you get paid 20 francs.
It's anonymous,
nobody's watching what you're doing,
and you get paid that money anonymously.
I've got two questions for you.
(Laughter)
You know what's coming now, right?
First, how would you behave
in that situation?
The second, look to your left
and look to your right --
(Laughter)
and think about how
the person sitting next to you
might behave in that situation.
We did this experiment for real.
We did it at the Manifesta art exhibition
that took place here in Zurich recently,
not with students in the lab
at the university
but with the real population,
like you guys.
First, a quick reminder of stats.
If I throw the coin four times
and it's a fair coin,
then the probability
that it comes up four times tails
is 6.25 percent.
And I hope you can intuitively see
that the probability that all four
of them are tails is much lower
than if two of them are tails, right?
Here are the specific numbers.
Here's what happened.
People did this experiment for real.
Around 30 to 35 percent of people said,
"Well, I had four tails throws."
That's extremely unlikely.
(Laughter)
But the really amazing thing here,
perhaps to an economist,
is there are around 65 percent of people
who did not say I had four tails throws,
even though in that situation,
nobody's watching you,
the only consequence that's in place
is you get more money
if you say four than less.
You leave 20 francs on the table
by announcing zero.
I don't know whether
the other people all were honest
or whether they also said a little bit
higher or lower than what they did
because it's anonymous.
We only observed the distribution.
But what I can tell you --
and here's another coin toss.
There you go, it's tails.
(Laughter)
Don't check, OK?
(Laughter)
What I can tell you
is that not everybody behaved
like Adam Smith would have predicted.
So what does that leave us with?
Well, it seems people are motivated
by certain intrinsic values
and in our research, we look at this.
We look at the idea that people have
so-called protected values.
A protected value isn't just any value.
A protected value is a value
where you're willing to pay a price
to uphold that value.
You're willing to pay a price
to withstand the temptation to give in.
And the consequence is you feel better
if you earn money in a way
that's consistent with your values.
Let me show you this again
in the metaphor of our beloved dog here.
If we succeed in getting the sausage
without violating our values,
then the sausage tastes better.
That's what our research shows.
If, on the other hand,
we do so --
if we get the sausage
and in doing so
we actually violate values,
we value the sausage less.
Quantitatively, that's quite powerful.
We can measure these protected values,
for example,
by a survey measure.
Simple, nine-item survey that's quite
predictive in these experiments.
If you think about the average
of the population
and then there's
a distribution around it --
people are different,
we all are different.
People who have a set of protected values
that's one standard deviation
above the average,
they discount money they receive
by lying by about 25 percent.
That means a dollar received when lying
is worth to them only 75 cents
without any incentives you put in place
for them to behave honestly.
It's their intrinsic motivation.
By the way, I'm not a moral authority.
I'm not saying I have
all these beautiful values, right?
But I'm interested in how people behave
and how we can leverage
that richness in human nature
to actually improve
the workings of our organizations.
So there are two
very, very different visions here.
On the one hand,
you can appeal to benefits and costs
and try to get people
to behave according to them.
On the other hand,
you can select people who have the values
and the desirable
characteristics, of course --
competencies that go
in line with your organization.
I do not yet know where
these protected values really come from.
Is it nurture or is it nature?
What I can tell you
is that the distribution
looks pretty similar for men and women.
It looks pretty similar
for those who had studied economics
or those who had studied psychology.
It looks even pretty similar
around different age categories
among adults.
But I don't know yet
how this develops over a lifetime.
That will be the subject
of future research.
The idea I want to leave you with
is it's all right to appeal to incentives.
I'm an economist;
I certainly believe in the fact
that incentives work.
But do think about selecting
the right people
rather than having people
and then putting incentives in place.
Selecting the right people
with the right values
may go a long way
to saving a lot of trouble
and a lot of money
in your organizations.
In other words,
it will pay off to put people first.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Imagine a big explosion
as you climb through 3,000 ft.
Imagine a plane full of smoke.
Imagine an engine
going clack, clack, clack.
It sounds scary.
Well, I had a unique seat that day.
I was sitting in 1D.
I was the only one who could talk
to the flight attendants.
So I looked at them right away,
and they said, "No problem.
We probably hit some birds."
The pilot had already
turned the plane around,
and we weren't that far.
You could see Manhattan.
Two minutes later,
three things happened at the same time.
The pilot lines up the plane
with the Hudson River.
That's usually not the route.
(Laughter)
He turns off the engines.
Now, imagine being
in a plane with no sound.
And then he says three words.
The most unemotional
three words I've ever heard.
He says, "Brace for impact."
I didn't have to talk
to the flight attendant anymore.
(Laughter)
I could see in her eyes, it was terror.
Life was over.
Now I want to share with you three things
I learned about myself that day.
I learned that it
all changes in an instant.
We have this bucket list,
we have these things
we want to do in life,
and I thought about all the people
I wanted to reach out to that I didn't,
all the fences I wanted to mend,
all the experiences I wanted
to have and I never did.
As I thought about that later on,
I came up with a saying,
which is, "I collect bad wines."
Because if the wine is ready
and the person is there, I'm opening it.
I no longer want to postpone
anything in life.
And that urgency, that purpose,
has really changed my life.
The second thing I learned that day --
and this is as we clear
the George Washington Bridge,
which was by not a lot --
(Laughter)
I thought about, wow,
I really feel one real regret.
I've lived a good life.
In my own humanity and mistakes,
I've tried to get better
at everything I tried.
But in my humanity,
I also allow my ego to get in.
And I regretted the time I wasted
on things that did not matter
with people that matter.
And I thought about
my relationship with my wife,
with my friends, with people.
And after, as I reflected on that,
I decided to eliminate
negative energy from my life.
It's not perfect, but it's a lot better.
I've not had a fight
with my wife in two years.
It feels great.
I no longer try to be right;
I choose to be happy.
The third thing I learned --
and this is as your mental clock
starts going, "15, 14, 13."
You can see the water coming.
I'm saying, "Please blow up."
I don't want this thing
to break in 20 pieces
like you've seen in those documentaries.
And as we're coming down,
I had a sense of, wow, dying is not scary.
It's almost like we've been preparing
for it our whole lives.
But it was very sad.
I didn't want to go; I love my life.
And that sadness
really framed in one thought,
which is, I only wish for one thing.
I only wish I could see my kids grow up.
About a month later,
I was at a performance by my daughter --
first-grader, not much artistic talent --
(Laughter)
Yet!
(Laughter)
And I'm bawling,
I'm crying, like a little kid.
And it made all the sense
in the world to me.
I realized at that point,
by connecting those two dots,
that the only thing
that matters in my life
is being a great dad.
Above all, above all,
the only goal I have in life
is to be a good dad.
I was given the gift of a miracle,
of not dying that day.
I was given another gift,
which was to be able
to see into the future
and come back
and live differently.
I challenge you guys
that are flying today,
imagine the same thing
happens on your plane --
and please don't --
but imagine, and how would you change?
What would you get done
that you're waiting to get done
because you think you'll be here forever?
How would you change your relationships
and the negative energy in them?
And more than anything,
are you being the best parent you can?
Thank you.
(Applause)
I didn't always love unintended consequences,
but I've really learned to appreciate them.
I've learned that they're really the essence
of what makes for progress,
even when they seem to be terrible.
And I'd like to review
just how unintended consequences
play the part that they do.
Let's go to 40,000 years before the present,
to the time of the cultural explosion,
when music, art, technology,
so many of the things that we're enjoying today,
so many of the things that are being demonstrated at TED
were born.
And the anthropologist Randall White
has made a very interesting observation:
that if our ancestors
40,000 years ago
had been able to see
what they had done,
they wouldn't have really understood it.
They were responding
to immediate concerns.
They were making it possible for us
to do what they do,
and yet, they didn't really understand
how they did it.
Now let's advance to 10,000 years before the present.
And this is when it really gets interesting.
What about the domestication of grains?
What about the origins of agriculture?
What would our ancestors 10,000 years ago
have said
if they really had technology assessment?
And I could just imagine the committees
reporting back to them
on where agriculture was going to take humanity,
at least in the next few hundred years.
It was really bad news.
First of all, worse nutrition,
maybe shorter life spans.
It was simply awful for women.
The skeletal remains from that period
have shown that they were grinding grain morning, noon and night.
And politically, it was awful.
It was the beginning of a much higher degree
of inequality among people.
If there had been rational technology assessment then,
I think they very well might have said,
"Let's call the whole thing off."
Even now, our choices are having unintended effects.
Historically, for example,
chopsticks -- according to one Japanese anthropologist
who wrote a dissertation about it
at the University of Michigan --
resulted in long-term changes
in the dentition, in the teeth,
of the Japanese public.
And we are also changing our teeth right now.
There is evidence
that the human mouth and teeth
are growing smaller all the time.
That's not necessarily a bad unintended consequence.
But I think from the point of view of a Neanderthal,
there would have been a lot of disapproval
of the wimpish choppers that we now have.
So these things are kind of relative
to where you or your ancestors happen to stand.
In the ancient world
there was a lot of respect for unintended consequences,
and there was a very healthy sense of caution,
reflected in the Tree of Knowledge,
in Pandora's Box,
and especially in the myth of Prometheus
that's been so important
in recent metaphors about technology.
And that's all very true.
The physicians of the ancient world --
especially the Egyptians,
who started medicine as we know it --
were very conscious
of what they could and couldn't treat.
And the translations of the surviving texts say,
"This I will not treat. This I cannot treat."
They were very conscious.
So were the followers of Hippocrates.
The Hippocratic manuscripts also --
repeatedly, according to recent studies --
show how important it is not to do harm.
More recently,
Harvey Cushing,
who really developed neurosurgery as we know it,
who changed it from a field of medicine
that had a majority of deaths resulting from surgery
to one in which there was a hopeful outlook,
he was very conscious
that he was not always going to do the right thing.
But he did his best,
and he kept meticulous records
that let him transform that branch of medicine.
Now if we look forward a bit
to the 19th century,
we find a new style of technology.
What we find is,
no longer simple tools,
but systems.
We find more and more
complex arrangements of machines
that make it harder and harder
to diagnose what's going on.
And the first people who saw that
were the telegraphers of the mid-19th century,
who were the original hackers.
Thomas Edison would have been very, very comfortable
in the atmosphere of a software firm today.
And these hackers had a word
for those mysterious bugs in telegraph systems
that they called bugs.
That was the origin of the word "bug."
This consciousness, though,
was a little slow to seep through the general population,
even people who were very, very well informed.
Samuel Clemens, Mark Twain,
was a big investor
in the most complex machine of all times --
at least until 1918 --
registered with the U.S. Patent Office.
That was the Paige typesetter.
The Paige typesetter
had 18,000 parts.
The patent had 64 pages of text
and 271 figures.
It was such a beautiful machine
because it did everything that a human being did
in setting type --
including returning the type to its place,
which was a very difficult thing.
And Mark Twain, who knew all about typesetting,
really was smitten by this machine.
Unfortunately, he was smitten in more ways than one,
because it made him bankrupt,
and he had to tour the world speaking
to recoup his money.
And this was an important thing
about 19th century technology,
that all these relationships among parts
could make the most brilliant idea fall apart,
even when judged by the most expert people.
Now there is something else, though, in the early 20th century
that made things even more complicated.
And that was that safety technology itself
could be a source of danger.
The lesson of the Titanic, for a lot of the contemporaries,
was that you must have enough lifeboats
for everyone on the ship.
And this was the result
of the tragic loss of lives
of people who could not get into them.
However, there was another case, the Eastland,
a ship that capsized in Chicago Harbor in 1915,
and it killed 841 people --
that was 14 more
than the passenger toll of the Titanic.
The reason for it, in part, was
the extra life boats that were added
that made this already unstable ship
even more unstable.
And that again proves
that when you're talking about unintended consequences,
it's not that easy to know
the right lessons to draw.
It's really a question of the system, how the ship was loaded,
the ballast and many other things.
So the 20th century, then,
saw how much more complex reality was,
but it also saw a positive side.
It saw that invention
could actually benefit from emergencies.
It could benefit
from tragedies.
And my favorite example of that --
which is not really widely known
as a technological miracle,
but it may be one of the greatest of all times,
was the scaling up of penicillin in the Second World War.
Penicillin was discovered in 1928,
but even by 1940,
no commercially and medically useful quantities of it
were being produced.
A number of pharmaceutical companies were working on it.
They were working on it independently,
and they weren't getting anywhere.
And the Government Research Bureau
brought representatives together
and told them that this is something
that has to be done.
And not only did they do it,
but within two years,
they scaled up penicillin
from preparation in one-liter flasks
to 10,000-gallon vats.
That was how quickly penicillin was produced
and became one of the greatest medical advances of all time.
In the Second World War, too,
the existence
of solar radiation
was demonstrated by studies of interference
that was detected by the radar stations of Great Britain.
So there were benefits in calamities --
benefits to pure science,
as well as to applied science
and medicine.
Now when we come to the period after the Second World War,
unintended consequences get even more interesting.
And my favorite example of that
occurred beginning in 1976,
when it was discovered
that the bacteria causing Legionnaires disease
had always been present in natural waters,
but it was the precise temperature of the water
in heating, ventilating and air conditioning systems
that raised the right temperature
for the maximum reproduction
of Legionella bacillus.
Well, technology to the rescue.
So chemists got to work,
and they developed a bactericide
that became widely used in those systems.
But something else happened in the early 1980s,
and that was that there was a mysterious epidemic
of failures of tape drives
all over the United States.
And IBM, which made them,
just didn't know what to do.
They commissioned a group of their best scientists
to investigate,
and what they found was
that all these tape drives
were located near ventilation ducts.
What happened was the bactericide was formulated
with minute traces of tin.
And these tin particles were deposited on the tape heads
and were crashing the tape heads.
So they reformulated the bactericide.
But what's interesting to me
is that this was the first case
of a mechanical device
suffering, at least indirectly, from a human disease.
So it shows that we're really all in this together.
(Laughter)
In fact, it also shows something interesting,
that although our capabilities and technology
have been expanding geometrically,
unfortunately, our ability to model their long-term behavior,
which has also been increasing,
has been increasing only arithmetically.
So one of the characteristic problems of our time
is how to close this gap
between capabilities and foresight.
One other very positive consequence
of 20th century technology, though,
was the way in which other kinds of calamities
could lead to positive advances.
There are two historians of business
at the University of Maryland,
Brent Goldfarb and David Kirsch,
who have done some extremely interesting work,
much of it still unpublished,
on the history of major innovations.
They have combined the list of major innovations,
and they've discovered that the greatest number, the greatest decade,
for fundamental innovations,
as reflected in all of the lists that others have made --
a number of lists that they have merged --
was the Great Depression.
And nobody knows just why this was so,
but one story can reflect something of it.
It was the origin of the Xerox copier,
which celebrated its 50th anniversary
last year.
And Chester Carlson, the inventor,
was a patent attorney.
He really was not intending
to work in patent research,
but he couldn't really find an alternative technical job.
So this was the best job he could get.
He was upset by the low quality and high cost
of existing patent reproductions,
and so he started to develop
a system of dry photocopying,
which he patented in the late 1930s --
and which became the first dry photocopier
that was commercially practical
in 1960.
So we see that sometimes,
as a result of these dislocations,
as a result of people
leaving their original intended career
and going into something else
where their creativity could make a difference,
that depressions
and all kinds of other unfortunate events
can have a paradoxically stimulating effect
on creativity.
What does this mean?
It means, I think,
that we're living in a time of unexpected possibilities.
Think of the financial world, for example.
The mentor of Warren Buffett, Benjamin Graham,
developed his system of value investing
as a result of his own losses
in the 1929 crash.
And he published that book
in the early 1930s,
and the book still exists in further editions
and is still a fundamental textbook.
So many important creative things can happen
when people learn from disasters.
Now think of the large and small plagues that we have now --
bed bugs, killer bees, spam --
and it's very possible that the solutions to those
will really extend well beyond the immediate question.
If we think, for example, of Louis Pasteur,
who in the 1860s
was asked to study
the diseases of silk worms for the silk industry,
and his discoveries were really the beginning
of the germ theory of disease.
So very often, some kind of disaster --
sometimes the consequence, for example,
of over-cultivation of silk worms,
which was a problem in Europe at the time --
can be the key to something much bigger.
So this means
that we need to take a different view
of unintended consequences.
We need to take a really positive view.
We need to see what they can do for us.
We need to learn
from those figures that I mentioned.
We need to learn, for example, from Dr. Cushing,
who killed patients
in the course of his early operations.
He had to have some errors. He had to have some mistakes.
And he learned meticulously from his mistakes.
And as a result,
when we say, "This isn't brain surgery,"
that pays tribute to how difficult it was
for anyone to learn from their mistakes
in a field of medicine
that was considered so discouraging in its prospects.
And we can also remember
how the pharmaceutical companies
were willing to pool their knowledge,
to share their knowledge,
in the face of an emergency,
which they hadn't really been for years and years.
They might have been able to do it earlier.
The message, then, for me,
about unintended consequences
is chaos happens;
let's make better use of it.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
The language I'm speaking right now
is on its way to becoming
the world's universal language,
for better or for worse.
Let's face it,
it's the language of the internet,
it's the language of finance,
it's the language of air traffic control,
of popular music,
diplomacy --
English is everywhere.
Now, Mandarin Chinese
is spoken by more people,
but more Chinese people
are learning English
than English speakers
are learning Chinese.
Last I heard,
there are two dozen universities
in China right now
teaching all in English.
English is taking over.
And in addition to that,
it's been predicted
that at the end of the century
almost all of the languages
that exist now --
there are about 6,000 --
will no longer be spoken.
There will only be some hundreds left.
And on top of that,
it's at the point where
instant translation of live speech
is not only possible,
but it gets better every year.
The reason I'm reciting
those things to you
is because I can tell
that we're getting to the point
where a question
is going to start being asked,
which is: Why should we
learn foreign languages --
other than if English
happens to be foreign to one?
Why bother to learn another one
when it's getting to the point
where almost everybody in the world
will be able to communicate in one?
I think there are a lot of reasons,
but I first want to address
the one that you're probably
most likely to have heard of,
because actually it's more
dangerous than you might think.
And that is the idea
that a language channels your thoughts,
that the vocabulary
and the grammar of different languages
gives everybody
a different kind of acid trip,
so to speak.
That is a marvelously enticing idea,
but it's kind of fraught.
So it's not that it's untrue completely.
So for example, in French and Spanish
the word for table is,
for some reason, marked as feminine.
So, "la table," "la mesa,"
you just have to deal with it.
It has been shown
that if you are a speaker
of one of those languages
and you happen to be asked
how you would imagine a table talking,
then much more often
than could possibly be an accident,
a French or a Spanish speaker
says that the table would talk
with a high and feminine voice.
So if you're French or Spanish,
to you, a table is kind of a girl,
as opposed to if you
are an English speaker.
It's hard not to love data like that,
and many people
will tell you that that means
that there's a worldview that you have
if you speak one of those languages.
But you have to watch out,
because imagine if somebody
put us under the microscope,
the us being those of us
who speak English natively.
What is the worldview from English?
So for example,
let's take an English speaker.
Up on the screen, that is Bono.
He speaks English.
I presume he has a worldview.
Now, that is Donald Trump.
In his way,
he speaks English as well.
(Laughter)
And here is Ms. Kardashian,
and she is an English speaker, too.
So here are three speakers
of the English language.
What worldview do those
three people have in common?
What worldview is shaped through
the English language that unites them?
It's a highly fraught concept.
And so gradual consensus is becoming
that language can shape thought,
but it tends to be in rather darling,
obscure psychological flutters.
It's not a matter of giving you
a different pair of glasses on the world.
Now, if that's the case,
then why learn languages?
If it isn't going to change
the way you think,
what would the other reasons be?
There are some.
One of them is that if you
want to imbibe a culture,
if you want to drink it in,
if you want to become part of it,
then whether or not
the language channels the culture --
and that seems doubtful --
if you want to imbibe the culture,
you have to control to some degree
the language that the culture
happens to be conducted in.
There's no other way.
There's an interesting
illustration of this.
I have to go slightly obscure,
but really you should seek it out.
There's a movie by the Canadian
film director Denys Arcand --
read out in English on the page,
"Dennis Ar-cand,"
if you want to look him up.
He did a film called "Jesus of Montreal."
And many of the characters
are vibrant, funny, passionate,
interesting French-Canadian,
French-speaking women.
There's one scene closest to the end,
where they have to take a friend
to an Anglophone hospital.
In the hospital,
they have to speak English.
Now, they speak English
but it's not their native language,
they'd rather not speak English.
And they speak it more slowly,
they have accents, they're not idiomatic.
Suddenly these characters
that you've fallen in love with
become husks of themselves,
they're shadows of themselves.
To go into a culture
and to only ever process people
through that kind of skrim curtain
is to never truly get the culture.
And so to the extent that hundreds
of languages will be left,
one reason to learn them
is because they are tickets
to being able to participate
in the culture of the people
who speak them,
just by virtue of the fact
that it is their code.
So that's one reason.
Second reason:
it's been shown
that if you speak two languages,
dementia is less likely to set in,
and that you are probably
a better multitasker.
And these are factors that set in early,
and so that ought to give you some sense
of when to give junior or juniorette
lessons in another language.
Bilingualism is healthy.
And then, third --
languages are just an awful lot of fun.
Much more fun than we're often told.
So for example,
Arabic: "kataba," he wrote,
"yaktubu," he writes, she writes.
"Uktub," write, in the imperative.
What do those things have in common?
All those things have in common
the consonants sitting
in the middle like pillars.
They stay still,
and the vowels
dance around the consonants.
Who wouldn't want to roll
that around in their mouths?
You can get that from Hebrew,
you can get that from Ethiopia's
main language, Amharic.
That's fun.
Or languages have different word orders.
Learning how to speak
with different word order
is like driving on the different side
of a street if you go to certain country,
or the feeling that you get when you
put Witch Hazel around your eyes
and you feel the tingle.
A language can do that to you.
So for example,
"The Cat in the Hat Comes Back,"
a book that I'm sure
we all often return to,
like "Moby Dick."
One phrase in it is,
"Do you know where I found him?
Do you know where he was?
He was eating cake in the tub,
Yes he was!"
Fine. Now, if you learn that
in Mandarin Chinese,
then you have to master,
"You can know, I did where him find?
He was tub inside gorging cake,
No mistake gorging chewing!"
That just feels good.
Imagine being able to do that
for years and years at a time.
Or, have you ever learned any Cambodian?
Me either, but if I did,
I would get to roll around in my mouth
not some baker's dozen of vowels
like English has,
but a good 30 different vowels
scooching and oozing around
in the Cambodian mouth
like bees in a hive.
That is what a language can get you.
And more to the point,
we live in an era when it's never been
easier to teach yourself another language.
It used to be that you had
to go to a classroom,
and there would be
some diligent teacher --
some genius teacher in there --
but that person was only
in there at certain times
and you had to go then,
and then was not most times.
You had to go to class.
If you didn't have that,
you had something called a record.
I cut my teeth on those.
There was only so much data on a record,
or a cassette,
or even that antique object known as a CD.
Other than that you had books
that didn't work,
that's just the way it was.
Today you can lay down --
lie on your living room floor,
sipping bourbon,
and teach yourself
any language that you want to
with wonderful sets
such as Rosetta Stone.
I highly recommend
the lesser known Glossika as well.
You can do it any time,
therefore you can do it more and better.
You can give yourself your morning
pleasures in various languages.
I take some "Dilbert" in various
languages every single morning;
it can increase your skills.
Couldn't have done it 20 years ago
when the idea of having
any language you wanted
in your pocket,
coming from your phone,
would have sounded like science fiction
to very sophisticated people.
So I highly recommend
that you teach yourself languages
other than the one that I'm speaking,
because there's never been
a better time to do it.
It's an awful lot of fun.
It won't change your mind,
but it will most certainly blow your mind.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
When was I was 21 years old,
I had all this physics homework.
Physics homework requires taking breaks,
and Wikipedia was relatively new,
so I took a lot of breaks there.
I kept going back to the same articles,
reading them again and again,
on glaciers, Antarctica and Greenland.
How cool would it be to visit these places
and what would it take to do so?
Well, here we are
on a repurposed Air Force cargo plane
operated by NASA
flying over the Greenland ice sheet.
There's a lot to see here,
but there's more that is hidden,
waiting to be uncovered.
What the Wikipedia articles didn't tell me
is that there's liquid water
hidden inside the ice sheet,
because we didn't know that yet.
I did learn on Wikipedia
that the Greenland ice sheet is huge,
the size of Mexico,
and its ice from top to bottom
is two miles thick.
But it's not just static.
The ice flows like a river
downhill towards the ocean.
As it flows around bends,
it deforms and cracks.
I get to study these amazing ice dynamics,
which are located in one of the most
remote physical environments
remaining on earth.
To work in glaciology right now
is like getting in on the ground floor
at Facebook in the 2000s.
(Laughter)
Our capability to fly airplanes
and satellites over the ice sheets
is revolutionizing glaciology.
It's just starting to do for science
what the smartphone
has done for social media.
The satellites are reporting
a wealth of observations
that are revealing new hidden facts
about the ice sheets continuously.
For instance, we have observations
of the size of the Greenland ice sheet
every month going back to 2002.
You can look towards the bottom
of the screen here
to see the month and the year go forward.
You can see that some areas
of the ice sheet melt
or lose ice in the summer.
Other areas experience snowfall
or gain ice back in the winter.
This seasonal cycle, though, is eclipsed
by an overall rate of mass loss
that would have stunned
a glaciologist 50 years ago.
We never thought that an ice sheet could
lose mass into the ocean this quickly.
Since these measurements began in 2002,
the ice sheet has lost so much ice
that if that water were piled up
on our smallest continent,
it would drown Australia knee-deep.
How is this possible?
Well, under the ice lies the bedrock.
We used radar to image the hills,
valleys, mountains and depressions
that the ice flows over.
Hidden under the ice sheet are channels
the size of the Grand Canyon
that funnel ice and water
off of Greenland and into the ocean.
The reason that radar
can reveal the bedrock
is that ice is entirely
transparent to radar.
You can do an experiment.
Go home and put
an ice cube in the microwave.
It won't melt,
because microwaves, or radar,
pass straight through the ice
without interacting.
If you want to melt your ice cube,
you have to get it wet,
because water heats up easily
in the microwave.
That's the whole principle
the microwave oven is designed around.
Radar can see water.
And radar has revealed
a vast pool of liquid water
hidden under my colleague Olivia,
seven stories beneath her feet.
Here, she's used a pump
to bring some of that water
back to the ice sheet's surface.
Just six years ago, we had no idea
this glacier aquifer existed.
The aquifer formed
when snow melts in the summer sun
and trickles downward.
It puddles up in huge pools.
From there, the snow acts as an igloo,
insulating this water
from the cold and the wind above.
So the water can stay
hidden in the ice sheet
in liquid form year after year.
The question is, what happens next?
Does the water stay there forever?
It could.
Or does it find a way out
to reach the global ocean?
One possible way
for the water to reach the bedrock
and from there the ocean
is a crevasse, or a crack in the ice.
When cracks fill with water,
the weight of the water
forces them deeper and deeper.
This is how fracking works
to extract natural gas
from deep within the earth.
Pressurized fluids fracture rocks.
All it takes is a crack to get started.
Well, we recently discovered
that there are cracks available
in the Greenland ice sheet
near this glacier aquifer.
You can fly over
most of the Greenland ice sheet
and see nothing,
no cracks, no features on the surface,
but as this helicopter
flies towards the coast,
the path that water would take
on its quest to flow downhill,
one crack appears,
then another and another.
Are these cracks filled with liquid water?
And if so, how deep
do they take that water?
Can they take it to the bedrock
and the ocean?
To answer these questions,
we need something
beyond remote sensing data.
We need numeric models.
I write numeric models
that run on supercomputers.
A numeric model
is simply a set of equations
that works together to describe something.
It can be as simple
as the next number in a sequence --
one, three, five, seven --
or it can be a more complex
set of equations
that predict the future
based on known conditions in the present.
In our case, what are
the equations for how ice cracks?
Well, engineers already have
a very good understanding
of how aluminum, steel and plastics
fracture under stress.
It's an important problem in our society.
And it turns out
that the engineering equations
for how materials fracture
are not that different
from my physics homework.
So I borrowed them, adapted them for ice,
and then I had a numeric model
for how a crevasse can fracture
when filled with water from the aquifer.
This is the power of math.
It can help us understand
real processes in our world.
I'll show you now
the results of my numeric model,
but first I should point out
that the crevasse is about
a thousand times narrower than it is deep,
so in the main panel here,
we've zoomed in to better see the details.
You can look to the smaller
panel on the right
to see the true scale
for how tall and skinny the crevasse is.
As the aquifer water
flows into the crevasse,
some of it refreezes
in the negative 15 degree Celsius ice.
That's about as cold
as your kitchen freezer.
But this loss can be overcome
if the flow rate in from
the glacier aquifer is high enough.
In our case, it is,
and the aquifer water drives the crevasse
all the way to the base of the ice sheet
a thousand meters below.
From there, it has a clear path
to reach the ocean.
So the aquifer water is a part
of the three millimeters
per year of sea level rise
that we experience as a global society.
But there's more:
the aquifer water
might be punching above its weight.
The ice flows in complex ways.
In some places, the ice flows very fast.
There tends to be water
at the base of the ice sheet here.
In other places, not so fast.
Usually, there's not water
present at the base there.
Now that we know the aquifer water
is getting to the base of the ice sheet,
the next question is:
Is it making the ice itself
flow faster into the ocean?
We're trying to uncover these mysteries
hidden inside the Greenland ice sheet
so that we can better plan
for the sea level rise it holds.
The amount of ice
that Greenland has lost since 2002
is just a small fraction
of what that ice sheet holds.
Ice sheets are immense, powerful machines
that operate on long timescales.
In the next 80 years, global sea levels
will rise at least 20 centimeters,
perhaps as much as one meter,
and maybe more.
Our understanding
of future sea level rise is good,
but our projections have a wide range.
It's our role as glaciologists
and scientists
to narrow these uncertainties.
How much sea level rise is coming,
and how fast will it get here?
We need to know how much and how fast,
so the world and its communities can
plan for the sea level rise that's coming.
Thank you.
(Applause)
We're at a critical moment.
Our leaders,
some of our great institutions
are failing us.
Why?
In some cases, it's because they're bad
or unethical,
but often, they've taken us
to the wrong objectives.
And this is unacceptable.
This has to stop.
How are we going to correct these wrongs?
How are we going
to choose the right course?
It's not going to be easy.
For years, I've worked with talented teams
and they've chosen the right objectives
and the wrong objectives.
Many have succeeded,
others of them have failed.
And today I'm going to share with you
what really makes a difference --
that's what's crucial,
how and why
they set meaningful and audacious goals,
the right goals for the right reasons.
Let's go back to 1975.
Yep, this is me.
I've got a lot to learn,
I'm a computer engineer,
I've got long hair,
but I'm working under Andy Grove,
who's been called the greatest manager
of his or any other era.
Andy was a superb leader
and also a teacher,
and he said to me, "John,
it almost doesn't matter what you know.
Execution is what matters the most."
And so Andy invented a system
called "Objectives and Key Results."
It kind of rolls off
the tongue, doesn't it?
And it's all about excellent execution.
So here's a classic video from the 1970s
of professor Andy Grove.
(Video) Andy Grove: The two key phrases
of the management by objective systems
are the objectives and the key results,
and they match the two purposes.
The objective is the direction.
The key results have to be measured,
but at the end you can look
and without any argument say,
"Did I do that, or did I not do that?"
Yes. No. Simple.
John Doerr: That's Andy.
Yes. No. Simple.
Objectives and Key Results,
or OKRs,
are a simple goal-setting system
and they work for organizations,
they work for teams,
they even work for individuals.
The objectives are what
you want to have accomplished.
The key results are how
I'm going to get that done.
Objectives. Key results.
What and how.
But here's the truth:
many of us are setting goals wrong,
and most of us
are not setting goals at all.
A lot of organizations
set objectives and meet them.
They ship their sales,
they introduce their new products,
they make their numbers,
but they lack a sense of purpose
to inspire their teams.
So how do you set
these goals the right way?
First, you must answer
the question, "Why?"
Why?
Because truly transformational teams
combine their ambitions
to their passion and to their purpose,
and they develop a clear
and compelling sense of why.
I want to tell you a story.
I work with a remarkable entrepreneur.
Her name is Jini Kim.
She runs a company called Nuna.
Nuna is a health care data company.
And when Nuna was founded,
they used data to serve the health needs
of lots of workers at large companies.
And then two years
into the company's life,
the federal government issued a proposal
to build the first ever
cloud database for Medicaid.
Now, you'll remember
that Medicaid is that program
that serves 70 million Americans,
our poor, our children
and people with disabilities.
Nuna at the time was just 15 people
and this database
had to be built in one year,
and they had a whole set of commitments
that they had to honor,
and frankly, they weren't going to make
very much money on the project.
This was a bet-your-company moment,
and Jini seized it.
She jumped at the opportunity.
She did not flinch.
Why?
Well, it's a personal why.
Jini's younger brother Kimong has autism.
And when he was seven,
he had his first grand mal seizure
at Disneyland.
He fell to the ground.
He stopped breathing.
Jini's parents are Korean immigrants.
They came to the country
with limited resources
speaking little English,
so it was up to Jini
to enroll her family in Medicaid.
She was nine years old.
That moment defined her mission,
and that mission became her company,
and that company bid on, won
and delivered on that contract.
Here's Jini to tell you why.
(Video) Jini Kim: Medicaid
saved my family from bankruptcy,
and today it provides for Kimong's health
and for millions of others.
Nuna is my love letter to Medicaid.
Every row of data is a life
whose story deserves
to be told with dignity.
JD: And Jini's story tells us
that a compelling sense of why
can be the launchpad for our objectives.
Remember, that's what
we want to have accomplished.
And objectives are significant,
they're action-oriented,
they are inspiring,
and they're a kind of vaccine
against fuzzy thinking.
You think a rockstar
would be an unlikely user
of Objectives and Key Results,
but for years, Bono has used OKRs
to wage a global war
against poverty and disease,
and his ONE organization
has focused on two really gorgeous,
audacious objectives.
The first is debt relief
for the poorest countries in the world.
The next is universal access
to anti-HIV drugs.
Now, why are these good objectives?
Let's go back to our checklist.
Significant? Check. Concrete? Yes.
Action-oriented? Yes.
Inspirational?
Well, let's just listen to Bono.
(Video) Bono: So you're passionate?
How passionate?
What actions does your passion
lead you to do?
If the heart doesn't find
a perfect rhyme with the head,
then your passion means nothing.
The OKR framework cultivates the madness,
the chemistry contained inside it.
It gives us an environment for risk,
for trust,
where failing is not a fireable offense.
And when you have that sort
of structure and environment
and the right people,
magic is around the corner.
JD: I love that.
OKRs cultivate the madness,
and magic is right around the corner.
This is perfect.
So with Jini we've covered the whys,
with Bono the whats of goal-setting.
Let's turn our attention to the hows.
Remember, the hows are the key results.
That's how we meet our objectives.
And good results
are specific and time-bound.
They're aggressive but realistic.
They're measurable,
and they're verifiable.
Those are good key results.
In 1999, I introduced OKRs
to Google's cofounders,
Larry and Sergey.
Here they are,
24 years old in their garage.
And Sergey enthusiastically
said he'd adopt them.
Well, not quite.
What he really said was,
"We don't have any other way
to manage this company,
so we'll give it a go."
(Laughter)
And I took that as a kind of endorsement.
But every quarter since then,
every Googler has written down
her objectives and her key results.
They've graded them,
and they've published them
for everyone to see.
And these are not used
for bonuses or for promotions.
They're set aside.
They're used for a higher purpose,
and that's to get collective commitment
to truly stretch goals.
In 2008, a Googler, Sundar Pichai,
took on an objective
which was to build
the next generation client platform
for the future of web applications --
in other words, build the best browser.
He was very thoughtful
about how he chose his key results.
How do you measure the best browser?
It could be ad clicks or engagement.
No. He said: numbers of users,
because users are going to decide
if Chrome is a great browser or not.
So he had this one
three-year-long objective:
build the best browser.
And then every year
he stuck to the same key results,
numbers of users, but he upped the ante.
In the first year,
his goal was 20 million users
and he missed it.
He got less than 10.
Second year, he raised
the bar to 50 million.
He got to 37 million users.
Somewhat better.
In the third year,
he upped the ante once more
to a hundred million.
He launched an aggressive
marketing campaign,
broader distribution,
improved the technology, and kaboom!
He got 111 million users.
Here's why I like this story,
not so much for the happy ending,
but it shows someone
carefully choosing the right objective
and then sticking to it
year after year after year.
It's a perfect story for a nerd like me.
Now, I think of OKRs
as transparent vessels
that are made from the whats
and hows of our ambitions.
What really matters is the why
that we pour into those vessels.
That's why we do our work.
OKRs are not a silver bullet.
They're not going to be
a substitute for a strong culture
or for stronger leadership,
but when those fundamentals are in place,
they can take you to the mountaintop.
I want you to think
about your life for a moment.
Do you have the right metrics?
Take time to write down your values,
your objectives and your key results.
Do it today.
If you'd like some feedback on them,
you can send them to me.
I'm john@whatmatters.com.
If we think of the world-changing goals
of an Intel, of a Nuna, of Bono,
of Google,
they're remarkable:
ubiquitous computing,
affordable health care,
high-quality for everyone,
ending global poverty,
access to all the world's information.
Here's the deal:
every one of those goals
is powered today by OKRs.
Now, I've been called
the Johnny Appleseed of OKRs
for spreading the good gospel
according to Andy Grove,
but I want you
to join me in this movement.
Let's fight for what it is
that really matters,
because we can take OKRs
beyond our businesses.
We can take them to our families,
to our schools,
even to our governments.
We can hold those governments accountable.
We can transform those informations.
We can get back on the right track
if we can and do measure
what really matters.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Azim Khamisa: We humans
have many defining moments in our lives.
Sometimes these moments are joyous,
and sometimes they are heartbreaking,
tragic.
But at these defining moments,
if we are able to make the right choice,
we literally manifest a miracle
in us and others.
My only son Tariq, a university student,
kind, generous, a good writer,
a good photographer,
had aspirations
to work for National Geographic,
engaged to a beautiful lady,
worked as a pizza deliveryman
on Fridays and Saturdays.
He was lured to a bogus address
by a youth gang.
And in a gang initiation,
a 14-year-old shot and killed him.
The sudden, senseless death
of an innocent, unarmed human being;
the overwhelming grief of a family;
the total confusion as you try
to absorb a new, hideous reality.
Needless to say it brought
my life to a crashing halt.
One of the hardest things
I've ever had to do
was to call his mother,
who lived in a different city.
How do you tell a mother
she's never going to see her son again,
or hear him laugh,
or give him a hug?
I practice as a Sufi Muslim.
I meditate two hours a day.
And sometimes,
in deep trauma and deep tragedy,
there is a spark of clarity.
So what I downloaded in my meditation
is that there were victims
at both ends of the gun.
It's easy to see that my son
was a victim of the 14-year-old,
a little bit complicated to see
that he was a victim of American society.
And that begs the question,
well, who is American society?
Well, it's you and me,
because I don't believe
that society is just happenstance.
I think we are all responsible
for the society we've created.
And children killing children
is not a mark of a civil society.
So nine months after Tariq died,
I started the Tariq Khamisa Foundation
and our mandate
at the Tariq Khamisa Foundation
is to stop kids from killing kids
by breaking the cycle of youth violence.
And essentially we have three mandates.
Our first and foremost
is to save lives of children.
It's important to do.
We lose so many on a daily basis.
Our second mandate
is to empower the right choices
so kids don't fall through the cracks
and choose lives of gangs and crime
and drugs and alcohol and weapons.
And our third mandate is to teach
the principles of nonviolence,
of empathy, of compassion,
of forgiveness.
And I started with a very simple premise
that violence is a learned behavior.
No child was born violent.
If you accept that as a truism,
nonviolence can also be
a learned behavior,
but you have to teach it,
because kids are not going to learn that
through osmosis.
Soon after that,
I reached out to my brother here,
with the attitude
that we had both lost a son.
My son died.
He lost his grandson
to the adult prison system.
And I asked him to join me.
As you see, 22 years later,
we are still here together,
because I can't bring Tariq
back from the dead,
you can't take Tony out of prison,
but the one thing we can do
is make sure no other young people
in our community
end up dead or end up in prison.
With the grace of God,
the Tariq Khamisa Foundation
has been successful.
We have a safe school model
which has four different programs.
The first one is a live assembly
with Ples and me.
We are introduced,
this man's grandson killed this man's son,
and here they are together.
We have in-classroom curriculum.
We have an after school mentoring program,
and we create a peace club.
And I'm happy to share with you
that besides teaching
these principles of nonviolence,
we are able to cut suspensions
and expulsions by 70 percent,
which is huge.
(Applause)
Which is huge.
Five years after Tariq died,
and for me to complete
my journey of forgiveness,
I went to see the young man
who killed my son.
He was 19 years old.
And I remember that meeting
because we were --
he's 37, still in prison --
but at that first meeting,
we locked eyeballs.
I'm looking in his eyes,
he's looking in my eyes,
and I'm looking in his eyes
trying to find a murderer, and I didn't.
I was able to climb through his eyes
and touch his humanity that I got
that the spark in him
was no different than the spark in me
or anybody else here.
So I wasn't expecting that.
He was remorseful.
He was articulate. He was well-mannered.
And I could tell that my hand
of forgiveness had changed him.
So with that, please welcome
my brother, Ples.
(Applause)
Ples Felix: Tony is my one
and only daughter's one and only child.
Tony was born to my daughter,
who was 15 when she gave birth to Tony.
Mothering is the toughest
job on the planet.
There is no tougher job on the planet
than raising another human being
and making sure they're safe, secure
and well-positioned
to be successful in life.
Tony experienced a lot of violence
in his life as a young kid.
He saw one of his favorite cousins
be murdered in a hail
of automatic weapon fire
and gang involvement in Los Angeles.
He was very traumatized
in so many different ways.
Tony came to live with me.
I wanted to make sure
he had everything a kid needed
to be successful.
But on this particular evening,
after years of being with me
and struggling mightily
to try to be successful
and to live up to my expectations
of being a successful person,
on this one particular day,
Tony ran away from home that evening,
he went to be with people
he thought were his friends,
he was given drugs and alcohol
and he took them
because he thought
they would make him feel carefree.
But all it did was
to make his anxiety go higher
and to create a more ...
more deadly thinking on his part.
He was invited to a robbery,
he was given a 9mm handgun.
And at the presence
of an 18-year-old who commanded him
and two 14-year-old boys
he thought were his friends,
he shot and killed Tariq Khamisa,
this man's son.
There are no words, there are no words
that can express the loss of a child.
At my understanding
that my grandson was responsible
for the murder of this human being,
I went to the prayer closet,
like I was taught by my old folks,
and began to pray and meditate.
The one thing that Mr. Khamisa
and I have in common,
and we didn't know this,
besides being wonderful human beings,
is that we both meditate.
(Laughter)
It was very helpful for me
because it offered me an opportunity
to seek guidance and clarity
about how I wanted to be of support
of this man and his family in this loss.
And sure enough, my prayers were answered,
because I was invited
to a meeting at this man's house,
met his mother, his father,
his wife, his brother, met their family
and had a chance to be in the presence
of God-spirited people led by this man,
who in the spirit of forgiveness,
made way, made an opportunity for me
to be of value and to share with him
and to share with children
the importance of understanding the need
to be with a responsible adult,
focus on your anger
in a way that's healthy,
learn to meditate.
The programs that we have
in the Tariq Khamisa Foundation
provide so many tools
for the kids to put in their toolkit
so they could carry them
throughout their lives.
It's important that our children
understand that loving, caring adults
care for them and support them,
but it's also important
that our children learn to meditate,
learn to be peaceful,
learn to be centered
and learn to interact
with the other children
in a kind, empathetic
and wonderfully loving way.
We need more love in our society
and that's why we are here
to share the love with children,
because our children
will lead the way for us,
because all of us
will depend on our children.
As we grow older and retire,
they will take over this world for us,
so as much love as we teach them,
they will give it back to us.
Blessings. Thank you.
(Applause)
AK: So I was born in Kenya,
I was educated in England,
and my brother here is a Baptist.
I practice as a Sufi Muslim.
He's African American,
but I always tell him,
I'm the African American in the group.
I was born in Africa. You were not.
(Laughter)
And I naturalized as a citizen.
I'm a first-generation citizen.
And I felt that, as an American citizen,
I must take my share of the responsibility
for the murder of my son.
Why? Because it was fired
by an American child.
You could take the position,
he killed my one and only son,
he should be hung from the highest pole.
How does that improve society?
And I know you are probably wondering
what happened to that young man.
He's still in prison.
He just turned 37 on September 22,
but I have some good news.
We've been trying
to get him out for 12 years.
He finally will join us a year from now.
(Applause)
And I'm very excited to have him join us,
because I know we've saved him,
but he will save
tens of thousands of students
when he shares his testimony
in schools that we are present at
on a regular basis.
When he says to the kids,
"When I was 11, I joined a gang.
When I was 14,
I murdered Mr. Khamisa's son.
I've spent the last
umpteen years in prison.
I'm here to tell you: it's not worth it,"
do you think the kids
will listen to that voice?
Yes, because his intonations
will be of a person
that pulled the trigger.
And I know that he wants
to turn the clock back.
Of course, that's not possible.
I wish it was. I would have my son back.
My brother would have his grandson back.
So I think that demonstrates
the power of forgiveness.
So what's the big takeaway here?
So I want to end
our session with this quote,
which is the basis of my fourth book,
which incidentally,
the foreword for that book
was written by Tony.
So it goes like this:
sustained goodwill creates friendship.
You don't make friends
by bombing them, right?
You make friends by extending goodwill.
That ought to be obvious.
So sustained goodwill creates friendship,
sustained friendship creates trust,
sustained trust creates empathy,
sustained empathy creates compassion,
and sustained compassion creates peace.
I call this my peace formula.
It starts with goodwill, friendship,
trust, empathy, compassion and peace.
But people ask me,
how do you extend goodwill
to the person who murdered your child?
I tell them, you do that
through forgiveness.
As it's evident it worked for me.
It worked for my family.
What's a miracle is it worked for Tony,
it worked for his family,
it can work for you and your family,
for Israel and Palestine,
North and South Korea,
for Iraq, Afghanistan, Iran and Syria.
It can work for
the United States of America.
So let me leave you with this, my sisters,
and a couple of brothers --
(Laughter)
that peace is possible.
How do I know that?
Because I am at peace.
Thank you very much. Namaste.
(Applause)
You may not realize this,
but there are more bacteria in your body
than stars in our entire galaxy.
This fascinating universe
of bacteria inside of us
is an integral part of our health,
and our technology is evolving so rapidly
that today we can program these bacteria
like we program computers.
Now, the diagram that you see here,
I know it looks like
some kind of sports play,
but it is actually a blueprint of
the first bacterial program I developed.
And like writing software,
we can print and write DNA
into different algorithms
and programs inside of bacteria.
What this program does
is produces fluorescent proteins
in a rhythmic fashion
and generates a small molecule
that allows bacteria
to communicate and synchronize,
as you're seeing in this movie.
The growing colony of bacteria
that you see here
is about the width of a human hair.
Now, what you can't see
is that our genetic program
instructs these bacteria
to each produce small molecules,
and these molecules travel between
the thousands of individual bacteria
telling them when to turn on and off.
And the bacteria synchronize
quite well at this scale,
but because the molecule that synchronizes
them together can only travel so fast,
in larger colonies of bacteria,
this results in traveling waves
between bacteria that are
far away from each other,
and you can see these waves going
from right to left across the screen.
Now, our genetic program
relies on a natural phenomenon
called quorum sensing,
in which bacteria trigger coordinated
and sometimes virulent behaviors
once they reach a critical density.
You can observe quorum sensing
in action in this movie,
where a growing colony of bacteria
only begins to glow
once it reaches a high
or critical density.
Our genetic program
continues producing these
rhythmic patterns of fluorescent proteins
as the colony grows outwards.
This particular movie and experiment
we call The Supernova,
because it looks like an exploding star.
Now, besides programming
these beautiful patterns,
I wondered, what else can we get
these bacteria to do?
And I decided to explore
how we can program bacteria
to detect and treat diseases
in our bodies like cancer.
One of the surprising facts about bacteria
is that they can naturally grow
inside of tumors.
This happens because typically tumors
are areas where the immune system
has no access,
and so bacteria find these tumors
and use them as a safe haven
to grow and thrive.
We started using probiotic bacteria
which are safe bacteria
that have a health benefit,
and found that
when orally delivered to mice,
these probiotics would selectively
grow inside of liver tumors.
We realized that the most convenient way
to highlight the presence
of the probiotics,
and hence, the presence of the tumors,
was to get these bacteria
to produce a signal
that would be detectable in the urine,
and so we specifically
programmed these probiotics
to make a molecule that would change
the color of your urine
to indicate the presence of cancer.
We went on to show that this technology
could sensitively and specifically
detect liver cancer,
one that is challenging
to detect otherwise.
Now, since these bacteria
specifically localize to tumors,
we've been programming them
to not only detect cancer
but also to treat cancer
by producing therapeutic molecules
from within the tumor environment
that shrink the existing tumors,
and we've been doing this
using quorum sensing programs
like you saw in the previous movies.
Altogether, imagine in the future
taking a programmed probiotic
that could detect and treat cancer,
or even other diseases.
Our ability to program bacteria
and program life
opens up new horizons in cancer research,
and to share this vision,
I worked with artist Vik Muniz
to create the symbol of the universe,
made entirely out of bacteria
or cancer cells.
Ultimately, my hope is that the beauty
and purpose of this microscopic universe
can inspire new and creative approaches
for the future of cancer research.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Like many of you here, I am trying to contribute
towards a renaissance in Africa.
The question of transformation in Africa
really is a question of leadership.
Africa can only be transformed by enlightened leaders.
And it is my contention that the manner in which
we educate our leaders is fundamental
to progress on this continent.
I want to tell you some stories that explain my view.
We all heard about the importance of stories yesterday.
An American friend of mine this year volunteered as a nurse in Ghana,
and in a period of three months she came to a conclusion
about the state of leadership in Africa
that had taken me over a decade to reach.
Twice she was involved in surgeries
where they lost power at the hospital.
The emergency generators did not start.
There was not a flashlight, not a lantern, not a candle --
pitch black.
The patient's cut open, twice.
The first time it was a C-section.
Thankfully, baby was out -- mother and child survived.
The second time was a procedure that involved local anesthesia.
Anesthetic wears off. The patient feels pain.
He's crying. He's screaming. He's praying.
Pitch black. Not a candle, not a flashlight.
And that hospital could have afforded flashlights.
They could have afforded to purchase these things, but they didn't.
And it happened twice.
Another time, she watched in horror as nurses watched a patient die
because they refused to give her oxygen that they had.
And so three months later,
just before she returned to the United States,
nurses in Accra go on strike.
And her recommendation is
take this opportunity to fire everyone, start all over again.
Start all over again.
Now what does this have to do with leadership?
You see, the folks at the ministry of health,
the hospital administrators, the doctors, the nurses --
they are among just five percent of their peers
who get an education after secondary school.
They are the elite. They are our leaders.
Their decisions, their actions matter.
And when they fail, a nation literally suffers.
So when I speak of leadership,
I'm not talking about just political leaders.
We've heard a lot about that.
I'm talking about the elite.
Those who've been trained,
whose job it is to be the guardians of their society.
The lawyers, the judges, the policemen, the doctors,
the engineers, the civil servants --
those are the leaders.
And we need to train them right.
Now, my first pointed and memorable experience with leadership in Ghana
occurred when I was 16 years old.
We had just had a military coup,
and soldiers were pervasive in our society.
They were a pervasive presence.
And one day I go to the airport to meet my father,
and as I walk up this grassy slope from the car park
to the terminal building,
I'm stopped by two soldiers wielding AK-47 assault weapons.
And they asked me to join a crowd of people
that were running up and down this embankment.
Why? Because the path I had taken was considered out of bounds.
No sign to this effect.
Now, I was 16. I was very worried about
what my peers at school might think
if they saw me running up and down this hill.
I was especially concerned of what the girls might think.
And so I started to argue with these men.
It was a little reckless, but you know, I was 16.
I got lucky.
A Ghana Airways pilot falls into the same predicament.
Because of his uniform they speak to him differently,
and they explain to him that they're just following orders.
So he takes their radio, talks to their boss,
and gets us all released.
What lessons would you take from an experience like this?
Several, for me.
Leadership matters. Those men are following
the orders of a superior officer.
I learned something about courage.
It was important not to look at those guns.
And I also learned that it can be helpful to think about girls.
(Laughter)
So a few years after this event, I leave Ghana on a scholarship
to go to Swarthmore College for my education.
It was a breath of fresh air.
You know, the faculty there didn't want us to memorize information
and repeat back to them as I was used to back in Ghana.
They wanted us to think critically.
They wanted us to be analytical.
They wanted us to be concerned about social issues.
In my economics classes I got high marks
for my understanding of basic economics.
But I learned something more profound than that,
which is that the leaders -- the managers of Ghana's economy --
were making breathtakingly bad decisions
that had brought our economy to the brink of collapse.
And so here was this lesson again -- leadership matters.
It matters a great deal.
But I didn't really fully understand what had happened to me at Swarthmore.
I had an inkling,
but I didn't fully realize it until I went out into the workplace
and I went to work at Microsoft Corporation.
And I was part of this team -- this thinking, learning team
whose job it was to design and implement new software
that created value in the world.
And it was brilliant to be part of this team.
It was brilliant.
And I realized just what had happened to me at Swarthmore,
this transformation --
the ability to confront problems, complex problems,
and to design solutions to those problems.
The ability to create is the most empowering thing
that can happen to an individual.
And I was part of that.
Now, while I was at Microsoft, the annual revenues of that company
grew larger than the GDP of the Republic of Ghana.
And by the way, it's continued to.
The gap has widened since I left.
Now, I've already spoken about one of the reasons why this has occurred.
I mean, it's the people there who are so hardworking,
persistent, creative, empowered.
But there were also some external factors:
free markets, the rule of law, infrastructure.
These things were provided by institutions
run by the people that I call leaders.
And those leaders did not emerge spontaneously.
Somebody trained them to do the work that they do.
Now, while I was at Microsoft, this funny thing happened.
I became a parent.
And for the first time, Africa mattered more to me than ever before.
Because I realized that the state of the African continent
would matter to my children and their children.
That the state of the world -- the state of the world
depends on what's happening to Africa,
as far as my kids would be concerned.
And at this time, when I was going through
what I call my "pre-mid-life crisis,"
Africa was a mess.
Somalia had disintegrated into anarchy.
Rwanda was in the throes of this genocidal war.
And it seemed to me that that was the wrong direction,
and I needed to be back helping.
I couldn't just stay in Seattle and raise my kids
in an upper-middle class neighborhood and feel good about it.
This was not the world that I'd want my children to grow up in.
So I decided to get engaged, and the first thing that I did
was to come back to Ghana and talk with a lot of people
and really try to understand what the real issues were.
And three things kept coming up for every problem:
corruption, weak institutions
and the people who run them -- the leaders.
Now, I was a little scared
because when you see those three problems,
they seem really hard to deal with.
And they might say, "Look, don't even try."
But, for me, I asked the question,
"Well, where are these leaders coming from?
What is it about Ghana that produces leaders
that are unethical or unable to solve problems?"
So I went to look at what was happening in our educational system.
And it was the same -- learning by rote --
from primary school through graduate school.
Very little emphasis on ethics,
and the typical graduate
from a university in Ghana has a stronger sense
of entitlement than a sense of responsibility.
This is wrong.
So I decided to engage this particular problem.
Because it seems to me that every society, every society,
must be very intentional about how it trains its leaders.
And Ghana was not paying enough attention.
And this is true across sub-Saharan Africa, actually.
So this is what I'm doing now.
I'm trying to bring the experience that I had at Swarthmore to Africa.
I wish there was a liberal arts college in every African country.
I think it would make a huge difference.
And what Ashesi University is trying to do
is to train a new generation of ethical, entrepreneurial leaders.
We're trying to train leaders of exceptional integrity,
who have the ability to confront the complex problems,
ask the right questions, and come up with workable solutions.
I'll admit that there are times when it seems like "Mission: Impossible,"
but we must believe that these kids are smart.
That if we involve them in their education,
if we have them discuss the real issues that they confront --
that our whole society confronts --
and if we give them skills that enable them to engage the real world,
that magic will happen.
Now, a month into this project, we'd just started classes.
And a month into it, I come to the office,
and I have this email from one of our students.
And it said, very simply, "I am thinking now."
And he signs off, "Thank you."
It's such a simple statement.
But I was moved almost to tears
because I understood what was happening to this young man.
And it is an awesome thing to be a part
of empowering someone in this way.
I am thinking now.
This year we challenged our students
to craft an honor code themselves.
There's a very vibrant debate going on on campus now
over whether they should have an honor code,
and if so, what it should look like.
One of the students asked a question that just warmed my heart.
Can we create a perfect society?
Her understanding that a student-crafted honor code
constitutes a reach towards perfection is incredible.
Now, we cannot achieve perfection,
but if we reach for it, then we can achieve excellence.
I don't know ultimately what they will do.
I don't know whether they will decide to have this honor code.
But the conversation they're having now --
about what their good society should look like,
what their excellent society should look like,
is a really good thing.
Am I out of time? OK.
Now, I just wanted to leave that slide up
because it's important that we think about it.
I'm very excited about the fact
that every student at Ashesi University does community service before they graduate.
That for many of them, it has been a life-altering experience.
These young future leaders are beginning to understand
the real business of leadership,
the real privilege of leadership,
which is after all to serve humanity.
I am even more thrilled by the fact that least year
our student body elected a woman
to be the head of Student Government.
It's the first time in the history of Ghana
that a woman has been elected head of Student Government
at any university.
It says a lot about her.
It says a lot about the culture that's forming on campus.
It says a lot about her peers who elected her.
She won with 75 percent of the vote.
And it gives me a lot of hope.
It turns out that corporate West Africa
also appreciates what's happening with our students.
We've graduated two classes of students to date.
And every single one of them has been placed.
And we're getting great reports back
from corporate Ghana, corporate West Africa,
and the things that they're most impressed about is work ethic.
You know, that passion for what they're doing.
The persistence, their ability to deal with ambiguity,
their ability to tackle problems that they haven't seen before.
This is good because
over the past five years, there have been times
when I've felt this is "Mission: Impossible."
And it's just wonderful to see these glimmers
of the promise of what can happen if we train our kids right.
I think that the current and future leaders of Africa
have an incredible opportunity
to drive a major renaissance on the continent.
It's an incredible opportunity.
There aren't very many more opportunities like this in the world.
I believe that Africa has reached an inflection point
with a march of democracy and free markets across the continent.
We have reached a moment from which can emerge
a great society within one generation.
It will depend on inspired leadership.
And it is my contention that the manner in which we train our leaders
will make all the difference.
Thank you, and God bless.
(Applause)
The question today is not:
Why did we invade Afghanistan?
The question is:
why are we still in Afghanistan
one decade later?
Why are we spending
$135 billion?
Why have we got 130,000 troops on the ground?
Why were more people killed
last month
than in any preceding month
of this conflict?
How has this happened?
The last 20 years
has been the age of intervention,
and Afghanistan is simply one act
in a five-act tragedy.
We came out of the end of the Cold War
in despair.
We faced Rwanda;
we faced Bosnia,
and then we rediscovered our confidence.
In the third act, we went into Bosnia and Kosovo
and we seemed to succeed.
In the fourth act, with our hubris,
our overconfidence developing,
we invaded Iraq and Afghanistan,
and in the fifth act,
we plunged into a humiliating mess.
So the question is: What are we doing?
Why are we still stuck in Afghanistan?
And the answer, of course,
that we keep being given
is as follows:
we're told that we went into Afghanistan
because of 9/11,
and that we remain there
because the Taliban poses an existential threat
to global security.
In the words of President Obama,
"If the Taliban take over again,
they will invite back Al-Qaeda,
who will try to kill as many of our people
as they possibly can."
The story that we're told
is that there was a "light footprint" initially --
in other words, that we ended up in a situation
where we didn't have enough troops,
we didn't have enough resources,
that Afghans were frustrated --
they felt there wasn't enough progress
and economic development and security,
and therefore the Taliban came back --
that we responded in 2005 and 2006
with troop deployments,
but we still didn't put enough troops on the ground.
And that it wasn't until 2009,
when President Obama signed off on a surge,
that we finally had,
in the words of Secretary Clinton,
"the strategy, the leadership and the resources."
So, as the president now reassures us,
we are on track to achieve our goals.
All of this is wrong.
Every one of those statements is wrong.
Afghanistan does not
pose an existential threat
to global security.
It is extremely unlikely
the Taliban would ever be able to take over the country --
extremely unlikely they'd be able to seize Kabul.
They simply don't have a conventional military option.
And even if they were able to do so, even if I'm wrong,
it's extremely unlikely
the Taliban would invite back Al-Qaeda.
From the Taliban's point of view,
that was their number one mistake last time.
If they hadn't invited back Al-Qaeda,
they would still be in power today.
And even if I'm wrong about those two things,
even if they were able to take back the country,
even if they were to invite back Al-Qaeda,
it's extremely unlikely
that Al-Qaeda would significantly enhance
its ability to harm the United States
or harm Europe.
Because this isn't the 1990s anymore.
If the Al-Qaeda base
was to be established near Ghazni,
we would hit them very hard,
and it would be very, very difficult
for the Taliban to protect them.
Furthermore, it's simply not true
that what went wrong in Afghanistan
is the light footprint.
In my experience, in fact,
the light footprint was extremely helpful.
And these troops that we brought in --
it's a great picture of David Beckham
there on the sub-machine gun --
made the situation worse, not better.
When I walked across Afghanistan
in the winter of 2001-2002,
what I saw was scenes like this.
A girl, if you're lucky,
in the corner of a dark room --
lucky to be able to look at the Koran.
But in those early days
when we're told we didn't have enough troops and enough resources,
we made a lot of progress in Afghanistan.
Within a few months,
there were two and a half million more girls in school.
In Sangin where I was sick in 2002,
the nearest health clinic
was within three days walk.
Today, there are 14 health clinics
in that area alone.
There was amazing improvements.
We went from almost no Afghans
having mobile telephones during the Taliban
to a situation where, almost overnight,
three million Afghans had mobile telephones.
And we had progress in the free media.
We had progress in elections --
all of this with the so-called light footprint.
But when we began to bring more money,
when we began to invest more resources,
things got worse, not better. How?
Well first see, if you put 125 billion dollars a year
into a country like Afghanistan
where the entire revenue of the Afghan state
is one billion dollars a year,
you drown everything.
It's not simply corruption and waste
that you create;
you essentially replace the priorities of the Afghan government,
the elected Afghan government,
with the micromanaging tendencies
of foreigners on short tours
with their own priorities.
And the same is true for the troops.
When I walked across Afghanistan,
I stayed with people like this.
This is Commandant Haji Malem Mohsin Khan of Kamenj.
Commandant Haji Malem Mohsin Khan of Kamenj was a great host.
He was very generous,
like many of the Afghans I stayed with.
But he was also considerably more conservative,
considerably more anti-foreign,
considerably more Islamist
than we'd like to acknowledge.
This man, for example, Mullah Mustafa,
tried to shoot me.
And the reason I'm looking a little bit perplexed in this photograph
is I was somewhat frightened,
and I was too afraid on this occasion
to ask him, having run for an hour through the desert
and taken refuge in this house,
why he had turned up and wanted to have his photograph taken with me.
But 18 months later, I asked him
why he had tried to shoot me.
And Mullah Mustafa -- he's the man with the pen and paper --
explained that the man sitting immediately to the left as you look at the photograph,
Nadir Shah
had bet him that he couldn't hit me.
Now this is not to say
Afghanistan is a place full of people like Mullah Mustafa.
It's not; it's a wonderful place
full of incredible energy and intelligence.
But it is a place
where the putting-in of the troops
has increased the violence rather than decreased it.
2005, Anthony Fitzherbert,
an agricultural engineer,
could travel through Helmand,
could stay in Nad Ali, Sangin and Ghoresh,
which are now the names of villages where fighting is taking place.
Today, he could never do that.
So the idea that we deployed the troops
to respond to the Taliban insurgency
is mistaken.
Rather than preceding the insurgency,
the Taliban followed the troop deployment,
and as far as I'm concerned,
the troop deployment caused their return.
Now is this a new idea?
No, there have been any number of people
saying this over the last seven years.
I ran a center at Harvard
from 2008 to 2010,
and there were people like Michael Semple there
who speak Afghan languages fluently,
who've traveled to almost every district in the country.
Andrew Wilder, for example,
born on the Pakistan-Iranian border,
served his whole life
in Pakistan and Afghanistan.
Paul Fishstein who began working there in 1978 --
worked for Save the Children,
ran the Afghan research and evaluation unit.
These are people
who were able to say consistently
that the increase in development aid
was making Afghanistan less secure, not more secure --
that the counter-insurgency strategy
was not working and would not work.
And yet, nobody listened to them.
Instead,
there was a litany of astonishing optimism.
Beginning in 2004,
every general came in saying,
"I've inherited a dismal situation,
but finally I have the right resources and the correct strategy,
which will deliver,"
in General Barno's word in 2004,
the "decisive year."
Well guess what? It didn't.
But it wasn't sufficient to prevent General Abuzaid saying
that he had the strategy and the resources
to deliver, in 2005,
the "decisive year."
Or General David Richards to come in 2006
and say he had the strategy and the resources
to deliver the "crunch year."
Or in 2007,
the Norwegian deputy foreign minister, Espen Eide,
to say that that would deliver the "decisive year."
Or in 2008, Major General Champoux
to come in and say he would deliver the "decisive year."
Or in 2009, my great friend,
General Stanley McChrystal,
who said that he was "knee-deep in the decisive year."
Or in 2010,
the U.K. foreign secretary, David Miliband,
who said that at last we would deliver the "decisive year."
And you'll be delighted to hear in 2011, today,
that Guido Westerwelle, the German foreign minister,
assures us that we are in the "decisive year."
(Applause)
How do we allow
any of this to happen?
Well the answer, of course, is,
if you spend 125 billion or 130 billion
dollars a year in a country,
you co-opt almost everybody.
Even the aid agencies,
who begin to receive an enormous amount of money
from the U.S. and the European governments
to build schools and clinics,
are somewhat disinclined
to challenge the idea
that Afghanistan is an existential threat
to global security.
They're worried, in other words,
that if anybody believes that it wasn't such a threat --
Oxfam, Save the Children
wouldn't get the money
to build their hospitals and schools.
It's also very difficult to confront a general
with medals on his chest.
It's very difficult for a politician,
because you're afraid that many lives have been lost in vain.
You feel deep, deep guilt.
You exaggerate your fears,
and you're terrified about the humiliation
of defeat.
What is the solution to this?
Well the solution to this
is we need to find a way
that people like Michael Semple, or those other people,
who are telling the truth, who know the country,
who've spent 30 years on the ground --
and most importantly of all,
the missing component of this --
Afghans themselves,
who understand what is going on.
We need to somehow get their message
to the policymakers.
And this is very difficult to do
because of our structures.
The first thing we need to change
is the structures of our government.
Very, very sadly,
our foreign services, the United Nations,
the military in these countries
have very little idea of what's going on.
The average British soldier is on a tour of only six months;
Italian soldiers, on tours of four months;
the American military, on tours of 12 months.
Diplomats are locked in embassy compounds.
When they go out, they travel in these curious armored vehicles
with these somewhat threatening security teams
who ready 24 hours in advance
who say you can only stay on the ground for an hour.
In the British embassy in Afghanistan
in 2008,
an embassy of 350 people,
there were only three people who could speak Dari,
the main language of Afghanistan, at a decent level.
And there was not a single Pashto speaker.
In the Afghan section in London
responsible for governing Afghan policy on the ground,
I was told last year
that there was not a single staff member
of the foreign office in that section
who had ever served
on a posting in Afghanistan.
So we need to change that institutional culture.
And I could make the same points about the United States
and the United Nations.
Secondly, we need to aim off of the optimism of the generals.
We need to make sure that we're a little bit suspicious,
that we understand that optimism
is in the DNA of the military,
that we don't respond to it
with quite as much alacrity.
And thirdly, we need to have some humility.
We need to begin from the position
that our knowledge, our power,
our legitimacy
is limited.
This doesn't mean
that intervention around the world is a disaster.
It isn't.
Bosnia and Kosovo
were signal successes,
great successes.
Today when you go to Bosnia
it is almost impossible to believe
that what we saw in the early 1990s happened.
It's almost impossible to believe the progress we've made
since 1994.
Refugee return,
which the United Nations High Commission for Refugees
thought would be extremely unlikely,
has largely happened.
A million properties have been returned.
Borders between the Bosniak territory
and the Bosnian-Serb territory have calmed down.
The national army has shrunk.
The crime rates in Bosnia today
are lower than they are in Sweden.
This has been done
by an incredible, principled effort
by the international community,
and, of course, above all,
by Bosnians themselves.
But you need to look at context.
And this is what we've lost in Afghanistan and Iraq.
You need to understand that in those places
what really mattered
was, firstly, the role of Tudman and Milosevic
in coming to the agreement,
and then the fact those men went,
that the regional situation improved,
that the European Union could offer Bosnia
something extraordinary:
the chance to be part
of a new thing, a new club,
a chance to join something bigger.
And finally, we need to understand that in Bosnia and Kosovo,
a lot of the secret of what we did,
a lot of the secret of our success,
was our humility --
was the tentative nature of our engagement.
We criticized people a lot in Bosnia
for being quite slow to take on war criminals.
We criticized them
for being quite slow to return refugees.
But that slowness, that caution,
the fact that President Clinton initially said
that American troops would only be deployed for a year,
turned out to be a strength,
and it helped us to put our priorities right.
One of the saddest things
about our involvement in Afghanistan
is that we've got our priorities out of sync.
We're not matching our resources to our priorities.
Because if what we're interested in is terrorism,
Pakistan is far more important than Afghanistan.
If what we're interested in is regional stability,
Egypt is far more important.
If what we're worried about is poverty and development,
sub-Saharan Africa is far more important.
This doesn't mean that Afghanistan doesn't matter,
but that it's one of 40 countries in the world
with which we need to engage.
So if I can finish with a metaphor for intervention,
what we need to think of
is something like mountain rescue.
Why mountain rescue?
Because when people talk about intervention,
they imagine that some scientific theory --
the Rand Corporation goes around
counting 43 previous insurgencies
producing mathematical formula
saying you need one trained counter-insurgent
for every 20 members of the population.
This is the wrong way of looking at it.
You need to look at it in the way that you look at mountain rescue.
When you're doing mountain rescue,
you don't take a doctorate in mountain rescue,
you look for somebody who knows the terrain.
It's about context.
You understand that you can prepare,
but the amount of preparation you can do
is limited --
you can take some water, you can have a map,
you can have a pack.
But what really matters
is two kinds of problems --
problems that occur on the mountain
which you couldn't anticipate,
such as, for example, ice on a slope,
but which you can get around,
and problems which you couldn't anticipate
and which you can't get around,
like a sudden blizzard or an avalanche
or a change in the weather.
And the key to this
is a guide who has been on that mountain,
in every temperature,
at every period --
a guide who, above all,
knows when to turn back,
who doesn't press on relentlessly
when conditions turn against them.
What we look for
in firemen, in climbers, in policemen,
and what we should look for in intervention,
is intelligent risk takers --
not people who plunge blind off a cliff,
not people who jump into a burning room,
but who weigh their risks,
weigh their responsibilities.
Because the worst thing we have done in Afghanistan
is this idea
that failure is not an option.
It makes failure invisible,
inconceivable and inevitable.
And if we can resist
this crazy slogan,
we shall discover --
in Egypt, in Syria, in Libya,
and anywhere else we go in the world --
that if we can often do much less than we pretend,
we can do much more than we fear.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
Thank you. Thank you very much.
Thank you. Thank you very much.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
(Applause)
Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Bruno Giussani: Rory, you mentioned Libya at the end.
Just briefly, what's your take on the current events there
and the intervention?
Rory Stewart: Okay, I think Libya poses the classic problem.
The problem in Libya
is that we are always pushing for the black or white.
We imagine there are only two choices:
either full engagement and troop deployment
or total isolation.
And we are always being tempted up to our neck.
We put our toes in and we go up to our neck.
What we should have done in Libya
is we should have stuck to the U.N. resolution.
We should have limited ourselves very, very strictly
to the protection of the civilian population in Benghazi.
We could have done that.
We set up a no-fly zone within 48 hours
because Gaddafi had no planes
within 48 hours.
Instead of which, we've allowed ourselves to be tempted
towards regime change.
In doing so, we've destroyed our credibility with the Security Council,
which means it's very difficult
to get a resolution on Syria,
and we're setting ourselves up again for failure.
Once more, humility,
limits, honesty,
realistic expectations
and we could have achieved something to be proud of.
BG: Rory, thank you very much.
RS: Thank you. (BG: Thank you.)
This is an equipment graveyard.
It's a typical final resting place
for medical equipment
from hospitals in Africa.
Now, why is this?
Most of the medical devices
used in Africa are imported,
and quite often, they're not suitable
for local conditions.
They may require trained staff
that aren't available to operate
and maintain and repair them;
they may not be able to withstand
high temperatures and humidity;
and they usually require a constant
and reliable supply of electricity.
An example of a medical device
that may have ended up
in an equipment graveyard at some point
is an ultrasound monitor
to track the heart rate of unborn babies.
This is the standard of care
in rich countries.
In low-resource settings,
the standard of care is often
a midwife listening
to the baby's heart rate
through a horn.
Now, this approach has been around
for more than a century.
It's very much dependent on the skill
and the experience of the midwife.
Two young inventors from Uganda
visited an antenatal clinic
at a local hospital a few years ago,
when they were students
in information technology.
They noticed that quite often,
the midwife was not able
to hear any heart rate
when trying to listen to it
through this horn.
So they invented their own
fetal heart rate monitor.
They adapted the horn
and connected it to a smartphone.
An app on the smartphone
records the heart rate, analyzes it
and provides the midwife
with a range of information
on the status of the baby.
These inventors --
(Applause)
are called Aaron Tushabe
and Joshua Okello.
Another inventor, Tendekayi Katsiga,
was working for an NGO in Botswana
that manufactured hearing aids.
Now, he noticed that
these hearing aids needed batteries
that needed replacement,
very often at a cost
that was not affordable
for most of the users that he knew.
In response, and being an engineer,
Tendekayi invented
a solar-powered battery charger
with rechargeable batteries,
that could be used in these hearing aids.
He cofounded a company called Deaftronics,
which now manufactures the Solar Ear,
which is a hearing aid powered
by his invention.
My colleague, Sudesh Sivarasu,
invented a smart glove
for people who have suffered from leprosy.
Even though their disease
may have been cured,
the resulting nerve damage
will have left many of them
without a sense of touch in their hands.
This puts them at risk of injury.
The glove has sensors
to detect temperature and pressure
and warn the user.
It effectively serves
as an artificial sense of touch
and prevents injury.
Sudesh invented this glove
after observing former leprosy patients
as they carried out
their day-to-day activities,
and he learned about the risks
and the hazards in their environment.
Now, the inventors that I've mentioned
integrated engineering with healthcare.
This is what biomedical engineers do.
At the University of Cape Town,
we run a course called
Health Innovation and Design.
It's taken by many of our graduate
students in biomedical engineering.
The aim of the course
is to introduce these students
to the philosophy of the design world.
The students are encouraged
to engage with communities
as they search for solutions
to health-related problems.
One of the communities that we work with
is a group of elderly people
in Cape Town.
A recent class project had the task
of addressing hearing loss
in these elderly people.
The students, many of them
being engineers,
set out believing that they
would design a better hearing aid.
They spent time with the elderly,
chatted to their healthcare providers
and their caregivers.
They soon realized that, actually,
adequate hearing aids already existed,
but many of the elderly who needed them
and had access to them
didn't have them.
And many of those who had hearing aids
wouldn't wear them.
The students realized
that many of these elderly people
were in denial of their hearing loss.
There's a stigma attached
to wearing a hearing aid.
They also discovered that the environment
in which these elderly people lived
did not accommodate their hearing loss.
For example, their homes
and their community center
were filled with echoes
that interfered with their hearing.
So instead of developing and designing
a new and better hearing aid,
the students did an audit
of the environment,
with a view to improving the acoustics.
They also devised a campaign
to raise awareness of hearing loss
and to counter the stigma
attached to wearing a hearing aid.
Now, this often happens
when one pays attention to the user --
in this case, the elderly --
and their needs and their context.
One often has to move away
from the focus of technology
and reformulate the problem.
This approach to understanding a problem
through listening and engaging
is not new,
but it often isn't followed by engineers,
who are intent on developing technology.
One of our students has a background
in software engineering.
He had often created products for clients
that the client ultimately did not like.
When a client would reject a product,
it was common at his company
to proclaim that the client
just didn't know what they wanted.
Having completed the course,
the student fed back to us
that he now realized
that it was he who hadn't understood
what the client wanted.
Another student gave us feedback
that she had learned
to design with empathy,
as opposed to designing for functionality,
which is what her engineering
education had taught her.
So what all of this illustrates is that
we're often blinded to real needs
in our pursuit of technology.
But we need technology.
We need hearing aids.
We need fetal heart rate monitors.
So how do we create more medical device
success stories from Africa?
How do we create more inventors,
rather than relying on
a few exceptional individuals
who are able to perceive real needs
and respond in ways that work?
Well, we focus on needs
and people and context.
"But this is obvious," you might say,
"Of course context is important."
But Africa is a diverse continent,
with vast disparities in health and wealth
and income and education.
If we assume that our engineers
and inventors already know enough
about the different African contexts
to be able to solve the problems
of our different communities
and our most marginalized communities,
then we might get it wrong.
But then, if we on the African continent
don't necessarily know enough about it,
then perhaps anybody with the right level
of skill and commitment could fly in,
spend some time listening and engaging
and fly out knowing enough
to invent for Africa.
But understanding context is not about
a superficial interaction.
It's about deep engagement
and an immersion in the realities
and the complexities of our context.
And we in Africa are already immersed.
We already have a strong and rich
base of knowledge
from which to start finding solutions
to our own problems.
So let's not rely too much on others
when we live on a continent
that is filled with untapped talent.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Imagine, if you will -- a gift.
I'd like for you to picture it in your mind.
It's not too big --
about the size of a golf ball.
So envision what it looks like all wrapped up.
But before I show you what's inside,
I will tell you, it's going to do incredible things for you.
It will bring all of your family together.
You will feel loved and appreciated like never before
and reconnect with friends and acquaintances
you haven't heard from in years.
Adoration and admiration
will overwhelm you.
It will recalibrate what's most important in your life.
It will redefine your sense
of spirituality and faith.
You'll have a new understanding
and trust in your body.
You'll have unsurpassed vitality and energy.
You'll expand your vocabulary,
meet new people,
and you'll have a healthier lifestyle.
And get this --
you'll have an eight-week vacation
of doing absolutely nothing.
You'll eat countless gourmet meals.
Flowers will arrive by the truckload.
People will say to you,
"You look great. Have you had any work done?"
And you'll have a lifetime supply
of good drugs.
You'll be challenged, inspired,
motivated and humbled.
Your life will have new meaning.
Peace, health,
serenity, happiness,
nirvana.
The price?
$55,000,
and that's an incredible deal.
By now I know you're dying to know
what it is and where you can get one.
Does Amazon carry it?
Does it have the Apple logo on it?
Is there a waiting list?
Not likely.
This gift came to me about five months ago.
It looked more like this when it was all wrapped up --
not quite so pretty.
And this,
and then this.
It was a rare gem --
a brain tumor,
hemangioblastoma --
the gift that keeps on giving.
And while I'm okay now,
I wouldn't wish this gift for you.
I'm not sure you'd want it.
But I wouldn't change my experience.
It profoundly altered my life
in ways I didn't expect
in all the ways I just shared with you.
So the next time you're faced
with something that's unexpected,
unwanted and uncertain,
consider
that it just may be a gift.
(Applause)
There are no bad buttons,
there are only bad people.
How does that sound? OK?
[Small thing.]
[Big idea.]
[Isaac Mizrahi on
the Button]
No one knows who invented the button.
It might have shown up
as early as 2000 BCE.
It was decorative when it first started,
just something pretty
sewn onto your clothes.
Then about 3,000 years later,
someone finally invented the buttonhole,
and buttons were suddenly useful.
The button and the buttonhole
is such a great invention.
Not only does it slip
through the buttonhole,
but then it kind of falls into place,
and so you're completely secure,
like it's never going to open.
The design of a button hasn't changed much
since the Middle Ages.
It's one of the most enduring
designs in history.
For me, the best buttons
are usually round.
There's either a dome button
with a little shank,
or there's just this sort of round thing
with either a rim or not a rim,
either two holes or four holes.
Almost more important than the button
is the buttonhole.
And the way you figure that out is:
the diameter of the button
plus the width of the button,
plus a little bit of ease.
Before buttons, clothes were bigger --
they were more kind of amorphous,
and people, like, wriggled into them
or just kind of wrapped
themselves in things.
But then fashion moved closer to the body
as we discovered uses for the button.
At one time, it was the one way
to make clothes fit against the body.
I think the reason buttons have endured
for so long, historically,
is because they actually work
to keep our clothes shut.
Zippers break;
Velcro makes a lot of noise,
and it wears out after a while.
If a button falls off,
you just literally sew that thing on.
A button is kind of there
for the long run.
It's not just the most
elemental design ever,
it's also such a crazy fashion statement.
When I was a kid, my mom knit me
this beautiful sweater.
I didn't like it.
And then I found these buttons,
and the minute the buttons were
on the sweater, I loved it.
If you don't have good taste
and you can't pick out a button,
then let someone else do it, you know?
I mean that.
In the past few months, I've been
traveling for weeks at a time
with only one suitcase of clothes.
One day, I was invited
to an important event,
and I wanted to wear
something special and new for it.
So I looked through my suitcase
and I couldn't find anything to wear.
I was lucky to be at the technology
conference on that day,
and I had access to 3D printers.
So I quickly designed
a skirt on my computer,
and I loaded the file on the printer.
It just printed the pieces overnight.
The next morning,
I just took all the pieces,
assembled them together in my hotel room,
and this is actually the skirt
that I'm wearing right now.
(Applause)
So it wasn't the first time
that I printed clothes.
For my senior collection
at fashion design school,
I decided to try and 3D print
an entire fashion collection from my home.
The problem was that I barely knew
anything about 3D printing,
and I had only nine months to figure out
how to print five fashionable looks.
I always felt most creative
when I worked from home.
I loved experimenting with new materials,
and I always tried
to develop new techniques
to make the most unique textiles
for my fashion projects.
I loved going to old factories
and weird stores
in search of leftovers
of strange powders and weird materials,
and then bring them home to experiment on.
As you can probably imagine,
my roommates didn't like that at all.
(Laughter)
So I decided to move on
to working with big machines,
ones that didn't fit in my living room.
I love the exact
and the custom work I can do
with all kinds of fashion technologies,
like knitting machines
and laser cutting and silk printing.
One summer break, I came here
to New York for an internship
at a fashion house in Chinatown.
We worked on two incredible dresses
that were 3D printed.
They were amazing --
like you can see here.
But I had a few issues with them.
They were made from hard plastics
and that's why they were very breakable.
The models couldn't sit in them,
and they even got scratched
from the plastics under their arms.
With 3D printing, the designers
had so much freedom
to make the dresses look
exactly like they wanted,
but still, they were very dependent
on big and expensive industrial printers
that were located in a lab
far from their studio.
Later that year, a friend gave me
a 3D printed necklace,
printed using a home printer.
I knew that these printers
were much cheaper
and much more accessible
than the ones we used at my internship.
So I looked at the necklace,
and then I thought, "If I can
print a necklace from home,
why not print my clothes from home, too?"
I really liked the idea that I wouldn't
have to go to the market
and pick fabrics that
someone else chose to sell --
I could just design them
and print them directly from home.
I found a small makerspace,
where I learned everything
I know about 3D printing.
Right away, they literally
gave me the key to the lab,
so I could experiment
into the night, every night.
The main challenge was to find the right
filament for printing clothes with.
So what is a filament?
Filament is the material
you feed the printer with.
And I spent a month or so
experimenting with PLA,
which is a hard and scratchy,
breakable material.
The breakthrough came
when I was introduced to Filaflex,
which is a new kind of filament.
It's strong, yet very flexible.
And with it, I was able to print
the first garment,
the red jacket that had
the word "Liberté" --
"freedom" in French --
embedded into it.
I chose this word because I felt
so empowered and free
when I could just design
a garment from my home
and then print it by myself.
And actually, you can easily
download this jacket,
and easily change the word
to something else.
For example, your name
or your sweetheart's name.
(Laughter)
So the printer plates are small,
so I had to piece the garment
together, just like a puzzle.
And I wanted to solve another challenge.
I wanted to print textiles
that I would use
just like regular fabrics.
That's when I found an open-source file
from an architect who designed
a pattern that I love.
And with it, I was able to print
a beautiful textile
that I would use
just like a regular fabric.
And it actually even looks
a little bit like lace.
So I took his file and I modified it,
and changed it, played with it --
many kinds of versions out of it.
And I needed to print
another 1,500 more hours
to complete printing my collection.
So I brought six printers to my home
and just printed 24-7.
And this is actually
a really slow process,
but let's remember the Internet
was significantly slower 20 years ago,
so 3D printing will also accelerate
and in no time you'll be able to print
a T-Shirt in your home
in just a couple of hours,
or even minutes.
So you guys, you want to see
what it looks like?
Audience: Yeah!
(Applause)
Danit Peleg: Rebecca is wearing
one of my five outfits.
Almost everything here she's wearing,
I printed from my home.
Even her shoes are printed.
Audience: Wow!
Audience: Cool!
(Applause)
Danit Peleg: Thank you, Rebecca.
(To audience) Thank you, guys.
So I think in the future,
materials will evolve,
and they will look and feel
like fabrics we know today,
like cotton or silk.
Imagine personalized clothes
that fit exactly to your measurements.
Music was once a very physical thing.
You would have to go
to the record shop and buy CDs,
but now you can just download the music --
digital music --
directly to your phone.
Fashion is also a very physical thing.
And I wonder what our world will look like
when our clothes will be digital,
just like this skirt is.
Thank you so much.
(Applause)
[Thank You]
(Applause)
The most massive
tsunami perfect storm
is bearing down upon us.
This perfect storm
is mounting a grim reality, increasingly grim reality,
and we are facing that reality
with the full belief
that we can solve our problems with technology,
and that's very understandable.
Now, this perfect storm that we are facing
is the result of our rising population,
rising towards 10 billion people,
land that is turning to desert,
and, of course, climate change.
Now there's no question about it at all:
we will only solve the problem
of replacing fossil fuels with technology.
But fossil fuels, carbon -- coal and gas --
are by no means the only thing
that is causing climate change.
Desertification
is a fancy word for land that is turning to desert,
and this happens only when
we create too much bare ground.
There's no other cause.
And I intend to focus
on most of the world's land that is turning to desert.
But I have for you a very simple message
that offers more hope than you can imagine.
We have environments
where humidity is guaranteed throughout the year.
On those, it is almost impossible
to create vast areas of bare ground.
No matter what you do, nature covers it up so quickly.
And we have environments
where we have months of humidity
followed by months of dryness,
and that is where desertification is occurring.
Fortunately, with space technology now,
we can look at it from space,
and when we do, you can see the proportions fairly well.
Generally, what you see in green
is not desertifying,
and what you see in brown is,
and these are by far the greatest areas of the Earth.
About two thirds, I would guess, of the world is desertifying.
I took this picture in the Tihamah Desert
while 25 millimeters -- that's an inch of rain -- was falling.
Think of it in terms of drums of water,
each containing 200 liters.
Over 1,000 drums of water fell on every hectare
of that land that day.
The next day, the land looked like this.
Where had that water gone?
Some of it ran off as flooding,
but most of the water that soaked into the soil
simply evaporated out again,
exactly as it does in your garden
if you leave the soil uncovered.
Now, because the fate of water and carbon
are tied to soil organic matter,
when we damage soils, you give off carbon.
Carbon goes back to the atmosphere.
Now you're told over and over, repeatedly,
that desertification is only occurring
in arid and semi-arid areas of the world,
and that tall grasslands like this one
in high rainfall are of no consequence.
But if you do not look at grasslands but look down into them,
you find that most of the soil in that grassland
that you've just seen is bare and covered with a crust of algae,
leading to increased runoff and evaporation.
That is the cancer of desertification
that we do not recognize till its terminal form.
Now we know that desertification is caused by livestock,
mostly cattle, sheep and goats,
overgrazing the plants,
leaving the soil bare and giving off methane.
Almost everybody knows this,
from nobel laureates to golf caddies,
or was taught it, as I was.
Now, the environments like you see here,
dusty environments in Africa where I grew up,
and I loved wildlife,
and so I grew up hating livestock
because of the damage they were doing.
And then my university education as an ecologist
reinforced my beliefs.
Well, I have news for you.
We were once just as certain
that the world was flat.
We were wrong then, and we are wrong again.
And I want to invite you now
to come along on my journey of reeducation and discovery.
When I was a young man,
a young biologist in Africa,
I was involved in setting aside marvelous areas
as future national parks.
Now no sooner — this was in the 1950s —
and no sooner did we remove the hunting,
drum-beating people to protect the animals,
than the land began to deteriorate,
as you see in this park that we formed.
Now, no livestock were involved,
but suspecting that we had too many elephants now,
I did the research and I proved we had too many,
and I recommended that we would have to reduce their numbers
and bring them down to a level that the land could sustain.
Now, that was a terrible decision for me to have to make,
and it was political dynamite, frankly.
So our government formed a team of experts
to evaluate my research.
They did. They agreed with me,
and over the following years,
we shot 40,000 elephants to try to stop the damage.
And it got worse, not better.
Loving elephants as I do,
that was the saddest and greatest blunder of my life,
and I will carry that to my grave.
One good thing did come out of it.
It made me absolutely determined
to devote my life to finding solutions.
When I came to the United States, I got a shock,
to find national parks like this one
desertifying as badly as anything in Africa.
And there'd been no livestock on this land
for over 70 years.
And I found that American scientists
had no explanation for this
except that it is arid and natural.
So I then began looking
at all the research plots I could
over the whole of the Western United States
where cattle had been removed
to prove that it would stop desertification,
but I found the opposite,
as we see on this research station,
where this grassland that was green in 1961,
by 2002 had changed to that situation.
And the authors of the position paper on climate change
from which I obtained these pictures
attribute this change to "unknown processes."
Clearly, we have never understood
what is causing desertification,
which has destroyed many civilizations
and now threatens us globally.
We have never understood it.
Take one square meter of soil
and make it bare like this is down here,
and I promise you, you will find it much colder at dawn
and much hotter at midday
than that same piece of ground if it's just covered with litter,
plant litter.
You have changed the microclimate.
Now, by the time you are doing that
and increasing greatly the percentage of bare ground
on more than half the world's land,
you are changing macroclimate.
But we have just simply not understood
why was it beginning to happen 10,000 years ago?
Why has it accelerated lately?
We had no understanding of that.
What we had failed to understand
was that these seasonal humidity environments of the world,
the soil and the vegetation
developed with very large numbers of grazing animals,
and that these grazing animals
developed with ferocious pack-hunting predators.
Now, the main defense against pack-hunting predators
is to get into herds,
and the larger the herd, the safer the individuals.
Now, large herds dung and urinate all over their own food,
and they have to keep moving,
and it was that movement
that prevented the overgrazing of plants,
while the periodic trampling
ensured good cover of the soil,
as we see where a herd has passed.
This picture is a typical seasonal grassland.
It has just come through four months of rain,
and it's now going into eight months of dry season.
And watch the change as it goes into this long dry season.
Now, all of that grass you see aboveground
has to decay biologically
before the next growing season, and if it doesn't,
the grassland and the soil begin to die.
Now, if it does not decay biologically,
it shifts to oxidation, which is a very slow process,
and this smothers and kills grasses,
leading to a shift to woody vegetation
and bare soil, releasing carbon.
To prevent that, we have traditionally used fire.
But fire also leaves the soil bare, releasing carbon,
and worse than that,
burning one hectare of grassland
gives off more, and more damaging, pollutants
than 6,000 cars.
And we are burning in Africa, every single year,
more than one billion hectares of grasslands,
and almost nobody is talking about it.
We justify the burning, as scientists,
because it does remove the dead material
and it allows the plants to grow.
Now, looking at this grassland of ours that has gone dry,
what could we do to keep that healthy?
And bear in mind, I'm talking of most of the world's land now.
Okay? We cannot reduce animal numbers to rest it more
without causing desertification and climate change.
We cannot burn it without causing
desertification and climate change.
What are we going to do?
There is only one option,
I'll repeat to you, only one option
left to climatologists and scientists,
and that is to do the unthinkable,
and to use livestock,
bunched and moving,
as a proxy for former herds and predators,
and mimic nature.
There is no other alternative left to mankind.
So let's do that.
So on this bit of grassland, we'll do it, but just in the foreground.
We'll impact it very heavily with cattle to mimic nature,
and we've done so, and look at that.
All of that grass is now covering the soil
as dung, urine and litter or mulch,
as every one of the gardeners amongst you would understand,
and that soil is ready to absorb and hold the rain,
to store carbon, and to break down methane.
And we did that,
without using fire to damage the soil,
and the plants are free to grow.
When I first realized
that we had no option as scientists
but to use much-vilified livestock
to address climate change and desertification,
I was faced with a real dilemma.
How were we to do it?
We'd had 10,000 years of extremely knowledgeable pastoralists
bunching and moving their animals,
but they had created the great manmade deserts of the world.
Then we'd had 100 years of modern rain science,
and that had accelerated desertification,
as we first discovered in Africa
and then confirmed in the United States,
and as you see in this picture
of land managed by the federal government.
Clearly more was needed
than bunching and moving the animals,
and humans, over thousands of years,
had never been able to deal with nature's complexity.
But we biologists and ecologists
had never tackled anything as complex as this.
So rather than reinvent the wheel,
I began studying other professions to see if anybody had.
And I found there were planning techniques
that I could take and adapt to our biological need,
and from those I developed what we call
holistic management and planned grazing,
a planning process,
and that does address all of nature's complexity
and our social, environmental, economic complexity.
Today, we have young women like this one
teaching villages in Africa
how to put their animals together into larger herds,
plan their grazing to mimic nature,
and where we have them hold their animals overnight --
we run them in a predator-friendly manner,
because we have a lot of lands, and so on --
and where they do this and hold them overnight
to prepare the crop fields,
we are getting very great increases in crop yield as well.
Let's look at some results.
This is land close to land that we manage in Zimbabwe.
It has just come through four months of very good rains
it got that year, and it's going into the long dry season.
But as you can see, all of that rain, almost of all it,
has evaporated from the soil surface.
Their river is dry despite the rain just having ended,
and we have 150,000 people
on almost permanent food aid.
Now let's go to our land nearby on the same day,
with the same rainfall, and look at that.
Our river is flowing and healthy and clean.
It's fine.
The production of grass, shrubs, trees, wildlife,
everything is now more productive,
and we have virtually no fear of dry years.
And we did that by increasing the cattle and goats
400 percent,
planning the grazing to mimic nature
and integrate them with all the elephants, buffalo,
giraffe and other animals that we have.
But before we began, our land looked like that.
This site was bare and eroding for over 30 years
regardless of what rain we got.
Okay? Watch the marked tree and see the change
as we use livestock to mimic nature.
This was another site
where it had been bare and eroding,
and at the base of the marked small tree,
we had lost over 30 centimeters of soil. Okay?
And again, watch the change
just using livestock to mimic nature.
And there are fallen trees in there now,
because the better land is now attracting elephants, etc.
This land in Mexico was in terrible condition,
and I've had to mark the hill
because the change is so profound.
(Applause)
I began helping a family in the Karoo Desert in the 1970s
turn the desert that you see on the right there
back to grassland,
and thankfully, now their grandchildren are on the land
with hope for the future.
And look at the amazing change in this one,
where that gully has completely healed
using nothing but livestock mimicking nature,
and once more, we have the third generation of that family
on that land with their flag still flying.
The vast grasslands of Patagonia
are turning to desert as you see here.
The man in the middle is an Argentinian researcher,
and he has documented the steady decline of that land
over the years as they kept reducing sheep numbers.
They put 25,000 sheep in one flock,
really mimicking nature now with planned grazing,
and they have documented a 50-percent increase
in the production of the land in the first year.
We now have in the violent Horn of Africa
pastoralists planning their grazing to mimic nature
and openly saying it is the only hope they have
of saving their families and saving their culture.
Ninety-five percent of that land
can only feed people from animals.
I remind you that I am talking about
most of the world's land here that controls our fate,
including the most violent region of the world,
where only animals can feed people
from about 95 percent of the land.
What we are doing globally is causing climate change
as much as, I believe, fossil fuels,
and maybe more than fossil fuels.
But worse than that, it is causing hunger, poverty,
violence, social breakdown and war,
and as I am talking to you,
millions of men, women and children
are suffering and dying.
And if this continues,
we are unlikely to be able to stop the climate changing,
even after we have eliminated the use of fossil fuels.
I believe I've shown you how we can work with nature
at very low cost
to reverse all this.
We are already doing so
on about 15 million hectares
on five continents,
and people who understand
far more about carbon than I do
calculate that, for illustrative purposes,
if we do what I am showing you here,
we can take enough carbon out of the atmosphere
and safely store it in the grassland soils
for thousands of years,
and if we just do that on about half the world's grasslands
that I've shown you,
we can take us back to pre-industrial levels,
while feeding people.
I can think of almost nothing
that offers more hope for our planet,
for your children,
and their children, and all of humanity.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Thank you. (Applause)
Thank you, Chris.
Chris Anderson: Thank you. I have,
and I'm sure everyone here has,
A) a hundred questions, B) wants to hug you.
I'm just going to ask you one quick question.
When you first start this and you bring in a flock of animals,
it's desert. What do they eat? How does that part work?
How do you start?
Allan Savory: Well, we have done this for a long time,
and the only time we have ever had to provide any feed
is during mine reclamation,
where it's 100 percent bare.
But many years ago, we took the worst land in Zimbabwe,
where I offered a £5 note
in a hundred-mile drive
if somebody could find one grass
in a hundred-mile drive,
and on that, we trebled the stocking rate,
the number of animals, in the first year with no feeding,
just by the movement, mimicking nature,
and using a sigmoid curve, that principle.
It's a little bit technical to explain here, but just that.
CA: Well, I would love to -- I mean, this such an interesting and important idea.
The best people on our blog are going to come and talk to you
and try and -- I want to get more on this
that we could share along with the talk.AS: Wonderful.
CA: That is an astonishing talk, truly an astonishing talk,
and I think you heard that we all are cheering you on your way.
Thank you so much.AS: Well, thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Chris.
(Applause)
As patients,
we usually remember
the names of our doctors,
but often we forget
the names of our nurses.
I remember one.
I had breast cancer a few years ago,
and somehow I managed
to get through the surgeries
and the beginning
of the treatment just fine.
I could hide what was going on.
Everybody didn't really have to know.
I could walk my daughter to school,
I could go out to dinner with my husband;
I could fool people.
But then my chemo was scheduled to begin
and that terrified me
because I knew that I was going to lose
every single hair on my body
because of the kind of chemo
that I was going to have.
I wasn't going to be able
to pretend anymore
as though everything was normal.
I was scared.
I knew what it felt like to have
everybody treating me with kid gloves,
and I just wanted to feel normal.
I had a port installed in my chest.
I went to my first day of chemotherapy,
and I was an emotional wreck.
My nurse, Joanne, walked in the door,
and every bone in my body was telling
me to get up out of that chair
and take for the hills.
But Joanne looked at me and talked
to me like we were old friends.
And then she asked me,
"Where'd you get your highlights done?"
(Laughter)
And I was like, are you kidding me?
You're going to talk to me about my hair
when I'm on the verge of losing it?
I was kind of angry,
and I said, "Really? Hair?"
And with a shrug
of her shoulders she said,
"It's gonna grow back."
And in that moment she said
the one thing I had overlooked,
and that was that at some point,
my life would get back to normal.
She really believed that.
And so I believed it, too.
Now, worrying about losing your hair
when you're fighting cancer
may seem silly at first,
but it's not just that you're worried
about how you're going to look.
It's that you're worried that everybody's
going to treat you so carefully.
Joanne made me feel normal
for the first time in six months.
We talked about her boyfriends,
we talked about looking
for apartments in New York City,
and we talked about my reaction
to the chemotherapy --
all kind of mixed in together.
And I always wondered,
how did she so instinctively
know just how to talk to me?
Joanne Staha and my admiration for her
marked the beginning of my journey
into the world of nurses.
A few years later,
I was asked to do a project
that would celebrate
the work that nurses do.
I started with Joanne,
and I met over 100 nurses
across the country.
I spent five years interviewing,
photographing and filming nurses
for a book and a documentary film.
With my team,
we mapped a trip across America
that would take us to places
dealing with some of the biggest
public health issues facing our nation --
aging, war, poverty, prisons.
And then we went places
where we would find
the largest concentration of patients
dealing with those issues.
Then we asked hospitals and facilities
to nominate nurses
who would best represent them.
One of the first nurses I met
was Bridget Kumbella.
Bridget was born in Cameroon,
the oldest of four children.
Her father was at work
when he had fallen from the fourth floor
and really hurt his back.
And he talked a lot about what it was like
to be flat on your back
and not get the kind
of care that you need.
And that propelled Bridget
to go into the profession of nursing.
Now, as a nurse in the Bronx,
she has a really diverse group
of patients that she cares for,
from all walks of life,
and from all different religions.
And she's devoted her career
to understanding the impact
of our cultural differences
when it comes to our health.
She spoke of a patient --
a Native American patient that she had --
that wanted to bring
a bunch of feathers into the ICU.
That's how he found spiritual comfort.
And she spoke of advocating for him
and said that patients come
from all different religions
and use all different kinds
of objects for comfort;
whether it's a holy rosary
or a symbolic feather,
it all needs to be supported.
This is Jason Short.
Jason is a home health nurse
in the Appalachian mountains,
and his dad had a gas station
and a repair shop when he was growing up.
So he worked on cars in the community
that he now serves as a nurse.
When he was in college,
it was just not macho at all
to become a nurse,
so he avoided it for years.
He drove trucks for a little while,
but his life path was always
pulling him back to nursing.
As a nurse in the Appalachian mountains,
Jason goes places
that an ambulance can't even get to.
In this photograph,
he's standing in what used to be a road.
Top of the mountain mining
flooded that road,
and now the only way
for Jason to get to the patient
living in that house
with black lung disease
is to drive his SUV
against the current up that creek.
The day I was with him,
we ripped the front fender off the car.
The next morning he got up,
put the car on the lift,
fixed the fender,
and then headed out
to meet his next patient.
I witnessed Jason
caring for this gentleman
with such enormous compassion,
and I was struck again by how intimate
the work of nursing really is.
When I met Brian McMillion, he was raw.
He had just come back from a deployment
and he hadn't really settled back in
to life in San Diego yet.
He talked about his experience
of being a nurse in Germany
and taking care of the soldiers
coming right off the battlefield.
Very often, he would be
the first person they would see
when they opened
their eyes in the hospital.
And they would look at him
as they were lying there,
missing limbs,
and the first thing they would say is,
"When can I go back?
I left my brothers out there."
And Brian would have to say,
"You're not going anywhere.
You've already given enough, brother."
Brian is both a nurse and a soldier
who's seen combat.
So that puts him in a unique position
to be able to relate to and help heal
the veterans in his care.
This is Sister Stephen,
and she runs a nursing home
in Wisconsin called Villa Loretto.
And the entire circle of life
can be found under her roof.
She grew up wishing they lived on a farm,
so given the opportunity
to adopt local farm animals,
she enthusiastically brings them in.
And in the springtime,
those animals have babies.
And Sister Stephen uses
those baby ducks, goats and lambs
as animal therapy
for the residents at Villa Loretto
who sometimes can't
remember their own name,
but they do rejoice
in the holding of a baby lamb.
The day I was with Sister Stephen,
I needed to take her away
from Villa Loretto
to film part of her story.
And before we left,
she went into the room of a dying patient.
And she leaned over and she said,
"I have to go away for the day,
but if Jesus calls you,
you go.
You go straight home to Jesus."
I was standing there and thinking
it was the first time in my life
I witnessed that you could show
someone you love them completely
by letting go.
We don't have to hold on so tightly.
I saw more life rolled up at Villa Loretto
than I have ever seen at any other time
at any other place in my life.
We live in a complicated time
when it comes to our health care.
It's easy to lose sight
of the need for quality of life,
not just quantity of life.
As new life-saving
technologies are created,
we're going to have really
complicated decisions to make.
These technologies often save lives,
but they can also prolong pain
and the dying process.
How in the world are we supposed
to navigate these waters?
We're going to need
all the help we can get.
Nurses have a really unique
relationship with us
because of the time spent at bedside.
During that time,
a kind of emotional intimacy develops.
This past summer, on August 9,
my father died of a heart attack.
My mother was devastated,
and she couldn't imagine
her world without him in it.
Four days later she fell,
she broke her hip,
she needed surgery
and she found herself
fighting for her own life.
Once again I found myself
on the receiving end
of the care of nurses --
this time for my mom.
My brother and my sister and I
stayed by her side
for the next three days in the ICU.
And as we tried
to make the right decisions
and follow my mother's wishes,
we found that we were depending
upon the guidance of nurses.
And once again,
they didn't let us down.
They had an amazing insight
in terms of how to care for my mom
in the last four days of her life.
They brought her comfort
and relief from pain.
They knew to encourage my sister and I
to put a pretty nightgown on my mom,
long after it mattered to her,
but it sure meant a lot to us.
And they knew to come and wake me up
just in time for my mom's last breath.
And then they knew
how long to leave me in the room
with my mother after she died.
I have no idea how they know these things,
but I do know that I am eternally grateful
that they've guided me once again.
Thank you so very much.
(Applause)
I'd like to begin with a thought experiment.
Imagine that it's 4,000 years into the future.
Civilization as we know it
has ceased to exist --
no books,
no electronic devices,
no Facebook or Twitter.
All knowledge of the English language and the English alphabet
has been lost.
Now imagine archeologists
digging through the rubble of one of our cities.
What might they find?
Well perhaps some rectangular pieces of plastic
with strange symbols on them.
Perhaps some circular pieces of metal.
Maybe some cylindrical containers
with some symbols on them.
And perhaps one archeologist becomes an instant celebrity
when she discovers --
buried in the hills somewhere in North America --
massive versions of these same symbols.
Now let's ask ourselves,
what could such artifacts say about us
to people 4,000 years into the future?
This is no hypothetical question.
In fact, this is exactly the kind of question we're faced with
when we try to understand the Indus Valley civilization,
which existed 4,000 years ago.
The Indus civilization was roughly contemporaneous
with the much better known Egyptian and the Mesopotamian civilizations,
but it was actually much larger than either of these two civilizations.
It occupied the area
of approximately one million square kilometers,
covering what is now Pakistan,
Northwestern India
and parts of Afghanistan and Iran.
Given that it was such a vast civilization,
you might expect to find really powerful rulers, kings,
and huge monuments glorifying these powerful kings.
In fact,
what archeologists have found is none of that.
They've found small objects such as these.
Here's an example of one of these objects.
Well obviously this is a replica.
But who is this person?
A king? A god?
A priest?
Or perhaps an ordinary person
like you or me?
We don't know.
But the Indus people also left behind artifacts with writing on them.
Well no, not pieces of plastic,
but stone seals, copper tablets,
pottery and, surprisingly,
one large sign board,
which was found buried near the gate of a city.
Now we don't know if it says Hollywood,
or even Bollywood for that matter.
In fact, we don't even know
what any of these objects say,
and that's because the Indus script is undeciphered.
We don't know what any of these symbols mean.
The symbols are most commonly found on seals.
So you see up there one such object.
It's the square object with the unicorn-like animal on it.
Now that's a magnificent piece of art.
So how big do you think that is?
Perhaps that big?
Or maybe that big?
Well let me show you.
Here's a replica of one such seal.
It's only about one inch by one inch in size --
pretty tiny.
So what were these used for?
We know that these were used for stamping clay tags
that were attached to bundles of goods that were sent from one place to the other.
So you know those packing slips you get on your FedEx boxes?
These were used to make those kinds of packing slips.
You might wonder what these objects contain
in terms of their text.
Perhaps they're the name of the sender
or some information about the goods
that are being sent from one place to the other -- we don't know.
We need to decipher the script to answer that question.
Deciphering the script
is not just an intellectual puzzle;
it's actually become a question
that's become deeply intertwined
with the politics and the cultural history of South Asia.
In fact, the script has become a battleground of sorts
between three different groups of people.
First, there's a group of people
who are very passionate in their belief
that the Indus script
does not represent a language at all.
These people believe that the symbols
are very similar to the kind of symbols you find on traffic signs
or the emblems you find on shields.
There's a second group of people
who believe that the Indus script represents an Indo-European language.
If you look at a map of India today,
you'll see that most of the languages spoken in North India
belong to the Indo-European language family.
So some people believe that the Indus script
represents an ancient Indo-European language such as Sanskrit.
There's a last group of people
who believe that the Indus people
were the ancestors of people living in South India today.
These people believe that the Indus script
represents an ancient form
of the Dravidian language family,
which is the language family spoken in much of South India today.
And the proponents of this theory
point to that small pocket of Dravidian-speaking people in the North,
actually near Afghanistan,
and they say that perhaps, sometime in the past,
Dravidian languages were spoken all over India
and that this suggests
that the Indus civilization is perhaps also Dravidian.
Which of these hypotheses can be true?
We don't know, but perhaps if you deciphered the script,
you would be able to answer this question.
But deciphering the script is a very challenging task.
First, there's no Rosetta Stone.
I don't mean the software;
I mean an ancient artifact
that contains in the same text
both a known text and an unknown text.
We don't have such an artifact for the Indus script.
And furthermore, we don't even know what language they spoke.
And to make matters even worse,
most of the text that we have are extremely short.
So as I showed you, they're usually found on these seals
that are very, very tiny.
And so given these formidable obstacles,
one might wonder and worry
whether one will ever be able to decipher the Indus script.
In the rest of my talk,
I'd like to tell you about how I learned to stop worrying
and love the challenge posed by the Indus script.
I've always been fascinated by the Indus script
ever since I read about it in a middle school textbook.
And why was I fascinated?
Well it's the last major undeciphered script in the ancient world.
My career path led me to become a computational neuroscientist,
so in my day job,
I create computer models of the brain
to try to understand how the brain makes predictions,
how the brain makes decisions,
how the brain learns and so on.
But in 2007, my path crossed again with the Indus script.
That's when I was in India,
and I had the wonderful opportunity
to meet with some Indian scientists
who were using computer models to try to analyze the script.
And so it was then that I realized
there was an opportunity for me to collaborate with these scientists,
and so I jumped at that opportunity.
And I'd like to describe some of the results that we have found.
Or better yet, let's all collectively decipher.
Are you ready?
The first thing that you need to do when you have an undeciphered script
is try to figure out the direction of writing.
Here are two texts that contain some symbols on them.
Can you tell me
if the direction of writing is right to left or left to right?
I'll give you a couple of seconds.
Okay. Right to left, how many? Okay.
Okay. Left to right?
Oh, it's almost 50/50. Okay.
The answer is:
if you look at the left-hand side of the two texts,
you'll notice that there's a cramping of signs,
and it seems like 4,000 years ago,
when the scribe was writing from right to left,
they ran out of space.
And so they had to cram the sign.
One of the signs is also below the text on the top.
This suggests the direction of writing
was probably from right to left,
and so that's one of the first things we know,
that directionality is a very key aspect of linguistic scripts.
And the Indus script now has
this particular property.
What other properties of language does the script show?
Languages contain patterns.
If I give you the letter Q
and ask you to predict the next letter, what do you think that would be?
Most of you said U, which is right.
Now if I asked you to predict one more letter,
what do you think that would be?
Now there's several thoughts. There's E. It could be I. It could be A,
but certainly not B, C or D, right?
The Indus script also exhibits similar kinds of patterns.
There's a lot of text that start with this diamond-shaped symbol.
And this in turn tends to be followed
by this quotation marks-like symbol.
And this is very similar to a Q and U example.
This symbol can in turn be followed
by these fish-like symbols and some other signs,
but never by these other signs at the bottom.
And furthermore, there's some signs
that really prefer the end of texts,
such as this jar-shaped sign,
and this sign, in fact, happens to be
the most frequently occurring sign in the script.
Given such patterns, here was our idea.
The idea was to use a computer
to learn these patterns,
and so we gave the computer the existing texts.
And the computer learned a statistical model
of which symbols tend to occur together
and which symbols tend to follow each other.
Given the computer model,
we can test the model by essentially quizzing it.
So we could deliberately erase some symbols,
and we can ask it to predict the missing symbols.
Here are some examples.
You may regard this
as perhaps the most ancient game
of Wheel of Fortune.
What we found
was that the computer was successful in 75 percent of the cases
in predicting the correct symbol.
In the rest of the cases,
typically the second best guess or third best guess was the right answer.
There's also practical use
for this particular procedure.
There's a lot of these texts that are damaged.
Here's an example of one such text.
And we can use the computer model now to try to complete this text
and make a best guess prediction.
Here's an example of a symbol that was predicted.
And this could be really useful as we try to decipher the script
by generating more data that we can analyze.
Now here's one other thing you can do with the computer model.
So imagine a monkey
sitting at a keyboard.
I think you might get a random jumble of letters that looks like this.
Such a random jumble of letters
is said to have a very high entropy.
This is a physics and information theory term.
But just imagine it's a really random jumble of letters.
How many of you have ever spilled coffee on a keyboard?
You might have encountered the stuck-key problem --
so basically the same symbol being repeated over and over again.
This kind of a sequence is said to have a very low entropy
because there's no variation at all.
Language, on the other hand, has an intermediate level of entropy;
it's neither too rigid,
nor is it too random.
What about the Indus script?
Here's a graph that plots the entropies of a whole bunch of sequences.
At the very top you find the uniformly random sequence,
which is a random jumble of letters --
and interestingly, we also find
the DNA sequence from the human genome and instrumental music.
And both of these are very, very flexible,
which is why you find them in the very high range.
At the lower end of the scale,
you find a rigid sequence, a sequence of all A's,
and you also find a computer program,
in this case in the language Fortran,
which obeys really strict rules.
Linguistic scripts
occupy the middle range.
Now what about the Indus script?
We found that the Indus script
actually falls within the range of the linguistic scripts.
When this result was first published,
it was highly controversial.
There were people who raised a hue and cry,
and these people were the ones who believed
that the Indus script does not represent language.
I even started to get some hate mail.
My students said
that I should really seriously consider getting some protection.
Who'd have thought
that deciphering could be a dangerous profession?
What does this result really show?
It shows that the Indus script
shares an important property of language.
So, as the old saying goes,
if it looks like a linguistic script
and it acts like a linguistic script,
then perhaps we may have a linguistic script on our hands.
What other evidence is there
that the script could actually encode language?
Well linguistic scripts can actually encode multiple languages.
So for example, here's the same sentence written in English
and the same sentence written in Dutch
using the same letters of the alphabet.
If you don't know Dutch and you only know English
and I give you some words in Dutch,
you'll tell me that these words contain
some very unusual patterns.
Some things are not right,
and you'll say these words are probably not English words.
The same thing happens in the case of the Indus script.
The computer found several texts --
two of them are shown here --
that have very unusual patterns.
So for example the first text:
there's a doubling of this jar-shaped sign.
This sign is the most frequently-occurring sign
in the Indus script,
and it's only in this text
that it occurs as a doubling pair.
Why is that the case?
We went back and looked at where these particular texts were found,
and it turns out that they were found
very, very far away from the Indus Valley.
They were found in present day Iraq and Iran.
And why were they found there?
What I haven't told you is that
the Indus people were very, very enterprising.
They used to trade with people pretty far away from where they lived,
and so in this case, they were traveling by sea
all the way to Mesopotamia, present-day Iraq.
And what seems to have happened here
is that the Indus traders, the merchants,
were using this script to write a foreign language.
It's just like our English and Dutch example.
And that would explain why we have these strange patterns
that are very different from the kinds of patterns you see in the text
that are found within the Indus Valley.
This suggests that the same script, the Indus script,
could be used to write different languages.
The results we have so far seem to point to the conclusion
that the Indus script probably does represent language.
If it does represent language,
then how do we read the symbols?
That's our next big challenge.
So you'll notice that many of the symbols
look like pictures of humans, of insects,
of fishes, of birds.
Most ancient scripts
use the rebus principle,
which is, using pictures to represent words.
So as an example, here's a word.
Can you write it using pictures?
I'll give you a couple seconds.
Got it?
Okay. Great.
Here's my solution.
You could use the picture of a bee followed by a picture of a leaf --
and that's "belief," right.
There could be other solutions.
In the case of the Indus script,
the problem is the reverse.
You have to figure out the sounds of each of these pictures
such that the entire sequence makes sense.
So this is just like a crossword puzzle,
except that this is the mother of all crossword puzzles
because the stakes are so high if you solve it.
My colleagues, Iravatham Mahadevan and Asko Parpola,
have been making some headway on this particular problem.
And I'd like to give you a quick example of Parpola's work.
Here's a really short text.
It contains seven vertical strokes followed by this fish-like sign.
And I want to mention that these seals were used
for stamping clay tags
that were attached to bundles of goods,
so it's quite likely that these tags, at least some of them,
contain names of merchants.
And it turns out that in India
there's a long tradition
of names being based on horoscopes
and star constellations present at the time of birth.
In Dravidian languages,
the word for fish is "meen"
which happens to sound just like the word for star.
And so seven stars
would stand for "elu meen,"
which is the Dravidian word
for the Big Dipper star constellation.
Similarly, there's another sequence of six stars,
and that translates to "aru meen,"
which is the old Dravidian name
for the star constellation Pleiades.
And finally, there's other combinations,
such as this fish sign with something that looks like a roof on top of it.
And that could be translated into "mey meen,"
which is the old Dravidian name for the planet Saturn.
So that was pretty exciting.
It looks like we're getting somewhere.
But does this prove
that these seals contain Dravidian names
based on planets and star constellations?
Well not yet.
So we have no way of validating
these particular readings,
but if more and more of these readings start making sense,
and if longer and longer sequences
appear to be correct,
then we know that we are on the right track.
Today,
we can write a word such as TED
in Egyptian hieroglyphics and in cuneiform script,
because both of these were deciphered
in the 19th century.
The decipherment of these two scripts
enabled these civilizations to speak to us again directly.
The Mayans
started speaking to us in the 20th century,
but the Indus civilization remains silent.
Why should we care?
The Indus civilization does not belong
to just the South Indians or the North Indians
or the Pakistanis;
it belongs to all of us.
These are our ancestors --
yours and mine.
They were silenced
by an unfortunate accident of history.
If we decipher the script,
we would enable them to speak to us again.
What would they tell us?
What would we find out about them? About us?
I can't wait to find out.
Thank you.

Chris Anderson: Jill Sobule!
Good morning.
I'm here today to talk
about autonomous flying beach balls.
(Laughter)
No, agile aerial robots like this one.
I'd like to tell you a little bit
about the challenges in building these,
and some of the terrific opportunities
for applying this technology.
So these robots are related
to unmanned aerial vehicles.
However, the vehicles
you see here are big.
They weigh thousands of pounds,
are not by any means agile.
They're not even autonomous.
In fact, many of these vehicles
are operated by flight crews
that can include multiple pilots,
operators of sensors,
and mission coordinators.
What we're interested in
is developing robots like this --
and here are two other pictures --
of robots that you can buy off the shelf.
So these are helicopters with four rotors,
and they're roughly
a meter or so in scale,
and weigh several pounds.
And so we retrofit these
with sensors and processors,
and these robots can fly indoors.
Without GPS.
The robot I'm holding in my hand
is this one,
and it's been created by two students,
Alex and Daniel.
So this weighs a little more
than a tenth of a pound.
It consumes about 15 watts of power.
And as you can see,
it's about eight inches in diameter.
So let me give you
just a very quick tutorial
on how these robots work.
So it has four rotors.
If you spin these rotors
at the same speed,
the robot hovers.
If you increase the speed
of each of these rotors,
then the robot flies up,
it accelerates up.
Of course, if the robot were tilted,
inclined to the horizontal,
then it would accelerate
in this direction.
So to get it to tilt,
there's one of two ways of doing it.
So in this picture, you see
that rotor four is spinning faster
and rotor two is spinning slower.
And when that happens,
there's a moment that causes
this robot to roll.
And the other way around,
if you increase the speed of rotor three
and decrease the speed of rotor one,
then the robot pitches forward.
And then finally,
if you spin opposite pairs of rotors
faster than the other pair,
then the robot yaws
about the vertical axis.
So an on-board processor
essentially looks at what motions
need to be executed
and combines these motions,
and figures out what commands
to send to the motors --
600 times a second.
That's basically how this thing operates.
So one of the advantages of this design
is when you scale things down,
the robot naturally becomes agile.
So here, R is the characteristic
length of the robot.
It's actually half the diameter.
And there are lots of physical parameters
that change as you reduce R.
The one that's most important
is the inertia,
or the resistance to motion.
So it turns out the inertia,
which governs angular motion,
scales as a fifth power of R.
So the smaller you make R,
the more dramatically the inertia reduces.
So as a result, the angular acceleration,
denoted by the Greek letter alpha here,
goes as 1 over R.
It's inversely proportional to R.
The smaller you make it,
the more quickly you can turn.
So this should be clear in these videos.
On the bottom right, you see a robot
performing a 360-degree flip
in less than half a second.
Multiple flips, a little more time.
So here the processes on board
are getting feedback from accelerometers
and gyros on board,
and calculating, like I said before,
commands at 600 times a second,
to stabilize this robot.
So on the left, you see Daniel
throwing this robot up into the air,
and it shows you
how robust the control is.
No matter how you throw it,
the robot recovers and comes back to him.
So why build robots like this?
Well, robots like this
have many applications.
You can send them
inside buildings like this,
as first responders to look for intruders,
maybe look for biochemical leaks,
gaseous leaks.
You can also use them
for applications like construction.
So here are robots carrying beams, columns
and assembling cube-like structures.
I'll tell you a little bit
more about this.
The robots can be used
for transporting cargo.
So one of the problems
with these small robots
is their payload-carrying capacity.
So you might want to have
multiple robots carry payloads.
This is a picture of a recent
experiment we did --
actually not so recent anymore --
in Sendai, shortly after the earthquake.
So robots like this could be sent
into collapsed buildings,
to assess the damage
after natural disasters,
or sent into reactor buildings,
to map radiation levels.
So one fundamental problem
that the robots have to solve
if they are to be autonomous,
is essentially figuring out how to get
from point A to point B.
So this gets a little challenging,
because the dynamics of this robot
are quite complicated.
In fact, they live
in a 12-dimensional space.
So we use a little trick.
We take this curved 12-dimensional space,
and transform it into a flat,
four-dimensional space.
And that four-dimensional space
consists of X, Y, Z,
and then the yaw angle.
And so what the robot does,
is it plans what we call
a minimum-snap trajectory.
So to remind you of physics:
You have position, derivative, velocity;
then acceleration;
and then comes jerk,
and then comes snap.
So this robot minimizes snap.
So what that effectively does,
is produce a smooth and graceful motion.
And it does that avoiding obstacles.
So these minimum-snap trajectories
in this flat space are then transformed
back into this complicated
12-dimensional space,
which the robot must do
for control and then execution.
So let me show you some examples
of what these minimum-snap
trajectories look like.
And in the first video,
you'll see the robot going
from point A to point B,
through an intermediate point.
(Whirring noise)
So the robot is obviously capable
of executing any curve trajectory.
So these are circular trajectories,
where the robot pulls about two G's.
Here you have overhead
motion capture cameras on the top
that tell the robot where it is
100 times a second.
It also tells the robot
where these obstacles are.
And the obstacles can be moving.
And here, you'll see Daniel
throw this hoop into the air,
while the robot is calculating
the position of the hoop,
and trying to figure out how to best
go through the hoop.
So as an academic,
we're always trained to be able
to jump through hoops
to raise funding for our labs,
and we get our robots to do that.
(Applause)
So another thing the robot can do
is it remembers pieces of trajectory
that it learns or is pre-programmed.
So here, you see the robot combining
a motion that builds up momentum,
and then changes its orientation
and then recovers.
So it has to do this
because this gap in the window
is only slightly larger
than the width of the robot.
So just like a diver
stands on a springboard
and then jumps off it to gain momentum,
and then does this pirouette,
this two and a half somersault through
and then gracefully recovers,
this robot is basically doing that.
So it knows how to combine
little bits and pieces of trajectories
to do these fairly difficult tasks.
So I want change gears.
So one of the disadvantages
of these small robots is its size.
And I told you earlier
that we may want to employ
lots and lots of robots
to overcome the limitations of size.
So one difficulty is:
How do you coordinate
lots of these robots?
And so here, we looked to nature.
So I want to show you a clip
of Aphaenogaster desert ants,
in Professor Stephen Pratt's lab,
carrying an object.
So this is actually a piece of fig.
Actually you take any object
coated with fig juice,
and the ants will carry it
back to the nest.
So these ants don't have
any central coordinator.
They sense their neighbors.
There's no explicit communication.
But because they sense the neighbors
and because they sense the object,
they have implicit coordination
across the group.
So this is the kind of coordination
we want our robots to have.
So when we have a robot
which is surrounded by neighbors --
and let's look at robot I and robot J --
what we want the robots to do,
is to monitor the separation between them,
as they fly in formation.
And then you want to make sure
that this separation
is within acceptable levels.
So again, the robots monitor this error
and calculate the control commands
100 times a second,
which then translates into motor commands,
600 times a second.
So this also has to be done
in a decentralized way.
Again, if you have
lots and lots of robots,
it's impossible to coordinate
all this information centrally
fast enough in order for the robots
to accomplish the task.
Plus, the robots have to base
their actions only on local information --
what they sense from their neighbors.
And then finally,
we insist that the robots be agnostic
to who their neighbors are.
So this is what we call anonymity.
So what I want to show you next
is a video of 20 of these little robots,
flying in formation.
They're monitoring
their neighbors' positions.
They're maintaining formation.
The formations can change.
They can be planar formations,
they can be three-dimensional formations.
As you can see here,
they collapse from a three-dimensional
formation into planar formation.
And to fly through obstacles,
they can adapt the formations on the fly.
So again, these robots come
really close together.
As you can see
in this figure-eight flight,
they come within inches of each other.
And despite the aerodynamic interactions
with these propeller blades,
they're able to maintain stable flight.
(Applause)
So once you know how to fly in formation,
you can actually pick up
objects cooperatively.
So this just shows that we can
double, triple, quadruple
the robots' strength,
by just getting them to team
with neighbors, as you can see here.
One of the disadvantages of doing that is,
as you scale things up --
so if you have lots of robots
carrying the same thing,
you're essentially increasing the inertia,
and therefore you pay a price;
they're not as agile.
But you do gain in terms
of payload-carrying capacity.
Another application I want to show you --
again, this is in our lab.
This is work done by Quentin Lindsey,
who's a graduate student.
So his algorithm essentially
tells these robots
how to autonomously build cubic structures
from truss-like elements.
So his algorithm tells the robot
what part to pick up,
when, and where to place it.
So in this video you see --
and it's sped up 10, 14 times --
you see three different structures
being built by these robots.
And again, everything is autonomous,
and all Quentin has to do
is to give them a blueprint
of the design that he wants to build.
So all these experiments
you've seen thus far,
all these demonstrations,
have been done with the help
of motion-capture systems.
So what happens when you leave your lab,
and you go outside into the real world?
And what if there's no GPS?
So this robot is actually
equipped with a camera,
and a laser rangefinder, laser scanner.
And it uses these sensors
to build a map of the environment.
What that map consists of are features --
like doorways, windows,
people, furniture --
and it then figures out
where its position is,
with respect to the features.
So there is no global coordinate system.
The coordinate system
is defined based on the robot,
where it is and what it's looking at.
And it navigates with respect
to those features.
So I want to show you a clip
of algorithms developed by Frank Shen
and Professor Nathan Michael,
that shows this robot entering
a building for the very first time,
and creating this map on the fly.
So the robot then figures out
what the features are,
it builds the map,
it figures out where it is
with respect to the features,
and then estimates its position
100 times a second,
allowing us to use the control algorithms
that I described to you earlier.
So this robot is actually being
commanded remotely by Frank,
but the robot can also figure out
where to go on its own.
So suppose I were to send
this into a building,
and I had no idea
what this building looked like.
I can ask this robot to go in,
create a map,
and then come back and tell me
what the building looks like.
So here, the robot is not
only solving the problem
of how to go from point A
to point B in this map,
but it's figuring out what the best
point B is at every time.
So essentially it knows where to go
to look for places that have
the least information,
and that's how it populates this map.
So I want to leave you
with one last application.
And there are many applications
of this technology.
I'm a professor, and we're
passionate about education.
Robots like this can really change
the way we do K-12 education.
But we're in Southern California,
close to Los Angeles,
so I have to conclude with something
focused on entertainment.
I want to conclude with a music video.
I want to introduce the creators,
Alex and Daniel, who created this video.
(Applause)
So before I play this video,
I want to tell you that they created it
in the last three days,
after getting a call from Chris.
And the robots that play in the video
are completely autonomous.
You will see nine robots
play six different instruments.
And of course, it's made
exclusively for TED 2012.
Let's watch.
(Sound of air escaping from valve)
(Music)
(Whirring sound)
(Music)
(Applause) (Cheers)
Now, I want to start with a question:
When was the last time
you were called "childish"?
For kids like me,
being called childish
can be a frequent occurrence.
Every time we make irrational demands,
exhibit irresponsible behavior,
or display any other signs
of being normal American citizens,
we are called childish.
Which really bothers me.
After all, take a look at these events:
Imperialism and colonization,
world wars, George W. Bush.
Ask yourself, who's responsible? Adults.
Now, what have kids done?
Well, Anne Frank touched millions
with her powerful account
of the Holocaust.
Ruby Bridges helped to end
segregation in the United States.
And, most recently,
Charlie Simpson helped to raise
120,000 pounds for Haiti,
on his little bike.
So as you can see evidenced
by such examples,
age has absolutely nothing to do with it.
The traits the word "childish" addresses
are seen so often in adults,
that we should abolish
this age-discriminatory word,
when it comes to criticizing behavior
associated with irresponsibility
and irrational thinking.
(Applause)
Thank you.
Then again, who's to say
that certain types of irrational thinking
aren't exactly what the world needs?
Maybe you've had grand plans before,
but stopped yourself, thinking,
"That's impossible,"
or "That costs too much,"
or "That won't benefit me."
For better or worse, we kids
aren't hampered as much
when it comes to thinking
about reasons why not to do things.
Kids can be full of inspiring
aspirations and hopeful thinking,
like my wish that no one went hungry,
or that everything were free,
a kind of utopia.
How many of you still dream like that,
and believe in the possibilities?
Sometimes a knowledge of history
and the past failures of Utopian ideals
can be a burden,
because you know
that if everything were free,
then the food stocks would become
depleted and scarce and lead to chaos.
On the other hand, we kids
still dream about perfection.
And that's a good thing, because
in order to make anything a reality,
you have to dream about it first.
In many ways, our audacity to imagine
helps push the boundaries of possibility.
For instance, the Museum
of Glass in Tacoma, Washington,
my home state -- yoohoo, Washington!
(Applause)
has a program called Kids Design Glass,
and kids draw their own
ideas for glass art.
The resident artist said
they got some of their best ideas
from the program, because kids
don't think about the limitations
of how hard it can be to blow
glass into certain shapes,
they just think of good ideas.
Now, when you think of glass, you
might think of colorful Chihuly designs,
or maybe Italian vases,
but kids challenge glass artists
to go beyond that,
into the realm of brokenhearted snakes
and bacon boys,
who you can see has meat vision.
(Laughter)
Now, our inherent wisdom doesn't
have to be insider's knowledge.
Kids already do a lot
of learning from adults,
and we have a lot to share.
I think that adults should
start learning from kids.
Now, I do most of my speaking
in front of an education crowd --
teachers and students,
and I like this analogy:
It shouldn't be a teacher
at the head of the class,
telling students, "Do this, do that."
The students should teach their teachers.
Learning between grown-ups
and kids should be reciprocal.
The reality, unfortunately,
is a little different,
and it has a lot to do
with trust, or a lack of it.
Now, if you don't trust someone,
you place restrictions on them, right?
If I doubt my older sister's ability
to pay back the 10 percent interest
I established on her last loan,
I'm going to withhold her ability
to get more money from me,
until she pays it back.
(Laughter)
True story, by the way.
Now, adults seem to have
a prevalently restrictive
attitude towards kids,
from every "Don't do that, don't do this"
in the school handbook,
to restrictions on school Internet use.
As history points out,
regimes become oppressive
when they're fearful
about keeping control.
And although adults
may not be quite at the level
of totalitarian regimes,
kids have no or very little say
in making the rules,
when really, the attitude
should be reciprocal,
meaning that the adult
population should learn
and take into account the wishes
of the younger population.
Now, what's even worse than restriction,
is that adults often
underestimate kids' abilities.
We love challenges, but when
expectations are low,
trust me, we will sink to them.
My own parents had anything
but low expectations
for me and my sister.
Okay, so they didn't tell us to become
doctors or lawyers or anything like that,
but my dad did read to us about Aristotle
and pioneer germ-fighters,
when lots of other kids were hearing
"The Wheels on the Bus
Go Round and Round."
Well, we heard that one too, but
"Pioneer Germ Fighters" totally rules.
(Laughter)
I loved to write from the age
of four, and when I was six,
my mom bought me my own laptop
equipped with Microsoft Word.
Thank you, Bill Gates, and thank you, Ma.
I wrote over 300 short stories
on that little laptop,
and I wanted to get published.
Instead of just scoffing at this heresy
that a kid wanted to get published,
or saying wait until you're older,
my parents were really supportive.
Many publishers were not
quite so encouraging.
One large children's
publisher ironically said
that they didn't work with children.
Children's publisher not
working with children?
I don't know, you're kind
of alienating a large client there.
(Laughter)
One publisher, Action Publishing, was
willing to take that leap and trust me,
and to listen to what I had to say.
They published my first book,
"Flying Fingers," you see it here.
And from there on, it's gone
to speaking at hundreds of schools,
keynoting to thousands of educators,
and finally, today, speaking to you.
I appreciate your attention today,
because to show that you
truly care, you listen.
But there's a problem
with this rosy picture
of kids being so much better than adults.
Kids grow up and become
adults just like you.
(Laughter)
Or just like you? Really?
The goal is not to turn kids
into your kind of adult,
but rather, better adults
than you have been,
which may be a little challenging,
considering your guys' credentials.
(Laughter)
But the way progress happens,
is because new generations and new eras
grow and develop and become
better than the previous ones.
It's the reason we're not
in the Dark Ages anymore.
No matter your position or place in life,
it is imperative to create
opportunities for children,
so that we can grow up to blow you away.
(Laughter)
Adults and fellow TEDsters,
you need to listen and learn from kids,
and trust us and expect more from us.
You must lend an ear today,
because we are the leaders
of tomorrow, which means
we're going to take care of you
when you're old and senile.
No, just kidding.
(Laughter)
No, really, we are going
to be the next generation,
the ones who will bring
this world forward.
And in case you don't think
that this really has meaning for you,
remember that cloning is possible,
and that involves going
through childhood again,
in which case you'll want to be
heard, just like my generation.
Now, the world needs opportunities
for new leaders and new ideas.
Kids need opportunities
to lead and succeed.
Are you ready to make the match?
Because the world's problems
shouldn't be the human family's heirloom.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Thank you. Thank you.
So for the past year and a half,
my team at Push Pop Press
and Charlie Melcher and Melcher Media
have been working on creating
the first feature-length interactive book.
It's called "Our Choice"
and the author is Al Gore.
It's the sequel to "An Inconvenient Truth,"
and it explores all the solutions
that will solve the climate crisis.
The book starts like this. This is the cover.
As the globe spins,
we can see our location,
and we can open the book
and swipe through the chapters
to browse the book.
Or, we can scroll through the pages at the bottom.
And if we wanted to zoom into a page,
we can just open it up.
And anything you see in the book,
you can pick up with two fingers
and lift off the page
and open up.
And if you want to go back
and read the book again,
you just fold it back up and put it back on the page.
And so this works the same way; you pick it up and pop it open.
(Audio) Al Gore: I consider myself
among the majority
who look at windmills and feel
they're a beautiful addition to the landscape.
Mike Matas: And so throughout the whole book,
Al Gore will walk you through and explain the photos.
This photo, you can you can even see on an interactive map.
Zoom into it and see where it was taken.
And throughout the book,
there's over an hour of documentary footage
and interactive animations.
So you can open this one.
(Audio) AG: Most modern wind turbines consist of a large ...
MM: It starts playing immediately.
And while it's playing, we can pinch and peak back at the page,
and the movie keeps playing.
Or we can zoom out to the table of contents,
and the video keeps playing.
But one of the coolest things in this book
are the interactive infographics.
This one shows the wind potential
all around the United States.
But instead of just showing us the information,
we can take our finger and explore,
and see, state by state,
exactly how much wind potential there is.
We can do the same for geothermal energy
and solar power.
This is one of my favorites.
So this shows ...
(Laughter)
(Applause)
When the wind is blowing,
any excess energy coming from the windmill
is diverted into the battery.
And as the wind starts dying down,
any excess energy will be diverted back into the house --
the lights never go out.
And this whole book, it doesn't just run on the iPad.
It also runs on the iPhone.
And so you can start reading on your iPad in your living room
and then pick up where you left off on the iPhone.
And it works the exact same way.
You can pinch into any page.
Open it up.
So that's Push Pop Press' first title,
Al Gore's "Our Choice."
Thank you.
(Applause)
Chris Anderson: That's spectacular.
Do you want to be a publisher,
a technology licenser?
What is the business here?
Is this something that other people can do?
MM: Yeah, we're building a tool
that makes it really easy for publishers right now to build this content.
So Melcher Media's team, who's on the East coast --
and we're on the West coast, building the software --
takes our tool
and, every day, drags in images and text.
CA: So you want to license this software to publishers
to make books as beautiful as that? (MM: Yes.)
All right. Mike, thanks so much.
MM: Thank you. (CA: Good luck.)
(Applause)
A few years ago,
I felt like I was stuck in a rut,
so I decided to follow in the footsteps
of the great American
philosopher, Morgan Spurlock,
and try something new for 30 days.
The idea is actually pretty simple.
Think about something you've always
wanted to add to your life
and try it for the next 30 days.
It turns out 30 days is just
about the right amount of time
to add a new habit or subtract a habit --
like watching the news --
from your life.
There's a few things I learned
while doing these 30-day challenges.
The first was,
instead of the months
flying by, forgotten,
the time was much more memorable.
This was part of a challenge I did
to take a picture every day for a month.
And I remember exactly where I was
and what I was doing that day.
I also noticed
that as I started to do more
and harder 30-day challenges,
my self-confidence grew.
I went from desk-dwelling computer nerd
to the kind of guy who bikes to work.
For fun!
(Laughter)
Even last year, I ended up hiking
up Mt. Kilimanjaro,
the highest mountain in Africa.
I would never have been that adventurous
before I started my 30-day challenges.
I also figured out that if you
really want something badly enough,
you can do anything for 30 days.
Have you ever wanted to write a novel?
Every November,
tens of thousands of people
try to write their own
50,000-word novel, from scratch,
in 30 days.
It turns out, all you have to do
is write 1,667 words a day
for a month.
So I did.
By the way, the secret
is not to go to sleep
until you've written
your words for the day.
You might be sleep-deprived,
but you'll finish your novel.
Now is my book the next great
American novel?
No. I wrote it in a month.
It's awful.
(Laughter)
But for the rest of my life,
if I meet John Hodgman at a TED party,
I don't have to say,
"I'm a computer scientist."
No, no, if I want to,
I can say, "I'm a novelist."
(Laughter)
So here's one last thing
I'd like to mention.
I learned that when I made
small, sustainable changes,
things I could keep doing,
they were more likely to stick.
There's nothing wrong
with big, crazy challenges.
In fact, they're a ton of fun.
But they're less likely to stick.
When I gave up sugar for 30 days,
day 31 looked like this.
(Laughter)
So here's my question to you:
What are you waiting for?
I guarantee you the next 30 days
are going to pass
whether you like it or not,
so why not think about something
you have always wanted to try
and give it a shot!
For the next 30 days.
Thanks.
(Applause)
Two years ago here at TED
I reported that we had discovered
at Saturn, with the Cassini Spacecraft,
an anomalously warm and geologically active region
at the southern tip of the small Saturnine moon
Enceladus, seen here.
This region seen here for the first time
in the Cassini image taken in 2005. This is the south polar region,
with the famous tiger-stripe fractures crossing the south pole.
And seen just recently in late 2008,
here is that region again,
now half in darkness because the southern hemisphere
is experiencing the onset of August
and eventually winter.
And I also reported that we'd made this mind-blowing discovery --
this once-in-a-lifetime discovery
of towering jets
erupting from those fractures at the south pole,
consisting of tiny water ice crystals
accompanied by water vapor
and simple organic compounds like carbon dioxide and methane.
And at that time two years ago
I mentioned that we were speculating
that these jets might in fact be geysers,
and erupting from pockets
or chambers of liquid water underneath the surface,
but we weren't really sure.
However, the implications of those results --
of a possible environment within this moon
that could support prebiotic chemistry,
and perhaps life itself --
were so exciting that, in the intervening two years,
we have focused more on Enceladus.
We've flown the Cassini Spacecraft
by this moon now several times,
flying closer and deeper into these jets,
into the denser regions of these jets,
so that now we have come away with some
very precise compositional measurements.
And we have found
that the organic compounds coming from this moon
are in fact more complex than we previously reported.
While they're not amino acids,
we're now finding things like
propane and benzene,
hydrogen cyanide, and formaldehyde.
And the tiny water crystals here
now look for all the world
like they are frozen droplets of salty water,
which is a discovery that suggests
that not only do the jets come from
pockets of liquid water,
but that that liquid water is in contact with rock.
And that is a circumstance
that could supply the chemical energy
and the chemical compounds needed to sustain life.
So we are very encouraged by these results.
And we are much more confident now than we were two years ago
that we might indeed
have on this moon, under the south pole,
an environment or a zone that is hospitable to living organisms.
Whether or not there are living organisms there, of course,
is an entirely different matter.
And that will have to await the arrival,
back at Enceladus,
of the spacecrafts, hopefully some time in the near future,
specifically equipped to address that particular question.
But in the meantime I invite you to imagine the day
when we might journey to the Saturnine system,
and visit the Enceladus interplanetary geyser park,
just because we can.
Thank you.
(Applause)
So imagine that a plane is about to crash
with 250 children and babies,
and if you knew how to stop that, would you?
Now imagine
that 60 planes full of babies under five
crash every single day.
That's the number of kids
that never make it to their fifth birthday.
6.6 million children
never make it to their fifth birthday.
Most of these deaths are preventable,
and that doesn't just make me sad,
it makes me angry,
and it makes me determined.
Diarrhea and pneumonia
are among the top two killers
of children under five,
and what we can do to prevent these diseases
isn't some smart,
new technological innovations.
It's one of the world's oldest inventions:
a bar of soap.
Washing hands with soap,
a habit we all take for granted,
can reduce diarrhea by half,
can reduce respiratory infections by one third.
Handwashing with soap
can have an impact
on reducing flu, trachoma, SARS,
and most recently in the case of cholera
and Ebola outbreak,
one of the key interventions
is handwashing with soap.
Handwashing with soap keeps kids in school.
It stops babies from dying.
Handwashing with soap
is one of the most cost-effective
ways of saving children's lives.
It can save over 600,000 children every year.
That's the equivalent of stopping
10 jumbo jets
full of babies and children
from crashing every single day.
I think you'll agree with me that that's a pretty
useful public health intervention.
So now just take a minute.
I think you need to get to
know the person next to you.
Why don't you just shake their hands.
Please shake their hands.
All right, get to know each other.
They look really pretty.
All right.
So what if I told you
that the person whose hands you just shook
actually didn't wash their hands
when they were coming out of the toilet?
(Laughter)
They don't look so pretty anymore, right?
Pretty yucky, you would agree with me.
Well, statistics are actually showing
that four people out of five
don't wash their hands when
they come out of the toilet,
globally.
And the same way,
we don't do it when we've got fancy toilets,
running water, and soap available,
it's the same thing in the countries
where child mortality is really high.
What is it? Is there no soap?
Actually, soap is available.
In 90 percent of households in India,
94 percent of households in Kenya,
you will find soap.
Even in countries where soap is the lowest,
like Ethiopia, we are at 50 percent.
So why is it?
Why aren't people washing their hands?
Why is it that Mayank,
this young boy that I met in India,
isn't washing his hands?
Well, in Mayank's family,
soap is used for bathing,
soap is used for laundry,
soap is used for washing dishes.
His parents think sometimes
it's a precious commodity,
so they'll keep it in a cupboard.
They'll keep it away from him so he doesn't waste it.
On average, in Mayank's family,
they will use soap for washing hands
once a day
at the very best, and sometimes
even once a week for washing hands with soap.
What's the result of that?
Children pick up disease
in the place that's supposed to love them
and protect them the most, in their homes.
Think about where you learned to wash your hands.
Did you learn to wash your hands at home?
Did you learn to wash your hands in school?
I think behavioral scientists will tell you
that it's very difficult to change the habits
that you have had early in life.
However, we all copy what everyone else does,
and local cultural norms are something
that shape how we change our behavior,
and this is where the private sector comes in.
Every second in Asia and Africa,
111 mothers
will buy this bar to protect their family.
Many women in India will tell you
they learned all about hygiene, diseases,
from this bar of soap from Lifebuoy brand.
Iconic brands like this one
have a responsibility to do good
in the places where they sell their products.
It's that belief, plus the scale of Unilever,
that allows us to keep talking about
handwashing with soap and
hygiene to these mothers.
Big businesses and brands can change
and shift those social norms
and make a difference for those habits
that are so stubborn.
Think about it:
Marketeers spend all their time
making us switch from one brand to the other.
And actually, they know how to transform
science and facts into compelling messages.
Just for a minute, imagine
when they put all their forces behind
a message as powerful as handwashing with soap.
The profit motive is transforming health outcomes
in this world.
But it's been happening for centuries:
the Lifebuoy brand was launched in 1894
in Victorian England
to actually combat cholera.
Last week, I was in Ghana
with the minister of health,
because if you don't know,
there's a cholera outbreak in Ghana at the moment.
A hundred and eighteen years later,
the solution is exactly the same:
It's about ensuring that they have access
to this bar of soap,
and that they're using it,
because that's the number one way
to actually stop cholera from spreading.
I think this drive for profit
is extremely powerful,
sometimes more powerful than
the most committed charity or government.
Government is doing what they can,
especially in terms of the pandemics
and epidemics such as cholera,
or Ebola at the moment,
but with competing priorities.
The budget is not always there.
And when you think about this,
you think about what is required
to make handwashing a daily habit,
it requires sustained funding
to refine this behavior.
In short, those that fight for public health
are actually dependent upon the soap companies
to keep promoting handwashing with soap.
We have friends like USAID,
the Global Public-Private Partnership
for Handwashing with Soap,
London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine,
Plan, WaterAid,
that all believe
for a win-win-win partnership.
Win for the public sector,
because we help them reach their targets.
Win for the private sector,
because we build new generations
of future handwashers.
And most importantly,
win for the most vulnerable.
On October 15,
we will celebrate Global Handwashing Day.
Schools, communities,
our friends in the public sector
and our friends in the private sector —
yes, on that day even our competitors,
we all join hands to celebrate
the world's most important
public health intervention.
What's required,
and again where the private sector
can make a huge difference,
is coming up with this big, creative thinking
that drives advocacy.
If you take our Help a Child Reach 5 campaign,
we've created great films
that bring the message of handwashing with soap
to the everyday person
in a way that can relate to them.
We've had over 30 million views.
Most of these discussions are still happening online.
I urge you to take five minutes
and look at those films.
I come from Mali,
one of the world's poorest countries.
I grew up in a family where every dinner conversation
was around social justice.
I trained in Europe's premier school of public health.
I think I'm probably one of the only women
in my country with this high degree in health,
and the only one
with a doctorate in handwashing with soap.
(Laughter)
(Applause)
Nine years ago, I decided,
with a successful public health career in the making,
that I could make the biggest impact coming,
selling and promoting the world's best invention
in public health: soap.
We run today the world's largest
handwashing program
by any public health standards.
We've reached over 183 million people
in 16 countries.
My team and I have the ambition
to reach one billion by 2020.
Over the last four years,
business has grown double digits,
whilst child mortality has reduced
in all the places where soap use has increased.
It may be uncomfortable for some to hear —
business growth and lives saved
somehow equated in the same sentence —
but it is that business growth
that allows us to keep doing more.
Without it, and without talking about it,
we cannot achieve the change that we need.
Last week, my team and I
spent time visiting mothers
that have all experienced the same thing:
the death of a newborn.
I'm a mom. I can't imagine anything more powerful
and more painful.
This one is from Myanmar.
She had the most beautiful smile,
the smile, I think, that life gives you
when you've had a second chance.
Her son, Myo, is her second one.
She had a daughter
who passed away at three weeks,
and we know that the majority
of children that actually die
die in the first month of their life,
and we know that if we give a bar of soap
to every skilled birth attendant,
and that if soap is used 
before touching the babies,
we can reduce and make a change
in terms of those numbers.
And that's what inspires me,
inspires me to continue in this mission,
to know that I can equip her
with what's needed
so that she can do
the most beautiful job in the world:
nurturing her newborn.
And next time you think of a gift
for a new mom and her family,
don't look far: buy her soap.
It's the most beautiful invention in public health.
I hope you will join us
and make handwashing part of your daily lives
and our daily lives
and help more children like Myo
reach their fifth birthday.
Thank you.
(Applause)
I am in search of another planet
in the universe where life exists.
I can't see this planet
with my naked eyes
or even with the most powerful telescopes
we currently possess.
But I know that it's there.
And understanding contradictions
that occur in nature
will help us find it.
On our planet,
where there's water, there's life.
So we look for planets that orbit
at just the right distance
from their stars.
At this distance,
shown in blue on this diagram
for stars of different temperatures,
planets could be warm enough
for water to flow on their surfaces
as lakes and oceans
where life might reside.
Some astronomers focus their time
and energy on finding planets
at these distances from their stars.
What I do picks up where their job ends.
I model the possible
climates of exoplanets.
And here's why that's important:
there are many factors
besides distance from its star
that control whether
a planet can support life.
Take the planet Venus.
It's named after the Roman goddess
of love and beauty,
because of its benign,
ethereal appearance in the sky.
But spacecraft measurements
revealed a different story.
The surface temperature is close
to 900 degrees Fahrenheit,
500 Celsius.
That's hot enough to melt lead.
Its thick atmosphere, not its distance
from the sun, is the reason.
It causes a greenhouse effect on steroids,
trapping heat from the sun
and scorching the planet's surface.
The reality totally contradicted
initial perceptions of this planet.
From these lessons
from our own solar system,
we've learned that a planet's atmosphere
is crucial to its climate
and potential to host life.
We don't know what the atmospheres
of these planets are like
because the planets are so small
and dim compared to their stars
and so far away from us.
For example, one of the closest planets
that could support surface water --
it's called Gliese 667 Cc --
such a glamorous name, right,
nice phone number for a name --
it's 23 light years away.
So that's more than 100 trillion miles.
Trying to measure
the atmospheric composition
of an exoplanet passing
in front of its host star is hard.
It's like trying to see a fruit fly
passing in front of a car's headlight.
OK, now imagine that car
is 100 trillion miles away,
and you want to know
the precise color of that fly.
So I use computer models
to calculate the kind of atmosphere
a planet would need
to have a suitable climate
for water and life.
Here's an artist's concept
of the planet Kepler-62f,
with the Earth for reference.
It's 1,200 light years away,
and just 40 percent larger than Earth.
Our NSF-funded work found that it
could be warm enough for open water
from many types of atmospheres
and orientations of its orbit.
So I'd like future telescopes
to follow up on this planet
to look for signs of life.
Ice on a planet's surface
is also important for climate.
Ice absorbs longer,
redder wavelengths of light,
and reflects shorter, bluer light.
That's why the iceberg
in this photo looks so blue.
The redder light from the sun
is absorbed on its way through the ice.
Only the blue light
makes it all the way to the bottom.
Then it gets reflected
back to up to our eyes
and we see blue ice.
My models show that planets
orbiting cooler stars
could actually be warmer
than planets orbiting hotter stars.
There's another contradiction --
that ice absorbs the longer
wavelength light from cooler stars,
and that light, that energy,
heats the ice.
Using climate models to explore
how these contradictions
can affect planetary climate
is vital to the search for life elsewhere.
And it's no surprise
that this is my specialty.
I'm an African-American female astronomer
and a classically trained actor
who loves to wear makeup
and read fashion magazines,
so I am uniquely positioned to appreciate
contradictions in nature --
(Laughter)
(Applause)
... and how they can inform our search
for the next planet where life exists.
My organization, Rising Stargirls,
teaches astronomy
to middle-school girls of color,
using theater, writing and visual art.
That's another contradiction --
science and art don't often go together,
but interweaving them can help
these girls bring their whole selves
to what they learn,
and maybe one day join
the ranks of astronomers
who are full of contradictions,
and use their backgrounds
to discover, once and for all,
that we are truly not alone
in the universe.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Shah Rukh Khan: The speaker
you are about to meet is
someone who knows and understands
the value of words like no one else does.
In his writing career
spanning over four decades,
this man has chosen words
with beauty and versatility,
like a flower springing to life ...
like Mr. Bachchan’s memorable punches ...
(Laughter)
like a best-selling book of Urdu poetry ...
like well ... what do I say,
only Javed Akhtar Sahab.
(Applause)
Please welcome onstage,
the one and only Javed Akhtar Sahab.
(Cheers and applause)
Javed Akhtar: Friends, this topic --
the power of words --
is an interesting one,
and one that's very close to my heart.
It’s strange
how we often overlook things
that are so close to us, near us.
How many people question,
"Why is air transparent?"
Or, "Why is water wet?"
How many think about
what is it that has passed?
Time has passed. What came?
What went away?
How many of us wonder?
Similarly ...
the words that we speak and hear all day,
how many times have we really thought,
"What exactly are these words?"
Words are a strange thing.
You once saw
an animal and decided it’s a "cat."
But cat is a sound.
This cat has nothing
to do with the animal.
But I have decided it’s a cat.
So a cat it is.
So I gave the sound
the identity of this animal.
After that I made a semicircle,
a pyramid, cut into half,
then a straight line,
then another below it, and wrote: "cat."
In these criss-crossed lines,
I filled a sound
and into that sound, a meaning.
Now like with this cat,
even with love, anger, a thought,
an idea, pain, suffering,
happiness, surprise,
everything has been linked with a sound.
And then sounds were fit
into some criss-crossed lines
that we call a script.
So three things that had nothing in common
were joined by us to create a word.
A sound that is actually gibberish
has been added onto it.
And the lines, crooked lines,
they formed a word.
Incredible!
And I have come to believe that with time,
these words have become like human beings.
A man is known by the company he keeps.
Similarly, with words,
what is the company it has been keeping?
What are the other words
being used with it?
For an average noun
or an average verb, an average mind
can quickly create reference.
Where did they hear it? See it?
What does it remind them of?
What is its connection?
When was it last used in conversation?
What has been my experience with it?
A host of memories appear
when you hear a word you remember.
And a good writer or orator is one
who knows that when
he uses a certain word,
an average mind will associate it
with a certain reference,
specific memories will be evoked.
Then he can create a world around a word.
What is the power of a word?
Be it a mother’s lullaby,
a politician’s speech,
love letters from your beloved,
or a complaint against someone,
a protest call ...
anger, sadness, happiness,
surprise, belonging, alienation
anything in the world,
any feeling in the world,
any emotion, any reaction,
until it is expressed in a word,
it will not have any meaning for you,
forget getting across to anyone else.
Words are not thoughts,
just like bricks are not homes.
But houses are made with bricks.
If you have less bricks,
you will make a small house.
The more words you have,
the clearer your thoughts,
and the more clearly you can convey them.
Nowadays I often hear,
especially from young ones,
“You know what I mean?"
No, I don't know what you mean.
(Laughter)
“You know what I mean,”
is running out of words.
Everything is now moving fast
so communication has to be fast as well.
But the tragedy is
that we have attained this speed
at the cost of depth of words.
We want to speak faster,
so everything is faster,
so the language is also faster,
hence communication is faster.
But this speed has affected depth.
Which means that forget
about other people,
just look at yourself.
You are not being able
to articulate your own feelings,
thoughts or emotions
in a detailed manner or clearly.
And these words, as long as words exist,
they aren’t there just for a meaning.
They are also a conveyer belt
of language, words.
They reflect your culture,
your traditions, your inheritance,
your cultural wealth accumulated
over generations, all of that
is carried forward with words.
If you cut a man off from some words,
you cut him off from a culture, a history.
This is exactly what is happening
with us today.
So language is a very powerful thing.
Words are extremely powerful.
But by themselves,
they are neither good nor bad.
If we start loving words
and understand their power,
we would realize
that everything that happens
in the world is because of words.
Or there would be nothing
between us and the rest of the creatures,
the rest of the animals,
although we too are animals.
The only difference is that
we can pass on, through our words,
our experience, our learning
and our knowledge to the next generation.
So we don’t only live on instinct
but our slowly accumulated experience
and knowledge over generations
is passed on to the next.
Through what? Through words.
And if we didn’t have these words
our advantage is gradually over
other species would diminish over time.
We advanced only because we have language.
And if we didn’t have that
we wouldn’t be here.
We would be right where we started.
So what does language mean?
Words!
So learn to respect words.
Love them.
Befriend them.
Listen to them attentively.
And speak attentively.
Thank you!
(Applause)
SRK: Thanks a lot, Javed Sahab,
for coming here today
and sharing such wonderful things with us.
I have known Javed Sahab since
I came to Mumbai about 25 years ago.
JA: I was really young then.
(Laughter)
SRK: Yes. You are still very young, Sir.
But I have got a lot of my education,
my ideologies and many more
things from Javed Sahab.
I’ll share a small incident.
He got angry with us
while working on a film.
He sometimes gets angry
when unlettered people
like us give him suggestions
that maybe we could use
this word or that instead.
So our film was called
"Kuch Kuch Hota Hai."
(Cheers)
And he did not like the title at all.
So once when he was really mad at us kids,
who are like his kids even now,
he retorted:
"Now my heart remains
neither awake nor rests.
What do I do? 
Oh! I feel something strange.
Is that what you want?"
In fact the entire song, all the words,
were thrown at us by Javed Sahab in anger.
And that song went on to become
extremely popular.
So even when Javed Sahab
throws out words in anger,
they turn into golden words.
That’s his gift.
(Cheers)
JA: Well, the incident that
Shah Rukh Sahab shared is indeed true.
So on hearing this title,
"'Kuch Kuch Hota Hai,"
I was shocked.
I felt it wasn’t dignified enough.
(Laughter)
Though to be honest,
I regret leaving such
a super hit film over its title.
So I left the film.
Later I also felt a little embarrassed,
and he too felt bad.
So we decided to let bygones be
bygones and work on some other film.
Hence, the film
"Kal Ho Naa Ho."
I told him that everything
else is still fine
but I owe you two kuchs.
Two kuchs.
(Laughter)
So I’ll write a song
and return these two to you.
I wrote a song specially
for this reason called
"Kuch to hua hai, kuch ho gaya hai."
(Cheers and applause)
and he returned his two.
(Applause)
Ladies and gentlemen, big
round of applause for Javed Akhtar Sahab.
(Applause)
Good morning.
I've come here to share with you an experiment
of how to get rid of one form of human suffering.
It really is a story of Dr. Venkataswamy.
His mission and his message is about the Aravind Eye Care System.
I think first it's important for us to recognize what it is to be blind.
(Music)
Woman: Everywhere I went looking for work, they said no,
what use do we have for a blind woman?
I couldn't thread a needle or see the lice in my hair.
If an ant fell into my rice, I couldn't see that either.
Thulasiraj Ravilla: Becoming blind is a big part of it,
but I think it also deprives the person of their livelihood, their dignity,
their independence, and their status in the family.
So she is just one amongst the millions who are blind.
And the irony is that they don't need to be.
A simple, well-proven surgery can restore sight to millions,
and something even simpler, a pair of glasses, can make millions more see.
If we add to that the many of us here now
who are more productive because they have a pair of glasses,
then almost one in five Indians will require eye care,
a staggering 200 million people.
Today, we're reaching not even 10 percent of them.
So this is the context in which Aravind came into existence
about 30 years back
as a post-retirement project of Dr. V.
He started this with no money.
He had to mortgage all his life savings
to make a bank loan.
And over time, we have grown into a network of five hospitals,
predominately in the state of Tamil Nadu and Puducherry,
and then we added several, what we call Vision Centers
as a hub-and-spoke model.
And then more recently we started managing hospitals
in other parts of the country
and also setting up hospitals in other parts of the world as well.
The last three decades,
we have done about three-and-a-half million surgeries,
a vast majority of them for the poor people.
Now, each year we perform about 300,000 surgeries.
A typical day at Aravind, we would do about a thousand surgeries,
maybe see about 6,000 patients,
send out teams into the villages to examine, bring back patients,
lots of telemedicine consultations,
and, on top of that, do a lot of training,
both for doctors and technicians who will become the future staff of Aravind.
And then doing this day-in and day-out, and doing it well,
requires a lot of inspiration and a lot of hard work.
And I think this was possible thanks to the building blocks
put in place by Dr. V.,
a value system, an efficient delivery process,
and fostering the culture of innovation.
(Music)
Dr. V: I used to sit with the ordinary village man because I am from a village,
and suddenly you turn around and seem to be in contact with his inner being,
you seem to be one with him.
Here is a soul which has got all the simplicity of confidence.
Doctor, whatever you say, I accept it.
An implicit faith in you
and then you respond to it.
Here is an old lady who has got so much faith in me, I must do my best for her.
When we grow in spiritual consciousness,
we identify ourselves with all that is in the world,
so there is no exploitation.
It is ourselves we are helping.
It is ourselves we are healing.
(Applause)
This helped us build a very ethical and very highly patient-centric organization
and systems that support it.
But on a practical level, you also have to deliver services efficiently,
and, odd as it may seem, the inspiration came from McDonald's.
Dr. V: See, McDonald's' concept is simple.
They feel they can train people all over the world,
irrespective of different religions, cultures, all those things,
to produce a product in the same way
and deliver it in the same manner
in hundreds of places.
Larry Brilliant: He kept talking about McDonalds and hamburgers,
and none of it made any sense to us.
He wanted to create a franchise,
a mechanism of delivery of eye care
with the efficiency of McDonald's.
Dr. V: Supposing I'm able to produce eye care,
techniques, methods, all in the same way,
and make it available in every corner of the world.
The problem of blindness is gone.
TR: If you think about it, I think the eyeball is the same,
as American or African,
the problem is the same, the treatment is the same.
And yet, why should there be so much variation in quality and in service,
and that was the fundamental principle that we followed
when we designed the delivery systems.
And, of course, the challenge was that it's a huge problem,
we are talking of millions of people,
very little resource to deal with it,
and then lots of logistics and affordability issues.
And then so, one had to constantly innovate.
And one of the early innovations, which still continues,
is to create ownership in the community to the problem,
and then engage with them as a partner,
and here is one such event.
Here a community camp just organized
by the community themselves,
where they find a place, organize volunteers,
and then we'll do our part. You know, check their vision,
and then you have doctors who you find out what the problem is
and then determine what further testing should be done,
and then those tests are done by technicians
who check for glasses,
or check for glaucoma.
And then, with all these results, the doctor makes a final diagnosis,
and then prescribes a line of treatment,
and if they need a pair of glasses, they are available right there at the camp site,
usually under a tree.
But they get glasses in the frames of their choice,
and that's very important because I think glasses,
in addition to helping people see,
is also a fashion statement, and they're willing to pay for it.
So they get it in about 20 minutes
and those who require surgery, are counseled,
and then there are buses waiting,
which will transport them to the base hospital.
And if it was not for this kind of logistics and support,
many people like this would probably never get services,
and certainly not when they most need it.
They receive surgery the following day,
and then they will stay for a day or two,
and then they are put back on the buses
to be taken back to where they came from,
and where their families will be waiting to take them back home.
(Applause)
And this happens several thousand times each year.
It may sound impressive that we're seeing lots of patients,
very efficient process,
but we looked at, are we solving the problem?
We did a study, a scientifically designed process,
and then, to our dismay,
we found this was only reaching seven percent of those in need,
and we're not adequately addressing more, bigger problems.
So we had to do something different,
so we set up what we call primary eye care centers, vision centers.
These are truly paperless offices
with completely electronic medical records and so on.
They receive comprehensive eye exams.
We kind of changed the simple digital camera into a retinal camera,
and then every patient gets their teleconsultation with a doctor.
The effect of this has been that, within the first year,
we really had a 40 percent penetration in the market that it served,
which is over 50,000 people.
And the second year went up to 75 percent.
So I think we have a process by which
we can really penetrate into the market
and reach everyone who needs it,
and in this process of using technology, make sure
that most don't need to come to the base hospital.
And how much will they pay for this?
We fixed the pricing, taking into account
what they would save in bus fare in coming to a city,
so they pay about 20 rupees, and that's good for three consultations.
(Applause)
The other challenge was, how do you give high-tech
or more advanced treatment and care?
We designed a van with a VSAT,
which sends out images of patients to the base hospital
where it is diagnosed,
and then as the patient is waiting, the report goes back to the patient,
it gets printed out, the patient gets it,
and then gets a consultation about what they should be doing --
I mean, go see a doctor or come back after six months,
and then this happens as a way of
bridging the technology competence.
So the impact of all this has been essentially one of growing the market,
because it focused on the non-customer,
and then by reaching the unreached,
we're able to significantly grow the market.
The other aspect is how do you deal with this efficiently
when you have very few ophthalmologists?
So what is in this video is a surgeon operating,
and then you see on the other side,
another patient is getting ready.
So, as they finish the surgery,
they just swing the microscope over,
the tables are placed so that their distance is just right,
and then we need to do this, because, by doing this kind of process,
we're able to more than quadruple the productivity of the surgeon.
And then to support the surgeon,
we require a certain workforce.
And then we focused on village girls that we recruited,
and then they really are the backbone of the organization.
They do almost all of the skill-based routine tasks.
They do one thing at a time. They do it extremely well.
With the result we have very high productivity,
very high quality at very, very low cost.
So, putting all this together, what really happened was
the productivity of our staff was
significantly higher than anyone else.
(Applause)
This is a very busy table,
but what this really is conveying is that,
when it comes to quality, we have put in
very good quality-assurance systems.
As a result, our complications are significantly lower
than what has been reported in the United Kingdom,
and you don't see those kind of numbers very often.
(Applause)
So the final part of the puzzle is,
how do you make all this work financially,
especially when the people can't pay for it?
So what we did was, we gave away a lot of it for free,
and then those who pay, I mean, they paid local market rates,
nothing more, and often much less.
And we were helped by the market inefficiency.
I think that has been a big savior, even now.
And, of course, one needs the mindset to be wanting to give away
what you have as a surplus.
The result has been, over the years,
the expenditure has increased with volumes.
The revenues increase at a higher level,
giving us a healthy margin
while you're treating a large number of people for free.
I think in absolute terms,
last year we earned about 20-odd million dollars,
spent about 13 million, with over a 40 percent EBITA.
(Applause)
But this really requires going beyond what we do,
or what we have done,
if you really want to achieve solving this problem of blindness.
And what we did was a couple of very counter-intuitive things.
We created competition for ourselves,
and then we made eye care affordable
by making low-cost consumables.
We proactively and systematically
promoted these practices to many hospitals in India,
many in our own backyards and then in other parts of the world as well.
The impact of this has been that these hospitals,
in the second year after our consultation,
are double their output
and then achieve financial recovery as well.
The other part was how do you address
this increase in cost of technology?
There was a time when we failed to negotiate
the [intra-ocular lens] prices to be at affordable levels,
so we set up a manufacturing unit.
And then, over time, we were able to bring down the cost significantly
to about two percent of what it used to be when we started out.
Today, we believe we have about seven percent of the global market,
and they're used in about 120-odd countries.
To conclude, I mean, what we do, does it have a broader relevance,
or is it just India or developing countries?
So to address this, we studied UK versus Aravind.
What it shows is that we do roughly about 60 percent
of the volume of what the UK does,
near a half-million surgeries as a whole country.
And we do about 300,000.
And then we train about 50 ophthalmologists
against the 70 trained by them,
comparable quality, both in training and in patient care.
So we're really comparing apples to apples.
We looked at cost.
(Laughter)
(Applause)
So, I think it is simple to say
just because the U.K. isn't India the difference is happening.
I think there is more to it.
I mean, I think one has to look at other aspects as well.
Maybe there is --
the solution to the cost could be in productivity,
maybe in efficiency, in the clinical process,
or in how much they pay for the lenses or consumables,
or regulations, their defensive practice.
So, I think decoding this can probably bring
answers to most developed countries
including the U.S., and maybe
Obama's ratings can go up again.
(Laughter)
Another insight, which, again, I want to leave with you,
in conditions where the problem is very large,
which cuts across all economic strata,
where we have a good solution,
I think the process I described,
you know, productivity, quality, patient-centered care,
can give an answer,
and there are many which fit this paradigm.
You take dentistry, hearing aid, maternity and so on.
There are many where this paradigm can now play,
but I think probably one of the most challenging things
is on the softer side.
Now, how do you create compassion?
Now, how do you make people own the problem,
want to do something about it?
There are a bit harder issues.
And I'm sure people in this crowd can probably find the solutions to these.
So I want to end my talk leaving this thought and challenge to you.
Dr. V: When you grow in spiritual consciousness,
we identify with all that is in the world
so there is no exploitation.
It is ourselves we are helping.
It is ourselves we are healing.
TR: Thank you very much.
(Applause)
When I was first learning to meditate,
the instruction was to simply
pay attention to my breath,
and when my mind wandered,
to bring it back.
Sounded simple enough.
Yet I'd sit on these silent retreats,
sweating through T-shirts
in the middle of winter.
I'd take naps every chance I got
because it was really hard work.
Actually, it was exhausting.
The instruction was simple enough
but I was missing something
really important.
So why is it so hard to pay attention?
Well, studies show
that even when we're really
trying to pay attention to something --
like maybe this talk --
at some point,
about half of us
will drift off into a daydream,
or have this urge
to check our Twitter feed.
So what's going on here?
It turns out that we're fighting one
of the most evolutionarily-conserved
learning processes
currently known in science,
one that's conserved
back to the most basic
nervous systems known to man.
This reward-based learning process
is called positive
and negative reinforcement,
and basically goes like this.
We see some food that looks good,
our brain says, "Calories! ... Survival!"
We eat the food, we taste it --
it tastes good.
And especially with sugar,
our bodies send a signal
to our brain that says,
"Remember what you're eating
and where you found it."
We lay down this context-dependent memory
and learn to repeat the process next time.
See food,
eat food, feel good,
repeat.
Trigger, behavior, reward.
Simple, right?
Well, after a while,
our creative brains say,
"You know what?
You can use this for more
than just remembering where food is.
You know, next time you feel bad,
why don't you try eating
something good so you'll feel better?"
We thank our brains for the great idea,
try this and quickly learn
that if we eat chocolate or ice cream
when we're mad or sad,
we feel better.
Same process,
just a different trigger.
Instead of this hunger signal
coming from our stomach,
this emotional signal -- feeling sad --
triggers that urge to eat.
Maybe in our teenage years,
we were a nerd at school,
and we see those rebel kids
outside smoking and we think,
"Hey, I want to be cool."
So we start smoking.
The Marlboro Man wasn't a dork,
and that was no accident.
See cool,
smoke to be cool,
feel good. Repeat.
Trigger, behavior, reward.
And each time we do this,
we learn to repeat the process
and it becomes a habit.
So later,
feeling stressed out triggers
that urge to smoke a cigarette
or to eat something sweet.
Now, with these same brain processes,
we've gone from learning to survive
to literally killing ourselves
with these habits.
Obesity and smoking
are among the leading preventable causes
of morbidity and mortality in the world.
So back to my breath.
What if instead of fighting our brains,
or trying to force ourselves
to pay attention,
we instead tapped into this natural,
reward-based learning process ...
but added a twist?
What if instead we just got really curious
about what was happening
in our momentary experience?
I'll give you an example.
In my lab,
we studied whether mindfulness training
could help people quit smoking.
Now, just like trying to force myself
to pay attention to my breath,
they could try to force
themselves to quit smoking.
And the majority of them
had tried this before and failed --
on average, six times.
Now, with mindfulness training,
we dropped the bit about forcing
and instead focused on being curious.
In fact, we even told them to smoke.
What? Yeah, we said, "Go ahead and smoke,
just be really curious
about what it's like when you do."
And what did they notice?
Well here's an example
from one of our smokers.
She said, "Mindful smoking:
smells like stinky cheese
and tastes like chemicals,
YUCK!"
Now, she knew, cognitively
that smoking was bad for her,
that's why she joined our program.
What she discovered just by being
curiously aware when she smoked
was that smoking tastes like shit.
(Laughter)
Now, she moved from knowledge to wisdom.
She moved from knowing in her head
that smoking was bad for her
to knowing it in her bones,
and the spell of smoking was broken.
She started to become
disenchanted with her behavior.
Now, the prefrontal cortex,
that youngest part of our brain
from an evolutionary perspective,
it understands on an intellectual level
that we shouldn't smoke.
And it tries its hardest
to help us change our behavior,
to help us stop smoking,
to help us stop eating that second,
that third, that fourth cookie.
We call this cognitive control.
We're using cognition
to control our behavior.
Unfortunately,
this is also the first part of our brain
that goes offline
when we get stressed out,
which isn't that helpful.
Now, we can all relate to this
in our own experience.
We're much more likely to do things
like yell at our spouse or kids
when we're stressed out or tired,
even though we know
it's not going to be helpful.
We just can't help ourselves.
When the prefrontal cortex goes offline,
we fall back into our old habits,
which is why this disenchantment
is so important.
Seeing what we get from our habits
helps us understand them
at a deeper level --
to know it in our bones
so we don't have to force
ourselves to hold back
or restrain ourselves from behavior.
We're just less interested
in doing it in the first place.
And this is what mindfulness is all about:
Seeing really clearly what we get
when we get caught up in our behaviors,
becoming disenchanted on a visceral level
and from this disenchanted stance,
naturally letting go.
This isn't to say that, poof,
magically we quit smoking.
But over time, as we learn
to see more and more clearly
the results of our actions,
we let go of old habits and form new ones.
The paradox here
is that mindfulness is just
about being really interested
in getting close and personal
with what's actually happening
in our bodies and minds
from moment to moment.
This willingness
to turn toward our experience
rather than trying to make unpleasant
cravings go away as quickly as possible.
And this willingness
to turn toward our experience
is supported by curiosity,
which is naturally rewarding.
What does curiosity feel like?
It feels good.
And what happens when we get curious?
We start to notice that cravings
are simply made up of body sensations --
oh, there's tightness, there's tension,
there's restlessness --
and that these body
sensations come and go.
These are bite-size pieces of experiences
that we can manage from moment to moment
rather than getting clobbered
by this huge, scary craving
that we choke on.
In other words, when we get curious,
we step out of our old,
fear-based, reactive habit patterns,
and we step into being.
We become this inner scientist
where we're eagerly awaiting
that next data point.
Now, this might sound
too simplistic to affect behavior.
But in one study,
we found that mindfulness training
was twice as good as gold standard therapy
at helping people quit smoking.
So it actually works.
And when we studied
the brains of experienced meditators,
we found that parts of a neural network
of self-referential processing
called the default mode network
were at play.
Now, one current hypothesis
is that a region of this network,
called the posterior cingulate cortex,
is activated not necessarily
by craving itself
but when we get caught up in it,
when we get sucked in,
and it takes us for a ride.
In contrast, when we let go --
step out of the process
just by being curiously aware
of what's happening --
this same brain region quiets down.
Now we're testing app and online-based
mindfulness training programs
that target these core mechanisms
and, ironically, use the same technology
that's driving us to distraction
to help us step out
of our unhealthy habit patterns
of smoking, of stress eating
and other addictive behaviors.
Now, remember that bit
about context-dependent memory?
We can deliver these tools
to peoples' fingertips
in the contexts that matter most.
So we can help them
tap into their inherent capacity
to be curiously aware
right when that urge to smoke
or stress eat or whatever arises.
So if you don't smoke or stress eat,
maybe the next time you feel this urge
to check your email when you're bored,
or you're trying to distract
yourself from work,
or maybe to compulsively respond
to that text message when you're driving,
see if you can tap into
this natural capacity,
just be curiously aware
of what's happening in your body
and mind in that moment.
It will just be another chance
to perpetuate one of our endless
and exhaustive habit loops ...
or step out of it.
Instead of see text message,
compulsively text back,
feel a little bit better --
notice the urge,
get curious,
feel the joy of letting go
and repeat.
Thank you.

If we evolved from monkeys,
why are there still monkeys?
(Laughter)
Well, because we're not monkeys,
we're fish.
(Laughter)
Now, knowing you're a fish
and not a monkey
is actually really important
to understanding where we came from.
I teach one of the largest
evolutionary biology classes in the US,
and when my students finally understand
why I call them fish all the time,
then I know I'm getting my job done.
But I always have to start my classes
by dispelling some hardwired myths,
because without really knowing it,
many of us were taught evolution wrong.
For instance, we're taught
to say "the theory of evolution."
There are actually many theories,
and just like the process itself,
the ones that best fit the data
are the ones that survive to this day.
The one we know best
is Darwinian natural selection.
That's the process by which organisms
that best fit an environment
survive and get to reproduce,
while those that are less fit
slowly die off.
And that's it.
Evolution is as simple as that,
and it's a fact.
Evolution is a fact
as much as the "theory of gravity."
You can prove it just as easily.
You just need to look at your bellybutton
that you share
with other placental mammals,
or your backbone that you share
with other vertebrates,
or your DNA that you share
with all other life on earth.
Those traits didn't pop up in humans.
They were passed down
from different ancestors
to all their descendants, not just us.
But that's not really
how we learn biology early on, is it?
We learn plants and bacteria
are primitive things,
and fish give rise to amphibians
followed by reptiles and mammals,
and then you get you,
this perfectly evolved creature
at the end of the line.
But life doesn't evolve in a line,
and it doesn't end with us.
But we're always shown evolution
portrayed something like this,
a monkey and a chimpanzee,
some extinct humans,
all on a forward and steady march
to becoming us.
But they don't become us
any more than we would become them.
We're also not the goal of evolution.
But why does it matter?
Why do we need to understand
evolution the right way?
Well, misunderstanding evolution
has led to many problems,
but you can't ask that age-old question,
"Where are we from?"
without understanding
evolution the right way.
Misunderstanding it has led
to many convoluted and corrupted views
of how we should treat
other life on earth,
and how we should treat each other
in terms of race and gender.
So let's go back four billion years.
This is the single-celled organism
we all came from.
At first, it gave rise
to other single-celled life,
but these are still evolving to this day,
and some would say
the Archaea and Bacteria
that make up most of this group
is the most successful on the planet.
They are certainly going
to be here well after us.
About three billion years ago,
multicellularity evolved.
This includes your fungi
and your plants and your animals.
The first animals to develop
a backbone were fishes.
So technically,
all vertebrates are fishes,
so technically, you and I are fish.
So don't say I didn't warn you.
One fish lineage came onto land
and gave rise to, among other things,
the mammals and reptiles.
Some reptiles become birds,
some mammals become primates,
some primates become monkeys with tails,
and others become the great apes,
including a variety of human species.
So you see, we didn't evolve from monkeys,
but we do share
a common ancestor with them.
All the while, life
around us kept evolving:
more bacteria, more fungi,
lots of fish, fish, fish.
If you couldn't tell --
yes, they're my favorite group.
(Laughter)
As life evolves, it also goes extinct.
Most species just last
for a few million years.
So you see, most life on earth
that we see around us today
are about the same age as our species.
So it's hubris,
it's self-centered to think,
"Oh, plants and bacteria are primitive,
and we've been here
for an evolutionary minute,
so we're somehow special."
Think of life as being this book,
an unfinished book for sure.
We're just seeing the last
few pages of each chapter.
If you look out
on the eight million species
that we share this planet with,
think of them all being
four billion years of evolution.
They're all the product of that.
Think of us all as young leaves
on this ancient and gigantic tree of life,
all of us connected by invisible branches
not just to each other,
but to our extinct relatives
and our evolutionary ancestors.
As a biologist, I'm still
trying to learn, with others,
how everyone's related to each other,
who is related to whom.
Perhaps it's better still
to think of us
as a little fish out of water.
Yes, one that learned to walk and talk,
but one that still has
a lot of learning to do
about who we are and where we came from.
Thank you.
(Applause)
To understand the business of mythology
and what a Chief Belief Officer is supposed to do,
you have to hear a story
of Ganesha,
the elephant-headed god
who is the scribe of storytellers,
and his brother,
the athletic warlord of the gods,
Kartikeya.
The two brothers one day decided to go on a race,
three times around the world.
Kartikeya leapt on his peacock
and flew around the continents
and the mountains and the oceans.
He went around once,
he went around twice,
he went around thrice.
But his brother, Ganesha,
simply walked around his parents
once, twice, thrice,
and said, "I won."
"How come?" said Kartikeya.
And Ganesha said,
"You went around 'the world.'
I went around 'my world.'"
What matters more?
If you understand the difference between 'the world' and 'my world,'
you understand the difference between logos and mythos.
'The world' is objective,
logical, universal, factual,
scientific.
'My world' is subjective.
It's emotional. It's personal.
It's perceptions, thoughts, feelings, dreams.
It is the belief system that we carry.
It's the myth that we live in.
'The world' tells us how the world functions,
how the sun rises,
how we are born.
'My world' tells us why the sun rises,
why we were born.
Every culture is trying to understand itself:
"Why do we exist?"
And every culture comes up with its own understanding of life,
its own customized version of mythology.
Culture is a reaction to nature,
and this understanding of our ancestors
is transmitted generation from generation
in the form of stories, symbols and rituals,
which are always indifferent to rationality.
And so, when you study it, you realize
that different people of the world
have a different understanding of the world.
Different people see things differently --
different viewpoints.
There is my world and there is your world,
and my world is always better than your world,
because my world, you see, is rational
and yours is superstition.
Yours is faith.
Yours is illogical.
This is the root of the clash of civilizations.
It took place, once, in 326 B.C.
on the banks of a river called the Indus,
now in Pakistan.
This river lends itself to India's name.
India. Indus.
Alexander, a young Macedonian,
met there what he called a "gymnosophist,"
which means "the naked, wise man."
We don't know who he was.
Perhaps he was a Jain monk,
like Bahubali over here,
the Gomateshwara Bahubali
whose image is not far from Mysore.
Or perhaps he was just a yogi
who was sitting on a rock, staring at the sky
and the sun and the moon.
Alexander asked, "What are you doing?"
and the gymnosophist answered,
"I'm experiencing nothingness."
Then the gymnosophist asked,
"What are you doing?"
and Alexander said, "I am conquering the world."
And they both laughed.
Each one thought that the other was a fool.
The gymnosophist said, "Why is he conquering the world?
It's pointless."
And Alexander thought,
"Why is he sitting around, doing nothing?
What a waste of a life."
To understand this difference in viewpoints,
we have to understand
the subjective truth of Alexander --
his myth, and the mythology that constructed it.
Alexander's mother, his parents, his teacher Aristotle
told him the story of Homer's "Iliad."
They told him of a great hero called Achilles,
who, when he participated in battle, victory was assured,
but when he withdrew from the battle,
defeat was inevitable.
"Achilles was a man who could shape history,
a man of destiny,
and this is what you should be, Alexander."
That's what he heard.
"What should you not be?
You should not be Sisyphus,
who rolls a rock up a mountain all day
only to find the boulder rolled down at night.
Don't live a life which is monotonous,
mediocre, meaningless.
Be spectacular! --
like the Greek heroes,
like Jason, who went across the sea
with the Argonauts and fetched the Golden Fleece.
Be spectacular like Theseus,
who entered the labyrinth and killed the bull-headed Minotaur.
When you play in a race, win! --
because when you win, the exhilaration of victory
is the closest you will come to the ambrosia of the gods."
Because, you see, the Greeks believed
you live only once,
and when you die, you have to cross the River Styx.
And if you have lived an extraordinary life,
you will be welcomed to Elysium,
or what the French call "Champs-Élysées" --
(Laughter) --
the heaven of the heroes.
But these are not the stories that the gymnosophist heard.
He heard a very different story.
He heard of a man called Bharat,
after whom India is called Bhārata.
Bharat also conquered the world.
And then he went to the top-most peak
of the greatest mountain of the center of the world
called Meru.
And he wanted to hoist his flag to say,
"I was here first."
But when he reached the mountain peak,
he found the peak covered with countless flags
of world-conquerors before him,
each one claiming "'I was here first' ...
that's what I thought until I came here."
And suddenly, in this canvas of infinity,
Bharat felt insignificant.
This was the mythology of the gymnosophist.
You see, he had heroes, like Ram -- Raghupati Ram
and Krishna, Govinda Hari.
But they were not two characters on two different adventures.
They were two lifetimes of the same hero.
When the Ramayana ends the Mahabharata begins.
When Ram dies, Krishna is born.
When Krishna dies, eventually he will be back as Ram.
You see, the Indians also had a river
that separates the land of the living from the land of the dead.
But you don't cross it once.
You go to and fro endlessly.
It was called the Vaitarani.
You go again and again and again.
Because, you see,
nothing lasts forever in India, not even death.
And so, you have these grand rituals
where great images of mother goddesses are built
and worshiped for 10 days ...
And what do you do at the end of 10 days?
You dunk it in the river.
Because it has to end.
And next year, she will come back.
What goes around always comes around,
and this rule applies not just to man,
but also the gods.
You see, the gods
have to come back again and again and again
as Ram, as Krishna.
Not only do they live infinite lives,
but the same life is lived infinite times
till you get to the point of it all.
"Groundhog Day."
(Laughter)
Two different mythologies.
Which is right?
Two different mythologies, two different ways of looking at the world.
One linear, one cyclical.
One believes this is the one and only life.
The other believes this is one of many lives.
And so, the denominator of Alexander's life was one.
So, the value of his life was the sum total
of his achievements.
The denominator of the gymnosophist's life was infinity.
So, no matter what he did,
it was always zero.
And I believe it is this mythological paradigm
that inspired Indian mathematicians
to discover the number zero.
Who knows?
And that brings us to the mythology of business.
If Alexander's belief influenced his behavior,
if the gymnosophist's belief influences his behavior,
then it was bound to influence the business they were in.
You see, what is business
but the result of how the market behaves
and how the organization behaves?
And if you look at cultures around the world,
all you have to do is understand the mythology
and you will see how they behave and how they do business.
Take a look.
If you live only once, in one-life cultures around the world,
you will see an obsession with binary logic,
absolute truth, standardization,
absoluteness, linear patterns in design.
But if you look at cultures which have cyclical
and based on infinite lives, you will see a comfort with fuzzy logic,
with opinion,
with contextual thinking,
with everything is relative, sort of --
(Laughter)
mostly.
(Laughter)
You look at art. Look at the ballerina,
how linear she is in her performance.
And then look at the Indian classical dancer,
the Kuchipudi dancer, the Bharatanatyam dancer,
curvaceous.
(Laughter)
And then look at business.
Standard business model:
vision, mission, values, processes.
Sounds very much like the journey through
the wilderness to the promised land,
with the commandments held by the leader.
And if you comply, you will go to heaven.
But in India there is no "the" promised land.
There are many promised lands,
depending on your station in society,
depending on your stage of life.
You see, businesses are not run as institutions,
by the idiosyncrasies of individuals.
It's always about taste.
It's always about my taste.
You see, Indian music, for example,
does not have the concept of harmony.
There is no orchestra conductor.
There is one performer standing there, and everybody follows.
And you can never replicate that performance twice.
It is not about documentation and contract.
It's about conversation and faith.
It's not about compliance. It's about setting,
getting the job done, by bending or breaking the rules --
just look at your Indian people around here,
you'll see them smile; they know what it is.
(Laughter)
And then look at people who have done business in India,
you'll see the exasperation on their faces.
(Laughter)
(Applause)
You see, this is what India is today. The ground reality
is based on a cyclical world view.
So, it's rapidly changing, highly diverse,
chaotic, ambiguous, unpredictable.
And people are okay with it.
And then globalization is taking place.
The demands of modern institutional thinking is coming in.
Which is rooted in one-life culture.
And a clash is going to take place,
like on the banks of the Indus.
It is bound to happen.
I have personally experienced it. I'm trained as a medical doctor.
I did not want to study surgery. Don't ask me why.
I love mythology too much.
I wanted to learn mythology. But there is nowhere you can study.
So, I had to teach it to myself.
And mythology does not pay, well, until now.
(Laughter)
So, I had to take up a job. And I worked in the pharma industry.
And I worked in the healthcare industry.
And I worked as a marketing guy, and a sales guy,
and a knowledge guy, and a content guy, and a training guy.
I even was a business consultant, doing strategies and tactics.
And I would see the exasperation
between my American and European colleagues,
when they were dealing with India.
Example: Please tell us the process
to invoice hospitals.
Step A. Step B. Step C. Mostly.
(Laughter)
How do you parameterize "mostly"?
How do you put it in a nice little software? You can't.
I would give my viewpoints to people.
But nobody was interested in listening to it,
you see, until I met Kishore Biyani of the Future group.
You see, he has established the largest retail chain, called Big Bazaar.
And there are more than 200 formats,
across 50 cities and towns of India.
And he was dealing with diverse and dynamic markets.
And he knew very intuitively,
that best practices,
developed in Japan and China and Europe and America
will not work in India.
He knew that institutional thinking doesn't work in India. Individual thinking does.
He had an intuitive understanding of the mythic structure of India.
So, he had asked me to be the Chief Belief Officer, and said,
"All I want to do is align belief."
Sounds so simple.
But belief is not measurable.
You can't measure it. You can't manage it.
So, how do you construct belief?
How do you enhance the sensitivity of people to Indian-ness.
Even if you are Indian, it is not very explicit, it is not very obvious.
So, I tried to work on the standard model of culture,
which is, develop stories, symbols and rituals.
And I will share one of the rituals with you.
You see it is based on the Hindu ritual of Darshan.
Hindus don't have the concept of commandments.
So, there is nothing right or wrong in what you do in life.
So, you're not really sure how you stand in front of God.
So, when you go to the temple, all you seek is an audience with God.
You want to see God.
And you want God to see you, and hence the gods have very large eyes,
large unblinking eyes,
sometimes made of silver,
so they look at you.
Because you don't know whether you're right or wrong, and so all you seek
is divine empathy.
"Just know where I came from, why I did the Jugaad."
(Laughter)
"Why did I do the setting,
why I don't care for the processes. Just understand me, please."
And based on this, we created a ritual for leaders.
After a leader completes his training and is about to take over the store,
we blindfold him, we surround him with the stakeholders,
the customer, his family, his team, his boss.
You read out his KRA, his KPI, you give him the keys,
and then you remove the blindfold.
And invariably, you see a tear,
because the penny has dropped.
He realizes that to succeed,
he does not have to be a "professional,"
he does not have to cut out his emotions,
he has to include all these people
in his world to succeed, to make them happy,
to make the boss happy, to make everyone happy.
The customer is happy, because the customer is God.
That sensitivity is what we need. Once this belief enters,
behavior will happen, business will happen.
And it has.
So, then we come back to Alexander
and to the gymnosophist.
And everybody asks me, "Which is the better way, this way or that way?"
And it's a very dangerous question,
because it leads you to the path of fundamentalism and violence.
So, I will not answer the question.
What I will give you is an Indian answer,
the Indian head-shake.
(Laughter)
(Applause)
Depending on the context,
depending on the outcome,
choose your paradigm.
You see, because both the paradigms are human constructions.
They are cultural creations,
not natural phenomena.
And so the next time you meet someone, a stranger,
one request:
Understand that you live in the subjective truth,
and so does he.
Understand it.
And when you understand it you will discover something spectacular.
You will discover that within infinite myths
lies the eternal truth.
Who sees it all?
Varuna has but a thousand eyes.
Indra, a hundred.
You and I, only two.
Thank you. Namaste.
(Applause)
I'm speaking about compassion from an Islamic point of view,
and perhaps my faith is not very well thought of
as being one that is grounded in compassion.
The truth of the matter is otherwise.
Our holy book, the Koran, consists of 114 chapters,
and each chapter begins with what we call the basmala,
the saying of "In the name of God, the all compassionate, the all merciful,"
or, as Sir Richard Burton --
not the Richard Burton who was married to Elizabeth Taylor,
but the Sir Richard Burton who lived a century before that
and who was a worldwide traveler
and translator of many works of literature --
translates it. "In the name of God, the compassionating, the compassionate."
And in a saying of the Koran, which to Muslims is God speaking to humanity,
God says to his prophet Muhammad --
whom we believe to be the last of a series of prophets,
beginning with Adam, including Noah, including Moses, including Abraham,
including Jesus Christ, and ending with Muhammad --
that, "We have not sent you, O Muhammad,
except as a 'rahmah,' except as a source of compassion to humanity."
For us human beings, and certainly for us as Muslims,
whose mission, and whose purpose in following the path of the prophet
is to make ourselves as much like the prophet.
And the prophet, in one of his sayings, said,
"Adorn yourselves with the attributes of God."
And because God Himself said that the primary attribute of his is compassion --
in fact, the Koran says that "God decreed upon himself compassion,"
or, "reigned himself in by compassion" --
therefore, our objective and our mission must be to be sources of compassion,
activators of compassion, actors of compassion
and speakers of compassion and doers of compassion.
That is all well and good,
but where do we go wrong,
and what is the source of the lack of compassion in the world?
For the answer to this, we turn to our spiritual path.
In every religious tradition, there is the outer path and the inner path,
or the exoteric path and the esoteric path.
The esoteric path of Islam is more popularly known as Sufism, or "tasawwuf" in Arabic.
And these doctors or these masters,
these spiritual masters of the Sufi tradition,
refer to teachings and examples of our prophet
that teach us where the source of our problems lies.
In one of the battles that the prophet waged,
he told his followers, "We are returning from the lesser war
to the greater war, to the greater battle."
And they said, "Messenger of God, we are battle-weary.
How can we go to a greater battle?"
He said, "That is the battle of the self, the battle of the ego."
The sources of human problems have to do with egotism, "I."
The famous Sufi master Rumi, who is very well known to most of you,
has a story in which he talks of a man who goes to the house of a friend,
and he knocks on the door,
and a voice answers, "Who's there?"
"It's me," or, more grammatically correctly, "It is I,"
as we might say in English.
The voice says, "Go away."
After many years of training, of disciplining, of search and struggle,
he comes back.
With much greater humility, he knocks again on the door.
The voice asks, "Who is there?"
He said, "It is you, O heartbreaker."
The door swings open, and the voice says,
"Come in, for there is no room in this house for two I's,"
-- two capital I's, not these eyes -- "for two egos."
And Rumi's stories are metaphors for the spiritual path.
In the presence of God, there is no room for more than one "I,"
and that is the "I" of divinity.
In a teaching -- called a "hadith qudsi" in our tradition --
God says that, "My servant," or "My creature, my human creature,
does not approach me by anything that is dearer to me
than what I have asked them to do."
And those of you who are employers know exactly what I mean.
You want your employees to do what you ask them to do,
and if they've done that, then they can do extra.
But don't ignore what you've asked them to do.
"And," God says, "my servant continues to get nearer to me,
by doing more of what I've asked them to do" --
extra credit, we might call it --
"until I love him or love her.
And when I love my servant," God says,
"I become the eyes by which he or she sees,
the ears by which he or she listens,
the hand by which he or she grasps,
and the foot by which he or she walks,
and the heart by which he or she understands."
It is this merging of our self with divinity
that is the lesson and purpose of our spiritual path and all of our faith traditions.
Muslims regard Jesus as the master of Sufism,
the greatest prophet and messenger who came to emphasize the spiritual path.
When he says, "I am the spirit, and I am the way,"
and when the prophet Muhammad said, "Whoever has seen me has seen God,"
it is because they became so much an instrument of God,
they became part of God's team --
so that God's will was manifest through them,
and they were not acting from their own selves and their own egos.
Compassion on earth is given, it is in us.
All we have to do is to get our egos out of the way,
get our egotism out of the way.
I'm sure, probably all of you here, or certainly the very vast majority of you,
have had what you might call a spiritual experience,
a moment in your lives when, for a few seconds, a minute perhaps,
the boundaries of your ego dissolved.
And at that minute, you felt at one with the universe --
one with that jug of water, one with every human being,
one with the Creator --
and you felt you were in the presence of power, of awe,
of the deepest love, the deepest sense of compassion and mercy
that you have ever experienced in your lives.
That is a moment which is a gift of God to us --
a gift when, for a moment, he lifts that boundary
which makes us insist on "I, I, I, me, me, me,"
and instead, like the person in Rumi's story,
we say, "Oh, this is all you.
This is all you. And this is all us.
And us, and I, and us are all part of you.
O, Creator! O, the Objective! The source of our being
and the end of our journey,
you are also the breaker of our hearts.
You are the one whom we should all be towards, for whose purpose we live,
and for whose purpose we shall die,
and for whose purpose we shall be resurrected again
to account to God to what extent we have been compassionate beings."
Our message today, and our purpose today,
and those of you who are here today,
and the purpose of this charter of compassion, is to remind.
For the Koran always urges us to remember, to remind each other,
because the knowledge of truth is within every human being.
We know it all.
We have access to it all.
Jung may have called it "the subconscious."
Through our subconscious, in your dreams --
the Koran calls our state of sleep "the lesser death,"
"the temporary death" --
in our state of sleep we have dreams, we have visions,
we travel even outside of our bodies, for many of us,
and we see wonderful things.
We travel beyond the limitations of space as we know it,
and beyond the limitations of time as we know it.
But all this is for us to glorify the name of the creator
whose primary name is the compassionating, the compassionate.
God, Bokh, whatever name you want to call him with, Allah, Ram, Om,
whatever the name might be through which you name
or access the presence of divinity,
it is the locus of absolute being,
absolute love and mercy and compassion,
and absolute knowledge and wisdom,
what Hindus call "satchidananda."
The language differs,
but the objective is the same.
Rumi has another story
about three men, a Turk, an Arab and --
and I forget the third person, but for my sake, it could be a Malay.
One is asking for angur -- one is, say, an Englishman --
one is asking for eneb, and one is asking for grapes.
And they have a fight and an argument because
-- "I want grapes." "I want eneb. "I want angur." --
not knowing that the word that they're using
refers to the same reality in different languages.
There's only one absolute reality by definition,
one absolute being by definition,
because absolute is, by definition, single,
and absolute and singular.
There's this absolute concentration of being,
the absolute concentration of consciousness,
awareness, an absolute locus of compassion and love
that defines the primary attributes of divinity.
And these should also be
the primary attributes of what it means to be human.
For what defines humanity, perhaps biologically,
is our physiology,
but God defines humanity by our spirituality, by our nature.
And the Koran says, He speaks to the angels and says,
"When I have finished the formation of Adam from clay,
and breathed into him of my spirit,
then, fall in prostration to him."
The angels prostrate, not before the human body,
but before the human soul.
Why? Because the soul, the human soul,
embodies a piece of the divine breath,
a piece of the divine soul.
This is also expressed in biblical vocabulary
when we are taught that we were created in the divine image.
What is the imagery of God?
The imagery of God is absolute being,
absolute awareness and knowledge and wisdom
and absolute compassion and love.
And therefore, for us to be human --
in the greatest sense of what it means to be human,
in the most joyful sense of what it means to be human --
means that we too have to be proper stewards
of the breath of divinity within us,
and seek to perfect within ourselves the attribute of being,
of being alive, of beingness;
the attribute of wisdom, of consciousness, of awareness;
and the attribute of being compassionate and loving beings.
This is what I understand from my faith tradition,
and this is what I understand from my studies of other faith traditions,
and this is the common platform on which we must all stand,
and when we stand on this platform as such,
I am convinced that we can make a wonderful world.
And I believe, personally, that we're on the verge
and that, with the presence and help of people like you here,
we can bring about the prophecy of Isaiah.
For he foretold of a period
when people shall transform their swords into plowshares
and will not learn war or make war anymore.
We have reached a stage in human history that we have no option:
we must, we must lower our egos,
control our egos -- whether it is individual ego, personal ego,
family ego, national ego --
and let all be for the glorification of the one.
Thank you, and God bless you.
(Applause)
According to the theories
of human social development,
we're now living
through the fourth great epoch
of technological advancement,
the Information Age.
Connectivity through digital technology
is a modern miracle.
We can say it has broken down barriers
of time and space which separate people,
and it's created a condition for an age
where information, ideas
can be shared freely.
But are these great accomplishments
in digital technology
really the endgame
in terms of what can be achieved?
I don't think so,
and today I'd like to share with you
how I believe digital technology
can take us to even greater heights.
I'm a surgeon by profession,
and as I stand here today
talking to all of you,
five billion people around the world
lack access to safe surgical care.
Five billion people.
That's 70 percent
of the world's population,
who according to the WHO's
Lancet Commission
can't even access
simple surgical procedures
as and when they need them.
Let's zoom in on Sierra Leone,
a country of six million people,
where a recent study showed
that there are only 10 qualified surgeons.
That's one surgeon
for every 600,000 people.
The numbers are staggering,
and we don't even need to look that far.
If we look around us here in the US,
a recent study reported that we need
an extra 100,000 surgeons by 2030
to just keep up with the demand
for routine surgical procedures.
At the rate that we're going,
we won't be meeting those numbers.
As a surgeon, this is
a global issue that bothers me.
It bothers me a lot,
because I've seen firsthand
how lack of access
to safe and affordable healthcare
can blight the lives of ordinary people.
If you're a patient
that needs an operation
and there isn't a surgeon available,
you're left with some
really difficult choices:
to wait, to travel,
or not to have an operation at all.
So what's the answer?
Well, part of you are carrying
some of that solution with you today:
a smartphone, a tablet, a computer.
Because for me,
digital communications technology
has the power to do so much more
than just to allow us to shop online,
to connect through social media platforms
and to stay up to date.
It has the power to help us solve
some of the key issues that we face,
like lack of access
to vital surgical services.
And today I'd like to share with you
an example of how I think
we can make that possible.
The history of surgery
is filled with breakthroughs
in how science and technology
was able to help the surgeons of the day
face their greatest challenges.
If we go back several hundred years,
an understanding of microbiology
led to the development
of antiseptic techniques,
which played a big role in making sure
patients were able
to stay alive postsurgery.
Fast-forward a few hundred years
and we developed
keyhole or arthroscopic surgery,
which combines video technology
and precision instruments
to make surgery less invasive.
And more recently, a lot of you
will be aware of robotic surgery,
and what robotics brings to surgery
is much like modern automated machinery,
ultraprecision,
the ability to carry out procedures
at the tiniest scales
with a degree of accuracy
that even surpasses the human hand.
But robotic surgery also introduced
something else to surgery:
the idea that a surgeon
doesn't actually have to be standing
at the patient's bedside to deliver care,
that he could be looking at a screen
and instructing a robot
through a computer.
We call this remote surgery.
It is incumbent on us
to find solutions that solve these answers
in a cost-effective and scalable way,
so that everyone, no matter
where they are in the world,
can have these problems addressed.
So what if I told you
that you didn't really need
a million-dollar robot
to provide remote surgery?
That all you needed
was a phone, a tablet, or a computer,
an internet connection,
a confident colleague on the ground
and one magic ingredient:
an augmented reality
collaboration software.
Using this augmented reality
collaboration software,
an expert surgeon
can now virtually transport himself
into any clinical setting
simply by using his phone
or tablet or computer,
and he can visually and practically
interact in an operation
from start to finish,
guiding and mentoring a local doctor
through the procedure step by step.
Well, enough of me telling you about it.
I'd now like to show you.
We're now going to go live
to Dr. Marc Tompkins,
an orthopedic surgeon
at the University of Minnesota.
He's going to perform
an arthroscopic surgery for us,
a keyhole surgery of the knee,
and I'd like to disclose
that this patient has consented
to having their operation streamed.
I'd also like to point out
that in the interest of time,
we're just going to go
through the first steps,
marking up the patient
and just identifying
a few key anatomical landmarks.
Hello, Dr. Tompkins, can you hear me?
Dr. Mark Tompkins: Good morning, Nadine.
Nadine Hachach-Haram:
Everyone from TED says hello.
Audience: Hi.
NHH: Alright, Dr. Tompkins,
let's get started.
So let's start with our incisions
and where we're going to make these,
on either side of the patellar tendon.
So if you can make
your incisions there and there,
that should hopefully
get us into the knee.
MT: All right, I'm going in.
NHH: Great.
So we're just getting
inside the joint now.
So why don't we go around
and have a quick look at the meniscus.
MT: Perfect.
NHH: Great, so we can see there's
a small tear there on the meniscus,
but otherwise it looks alright.
And if you turn
and head to this direction,
follow my finger,
let's have a quick look
at the ACL and the PCL.
That's your ACL there,
that looks quite healthy,
no problems there.
So we've just identified
that small meniscus tear there,
but otherwise the fluid
around the joint looks OK as well.
All right, thank you very much,
Dr. Tompkins. Thank you for your time.
I'll let you continue.
Have a good day. Bye.
(Applause)
So I hope through
this simple demonstration
I was able to illustrate to you
just how powerful this technology can be.
And I'd like to point out
that I wasn't using any special equipment,
just my laptop and a really simple webcam.
We're so used to using digital technology
to communicate through voice
and text and video,
but augmented reality
can do something so much deeper.
It allows two people to virtually interact
in a way that mimics
how they would collaborate in person.
Being able to show someone
what you want to do,
to illustrate and demonstrate and gesture,
is so much more powerful
than just telling them.
And it can make
for such a great learning tool,
because we learn better
through direct experience.
So how is this making
a difference around the world?
Well, back in my teaching hospital,
we've been using this to support
local district general hospitals
and providing skin cancer surgery
and trauma treatment.
Now, patients can access
care at a local level.
This reduces their travel time,
improves their access,
and saves money.
We've even started seeing its use
in wound care management with nurses
and in outpatient management.
Most recently, and quite exciting,
it was used in supporting a surgeon
through a cancer removal of a kidney.
And I'd like to just share with you
a very quick video here.
I apologize for some
of the gruesome views.
(Video) Doctor 1: OK. Show me again.
Doctor 2: If you see here,
that's the upper part,
the most outer part of your tumor.
Doctor 1: Yes.
Doctor 2: So it's
three centimeters deep,
so this should be three centimeters.
Doctor 1: Yes, yes.
Doctor 2: OK,
so you need to get a 3.5 margin.
Doctor 1: I'm going to show you anyway
and tell me what you think about it.
NHH: We're also seeing the use
of this technology at a global scale,
and one of the most
heartwarming stories I can recall
is from the town of Trujillo
in the north of Lima in Peru,
where this technology
was used to support the provision
of cleft lip and palate
surgery to children,
children from poor backgrounds who
didn't have access to health insurance.
And in this town, there was
a hospital with one surgeon
working hard to provide this care,
Dr. Soraya.
Now, Dr. Soraya was struggling
under the sheer demand
of her local population,
as well as the fact that she wasn't
specifically trained in this procedure.
And so, with the help of a charity,
we were able to connect her
with a cleft surgeon in California,
and using this technology, he was able
to guide her and her colleagues
through the procedure step by step,
guiding them, training them
and teaching them.
Within a few months,
they were able to perform
30 percent more operations
with less and less complications.
And now Dr. Soraya and her team
can perform these operations
independently, competently
and confidently.
And I remember one quote
from a mother who said,
"This technology
gave my daughter her smile."
For me, this is the real power
of this technology.
The beauty is that it breaks boundaries.
It transcends all
technological difficulties.
It connects people.
It democratizes access.
Wi-Fi and mobile technology
are growing rapidly,
and they should play a role
in boosting surgical provision.
We've even seen it used in conflict zones
where there's considerable risk
in getting specialist surgeons
to certain locations.
In a world where
there are more mobile devices
than there are human beings,
it truly has a global reach.
Of course, we've still got a long way
before we can solve the problem
of getting surgery to five billion people,
and unfortunately,
some people still
don't have access to internet.
But things are rapidly moving
in the right direction.
The potential for change is there.
My team and I are growing
our global footprint,
and we're starting to see
the potential of this technology.
Through digital technology,
through simple, everyday devices
that we take for granted,
through devices of the future,
we can really do miraculous things.
Thank you.
(Applause)
As an Indian, and now as a politician
and a government minister,
I've become rather concerned about
the hype we're hearing about our own country,
all this talk about India becoming a world leader,
even the next superpower.
In fact, the American publishers of my book,
"The Elephant, The Tiger and the Cell Phone,"
added a gratuitous subtitle saying,
"India: The next 21st-century power."
And I just don't think that's what India's all about,
or should be all about.
Indeed, what worries me is the entire notion of world leadership
seems to me terribly archaic.
It's redolent of James Bond movies
and Kipling ballads.
After all, what constitutes a world leader?
If it's population, we're on course to top the charts.
We will overtake China by 2034.
Is it military strength? Well, we have the world's fourth largest army.
Is it nuclear capacity? We know we have that.
The Americans have even recognized it,
in an agreement.
Is it the economy? Well, we have now
the fifth-largest economy in the world
in purchasing power parity terms.
And we continue to grow. When the rest of the world took a beating last year,
we grew at 6.7 percent.
But, somehow, none of that adds up to me,
to what I think India really can aim to contribute in the world,
in this part of the 21st century.
And so I wondered, could
what the future beckons for India to be all about
be a combination of these things allied to something else,
the power of example,
the attraction of India's culture,
what, in other words, people like to call "soft power."
Soft power is a concept invented by a Harvard academic,
Joseph Nye, a friend of mine.
And, very simply, and I'm really cutting it short because of the time limits here,
it's essentially the ability of a country to attract others
because of its culture, its political values,
its foreign policies.
And, you know, lots of countries do this. He was writing initially about the States,
but we know the Alliance Francaise
is all about French soft power, the British Council.
The Beijing Olympics were an exercise in Chinese soft power.
Americans have the Voice of America and the Fulbright scholarships.
But, the fact is, in fact,
that probably Hollywood and MTV and McDonalds
have done more for American soft power
around the world than any specifically government activity.
So soft power is something that really emerges
partly because of governments,
but partly despite governments.
And in the information era we all live in today,
what we might call the TED age,
I'd say that countries are increasingly being judged
by a global public that's been fed
on an incessant diet of Internet news,
of televised images,
of cellphone videos, of email gossip.
In other words, all sorts of communication devices
are telling us the stories of countries,
whether or not the countries concerned want people to hear those stories.
Now, in this age, again, countries with access
to multiple channels of communication
and information have a particular advantage.
And of course they have more influence, sometimes, about how they're seen.
India has more all-news TV channels
than any country in the world,
in fact in most of the countries in this part of the world put together.
But, the fact still is that it's not just that.
In order to have soft power, you have to be connected.
One might argue that India has become
an astonishingly connected country.
I think you've already heard the figures.
We've been selling 15 million cellphones a month.
Currently there are 509 million cellphones
in Indian hands, in India.
And that makes us larger than the U.S. as a telephone market.
In fact, those 15 million cellphones
are the most connections that any country,
including the U.S. and China,
has ever established in the history of telecommunications.
But, what perhaps some of you don't realize
is how far we've come to get there.
You know, when I grew up in India,
telephones were a rarity.
In fact, they were so rare that elected members of Parliament
had the right to allocate 15 telephone lines
as a favor to those they deemed worthy.
If you were lucky enough to be a wealthy businessman
or an influential journalist, or a doctor or something, you might have a telephone.
But sometimes it just sat there.
I went to high school in Calcutta.
And we would look at this instrument sitting in the front foyer.
But half the time we would pick it up
with an expectant look on our faces,
there would be no dial tone.
If there was a dial tone and you dialed a number,
the odds were two in three you wouldn't get the number you were intending to reach.
In fact the words "wrong number" were more popular than the word "Hello."
(Laughter)
If you then wanted to connect to another city,
let's say from Calcutta you wanted to call Delhi,
you'd have to book something called a trunk call,
and then sit by the phone all day, waiting for it to come through.
Or you could pay eight times the going rate
for something called a lightning call.
But, lightning struck rather slowly in our country in those days,
so, it was like about a half an hour for a lightning call to come through.
In fact, so woeful was our telephone service
that a Member of Parliament stood up in 1984 and complained about this.
And the Then-Communications Minister replied in a lordly manner
that in a developing country
communications are a luxury, not a right,
that the government had no obligation to provide better service,
and if the honorable Member wasn't satisfied with his telephone,
could he please return it, since there was an eight-year-long waiting list
for telephones in India.
Now, fast-forward to today and this is what you see:
the 15 million cell phones a month.
But what is most striking is who is carrying those cell phones.
You know, if you visit friends in the suburbs of Delhi,
on the side streets you will find a fellow with a cart
that looks like it was designed in the 16th century,
wielding a coal-fired steam iron
that might have been invented in the 18th century.
He's called an isthri wala. But he's carrying a 21st-century instrument.
He's carrying a cell phone because most incoming calls are free,
and that's how he gets orders from the neighborhood,
to know where to collect clothes to get them ironed.
The other day I was in Kerala, my home state,
at the country farm of a friend,
about 20 kilometers away from any place you'd consider urban.
And it was a hot day and he said, "Hey, would you like some fresh coconut water?"
And it's the best thing and the most nutritious and refreshing thing you can drink
on a hot day in the tropics, so I said sure.
And he whipped out his cellphone, dialed the number,
and a voice said, "I'm up here."
And right on top of the nearest coconut tree,
with a hatchet in one hand and a cell phone in the other,
was a local toddy tapper,
who proceeded to bring down the coconuts for us to drink.
Fishermen are going out to sea and carrying their cell phones.
When they catch the fish they call all the market towns along the coast
to find out where they get the best possible prices.
Farmers now, who used to have to spend half a day of backbreaking labor
to find out if the market town was open,
if the market was on,
whether the product they'd harvested could be sold, what price they'd fetch.
They'd often send an eight year old boy all the way on this trudge
to the market town to get that information and come back,
then they'd load the cart.
Today they're saving half a day's labor with a two minute phone call.
So this empowerment of the underclass
is the real result of India being connected.
And that transformation is part of where India is heading today.
But, of course that's not the only thing about India that's spreading.
You've got Bollywood. My attitude to Bollywood is best summarized
in the tale of the two goats at a Bollywood garbage dump --
Mr. Shekhar Kapur, forgive me --
and they're chewing away on cans of celluloid discarded by a Bollywood studio.
And the first goat, chewing away, says, "You know, this film is not bad."
And the second goat says, "No, the book was better."
(Laughter)
I usually tend to think that the book is usually better,
but, having said that,
the fact is that Bollywood is now
taking a certain aspect of Indian-ness and Indian culture around the globe,
not just in the Indian diaspora in the U.S. and the U.K.,
but to the screens of Arabs and Africans, of Senegalese and Syrians.
I've met a young man in New York whose illiterate mother
in a village in Senegal
takes a bus once a month to the capital city of Dakar,
just to watch a Bollywood movie.
She can't understand the dialogue.
She's illiterate, so she can't read the French subtitles.
But these movies are made to be understood despite such handicaps,
and she has a great time in the song and the dance and the action.
She goes away with stars in her eyes about India, as a result.
And this is happening more and more.
Afghanistan, we know what a serious security problem
Afghanistan is for so many of us in the world.
India doesn't have a military mission there.
You know what was India's biggest asset in Afghanistan in the last seven years?
One simple fact:
you couldn't try to call an Afghan at 8:30 in the evening.
Why? Because that was the moment
when the Indian television soap opera,
"Kyunki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi," dubbed into Dari, was telecast on Tolo T.V.
And it was the most popular television show in Afghan history.
Every Afghan family wanted to watch it.
They had to suspend functions at 8:30.
Weddings were reported to be interrupted
so guests could cluster around the T.V. set,
and then turn their attention back to the bride and groom.
Crime went up at 8:30. I have read a Reuters dispatch --
so this is not Indian propaganda, a British news agency --
about how robbers in the town of Musarri Sharif*
stripped a vehicle of its windshield wipers,
its hubcaps, its sideview mirrors,
any moving part they could find, at 8:30,
because the watchmen were busy watching the T.V. rather than minding the store.
And they scrawled on the windshield in a reference to the show's heroine,
"Tulsi Zindabad": "Long live Tulsi."
(Laughter)
That's soft power. And that is what India is developing
through the "E" part of TED:
its own entertainment industry.
The same is true, of course -- we don't have time for too many more examples --
but it's true of our music, of our dance,
of our art, yoga, ayurveda, even Indian cuisine.
I mean, the proliferation of Indian restaurants
since I first went abroad as a student, in the mid '70s,
and what I see today, you can't go to a mid-size town in Europe or North America
and not find an Indian restaurant. It may not be a very good one.
But, today in Britain, for example,
Indian restaurants in Britain
employ more people than the coal mining,
ship building and iron and steel industries combined.
So the empire can strike back.
(Applause)
But, with this increasing awareness of India,
with you and with I, and so on,
with tales like Afghanistan,
comes something vital in the information era,
the sense that in today's world
it's not the side of the bigger army that wins,
it's the country that tells a better story that prevails.
And India is, and must remain, in my view, the land of the better story.
Stereotypes are changing. I mean, again, having gone to the U.S.
as a student in the mid '70s,
I knew what the image of India was then, if there was an image at all.
Today, people in Silicon Valley and elsewhere
speak of the IITs, the Indian Institutes of Technology
with the same reverence they used to accord to MIT.
This can sometimes have unintended consequences. OK.
I had a friend, a history major like me,
who was accosted at Schiphol Airport in Amsterdam,
by an anxiously perspiring European saying,
"You're Indian, you're Indian! Can you help me fix my laptop?"
(Laughter)
We've gone from the image of India as
land of fakirs lying on beds of nails,
and snake charmers with the Indian rope trick,
to the image of India as a land of mathematical geniuses,
computer wizards, software gurus.
But that too is transforming the Indian story around the world.
But, there is something more substantive to that.
The story rests on a fundamental platform
of political pluralism.
It's a civilizational story to begin with.
Because India has been an open society for millennia.
India gave refuge to the Jews, fleeing the destruction of the first temple
by the Babylonians, and said thereafter by the Romans.
In fact, legend has is that when Doubting Thomas, the Apostle, Saint Thomas,
landed on the shores of Kerala, my home state,
somewhere around 52 A.D.,
he was welcomed on shore by a flute-playing Jewish girl.
And to this day remains the only Jewish diaspora
in the history of the Jewish people, which has never encountered
a single incident of anti-semitism.
(Applause)
That's the Indian story.
Islam came peacefully to the south,
slightly more differently complicated history in the north.
But all of these religions have found a place and a welcome home in India.
You know, we just celebrated, this year, our general elections,
the biggest exercise in democratic franchise in human history.
And the next one will be even bigger, because our voting population
keeps growing by 20 million a year.
But, the fact is
that the last elections, five years ago,
gave the world extraordinary phenomenon
of an election being won by a woman political leader
of Italian origin and Roman Catholic faith, Sonia Gandhi,
who then made way for a Sikh, Mohan Singh,
to be sworn in as Prime Minister
by a Muslim, President Abdul Kalam,
in a country 81 percent Hindu.
(Applause)
This is India, and of course it's all the more striking
because it was four years later that we all applauded
the U.S., the oldest democracy in the modern world,
more than 220 years of free and fair elections,
which took till last year to elect a president or a vice president
who wasn't white, male or Christian.
So, maybe -- oh sorry, he is Christian, I beg your pardon --
and he is male, but he isn't white.
All the others have been all those three.
(Laughter)
All his predecessors have been all those three,
and that's the point I was trying to make.
(Laughter)
But, the issue is
that when I talked about that example,
it's not just about talking about India, it's not propaganda.
Because ultimately, that electoral outcome
had nothing to do with the rest of the world.
It was essentially India being itself.
And ultimately, it seems to me,
that always works better than propaganda.
Governments aren't very good at telling stories.
But people see a society for what it is,
and that, it seems to me, is what ultimately
will make a difference in today's information era,
in today's TED age.
So India now is no longer
the nationalism of ethnicity or language or religion,
because we have every ethnicity known to mankind, practically,
we've every religion know to mankind,
with the possible exception of Shintoism,
though that has some Hindu elements somewhere.
We have 23 official languages that are recognized in our Constitution.
And those of you who cashed your money here
might be surprised to see how many scripts there are
on the rupee note, spelling out the denominations.
We've got all of that.
We don't even have geography uniting us,
because the natural geography of the subcontinent
framed by the mountains and the sea was hacked
by the partition with Pakistan in 1947.
In fact, you can't even take the name of the country for granted,
because the name "India" comes from the river Indus,
which flows in Pakistan.
But, the whole point is that India
is the nationalism of an idea.
It's the idea of an ever-ever-land,
emerging from an ancient civilization,
united by a shared history,
but sustained, above all, by pluralist democracy.
That is a 21st-century story as well as an ancient one.
And it's the nationalism of an idea that
essentially says you can endure differences of caste, creed,
color, culture, cuisine, custom and costume, consonant, for that matter,
and still rally around a consensus.
And the consensus is of a very simple principle,
that in a diverse plural democracy like India
you don't really have to agree on everything all the time,
so long as you agree on the ground rules
of how you will disagree.
The great success story of India,
a country that so many learned scholars and journalists
assumed would disintegrate, in the '50s and '60s,
is that it managed to maintain consensus on how to survive without consensus.
Now, that is the India that is emerging into the 21st century.
And I do want to make the point
that if there is anything worth celebrating about India,
it isn't military muscle, economic power.
All of that is necessary,
but we still have huge amounts of problems to overcome.
Somebody said we are super poor, and we are also super power.
We can't really be both of those.
We have to overcome our poverty. We have to deal with the
hardware of development,
the ports, the roads, the airports,
all the infrastructural things we need to do,
and the software of development,
the human capital, the need for the ordinary person in India
to be able to have a couple of square meals a day,
to be able to send his or her children
to a decent school,
and to aspire to work a job
that will give them opportunities in their lives
that can transform themselves.
But, it's all taking place, this great adventure of conquering those challenges,
those real challenges which none of us can pretend don't exist.
But, it's all taking place in an open society,
in a rich and diverse and plural civilization,
in one that is determined to liberate and fulfill
the creative energies of its people.
That's why India belongs at TED,
and that's why TED belongs in India.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
What I wanted to talk to you about today is two things:
one, the rise of a culture of availability;
and two, a request.
So we're seeing a rise of this availability
being driven by mobile device proliferation,
globally, across all social strata.
We're seeing, along with that proliferation of mobile devices,
an expectation of availability.
And, with that, comes the third point,
which is obligation -- and an obligation to that availability.
And the problem is, we're still working through,
from a societal standpoint,
how we allow people to be available.
There's a significant delta, in fact,
between what we're willing to accept.
Apologies to Hans Rosling --
he said anything that's not using real stats is a lie --
but the big delta there
is how we deal with this from a public standpoint.
So we've developed certain tactics and strategies
to cover up.
This first one's called "the lean."
And if you've ever been in a meeting where you play sort of meeting "chicken,"
you're sitting there, looking at the person, waiting for them to look away,
and then quickly checking the device.
Although you can see the gentleman up on the right is busting him.
"The stretch."
OK, the gentleman on the left is saying, "Screw you,
I'm going to check my device."
But the guy, here, on the right,
he's doing the stretch.
It's that reeeee-e-e-each out, the physical contortion
to get that device just below the tabletop.
Or, my favorite, the "Love you; mean it."
(Laughter)
Nothing says "I love you"
like "Let me find somebody else I give a damn about."
Or, this one, coming to us from India.
You can find this on YouTube,
the gentleman who's recumbent on a motorcycle
while text messaging.
Or what we call the "sweet gravy, stop me before I kill again!"
That is actually the device.
What this is doing is, we find a --
(Laughter)
a direct collision --
we find a direct collision between availability --
and what's possible through availability --
and a fundamental human need -- which we've been hearing about a lot, actually --
the need to create shared narratives.
We're very good at creating personal narratives,
but it's the shared narratives that make us a culture.
And when you're standing with someone,
and you're on your mobile device,
effectively what you're saying to them is,
"You are not as important as, literally,
almost anything that could come to me through this device."
Look around you.
There might be somebody on one right now,
participating in multi-dimensional engagement.
(Laughter)
Our reality right now is less interesting
than the story we're going to tell about it later.
This one I love.
This poor kid, clearly a prop --
don't get me wrong, a willing prop --
but the kiss that's being documented kind of looks like it sucks.
This is the sound of one hand clapping.
So, as we lose the context of our identity,
it becomes incredibly important
that what you share becomes the context of shared narrative,
becomes the context in which we live.
The stories that we tell -- what we push out --
becomes who we are.
People aren't simply projecting identity,
they're creating it.
And so that's the request I have for everybody in this room.
We are creating the technology
that is going to create the new shared experience,
which will create the new world.
And so my request is,
please, let's make technologies
that make people more human,
and not less.
Thank you.
You know, one of the intense pleasures of travel
and one of the delights of ethnographic research
is the opportunity to live amongst those
who have not forgotten the old ways,
who still feel their past in the wind,
touch it in stones polished by rain,
taste it in the bitter leaves of plants.
Just to know that Jaguar shamans still journey beyond the Milky Way,
or the myths of the Inuit elders still resonate with meaning,
or that in the Himalaya,
the Buddhists still pursue the breath of the Dharma,
is to really remember the central revelation of anthropology,
and that is the idea that the world in which we live
does not exist in some absolute sense,
but is just one model of reality,
the consequence of one particular set of adaptive choices
that our lineage made, albeit successfully, many generations ago.
And of course, we all share the same adaptive imperatives.
We're all born. We all bring our children into the world.
We go through initiation rites.
We have to deal with the inexorable separation of death,
so it shouldn't surprise us that we all sing, we all dance,
we all have art.
But what's interesting is the unique cadence of the song,
the rhythm of the dance in every culture.
And whether it is the Penan in the forests of Borneo,
or the Voodoo acolytes in Haiti,
or the warriors in the Kaisut desert of Northern Kenya,
the Curandero in the mountains of the Andes,
or a caravanserai in the middle of the Sahara --
this is incidentally the fellow that I traveled into the desert with
a month ago --
or indeed a yak herder in the slopes of Qomolangma,
Everest, the goddess mother of the world.
All of these peoples teach us that there are other ways of being,
other ways of thinking,
other ways of orienting yourself in the Earth.
And this is an idea, if you think about it,
can only fill you with hope.
Now, together the myriad cultures of the world
make up a web of spiritual life and cultural life
that envelops the planet,
and is as important to the well-being of the planet
as indeed is the biological web of life that you know as a biosphere.
And you might think of this cultural web of life
as being an ethnosphere,
and you might define the ethnosphere
as being the sum total of all thoughts and dreams, myths,
ideas, inspirations, intuitions brought into being
by the human imagination since the dawn of consciousness.
The ethnosphere is humanity's great legacy.
It's the symbol of all that we are
and all that we can be as an astonishingly inquisitive species.
And just as the biosphere has been severely eroded,
so too is the ethnosphere
-- and, if anything, at a far greater rate.
No biologists, for example, would dare suggest
that 50 percent of all species or more have been or are
on the brink of extinction because it simply is not true,
and yet that -- the most apocalyptic scenario
in the realm of biological diversity --
scarcely approaches what we know to be the most optimistic scenario
in the realm of cultural diversity.
And the great indicator of that, of course, is language loss.
When each of you in this room were born,
there were 6,000 languages spoken on the planet.
Now, a language is not just a body of vocabulary
or a set of grammatical rules.
A language is a flash of the human spirit.
It's a vehicle through which the soul of each particular culture
comes into the material world.
Every language is an old-growth forest of the mind,
a watershed, a thought, an ecosystem of spiritual possibilities.
And of those 6,000 languages, as we sit here today in Monterey,
fully half are no longer being whispered into the ears of children.
They're no longer being taught to babies,
which means, effectively, unless something changes,
they're already dead.
What could be more lonely than to be enveloped in silence,
to be the last of your people to speak your language,
to have no way to pass on the wisdom of the ancestors
or anticipate the promise of the children?
And yet, that dreadful fate is indeed the plight of somebody
somewhere on Earth roughly every two weeks,
because every two weeks, some elder dies
and carries with him into the grave the last syllables
of an ancient tongue.
And I know there's some of you who say, "Well, wouldn't it be better,
wouldn't the world be a better place
if we all just spoke one language?" And I say, "Great,
let's make that language Yoruba. Let's make it Cantonese.
Let's make it Kogi."
And you'll suddenly discover what it would be like
to be unable to speak your own language.
And so, what I'd like to do with you today
is sort of take you on a journey through the ethnosphere,
a brief journey through the ethnosphere,
to try to begin to give you a sense of what in fact is being lost.
Now, there are many of us who sort of forget
that when I say "different ways of being,"
I really do mean different ways of being.
Take, for example, this child of a Barasana in the Northwest Amazon,
the people of the anaconda
who believe that mythologically they came up the milk river
from the east in the belly of sacred snakes.
Now, this is a people who cognitively
do not distinguish the color blue from the color green
because the canopy of the heavens
is equated to the canopy of the forest
upon which the people depend.
They have a curious language and marriage rule
which is called "linguistic exogamy:"
you must marry someone who speaks a different language.
And this is all rooted in the mythological past,
yet the curious thing is in these long houses,
where there are six or seven languages spoken
because of intermarriage,
you never hear anyone practicing a language.
They simply listen and then begin to speak.
Or, one of the most fascinating tribes I ever lived with,
the Waorani of northeastern Ecuador,
an astonishing people first contacted peacefully in 1958.
In 1957, five missionaries attempted contact
and made a critical mistake.
They dropped from the air
8 x 10 glossy photographs of themselves
in what we would say to be friendly gestures,
forgetting that these people of the rainforest
had never seen anything two-dimensional in their lives.
They picked up these photographs from the forest floor,
tried to look behind the face to find the form or the figure,
found nothing, and concluded that these were calling cards
from the devil, so they speared the five missionaries to death.
But the Waorani didn't just spear outsiders.
They speared each other.
54 percent of their mortality was due to them spearing each other.
We traced genealogies back eight generations,
and we found two instances of natural death
and when we pressured the people a little bit about it,
they admitted that one of the fellows had gotten so old
that he died getting old, so we speared him anyway. (Laughter)
But at the same time they had a perspicacious knowledge
of the forest that was astonishing.
Their hunters could smell animal urine at 40 paces
and tell you what species left it behind.
In the early '80s, I had a really astonishing assignment
when I was asked by my professor at Harvard
if I was interested in going down to Haiti,
infiltrating the secret societies
which were the foundation of Duvalier's strength
and Tonton Macoutes,
and securing the poison used to make zombies.
In order to make sense out of sensation, of course,
I had to understand something about this remarkable faith
of Vodoun. And Voodoo is not a black magic cult.
On the contrary, it's a complex metaphysical worldview.
It's interesting.
If I asked you to name the great religions of the world,
what would you say?
Christianity, Islam, Buddhism, Judaism, whatever.
There's always one continent left out,
the assumption being that sub-Saharan Africa
had no religious beliefs. Well, of course, they did
and Voodoo is simply the distillation
of these very profound religious ideas
that came over during the tragic Diaspora of the slavery era.
But, what makes Voodoo so interesting
is that it's this living relationship
between the living and the dead.
So, the living give birth to the spirits.
The spirits can be invoked from beneath the Great Water,
responding to the rhythm of the dance
to momentarily displace the soul of the living,
so that for that brief shining moment, the acolyte becomes the god.
That's why the Voodooists like to say
that "You white people go to church and speak about God.
We dance in the temple and become God."
And because you are possessed, you are taken by the spirit --
how can you be harmed?
So you see these astonishing demonstrations:
Voodoo acolytes in a state of trance
handling burning embers with impunity,
a rather astonishing demonstration of the ability of the mind
to affect the body that bears it
when catalyzed in the state of extreme excitation.
Now, of all the peoples that I've ever been with,
the most extraordinary are the Kogi
of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta in northern Colombia.
Descendants of the ancient Tairona civilization
which once carpeted the Caribbean coastal plain of Colombia,
in the wake of the conquest,
these people retreated into an isolated volcanic massif
that soars above the Caribbean coastal plain.
In a bloodstained continent,
these people alone were never conquered by the Spanish.
To this day, they remain ruled by a ritual priesthood
but the training for the priesthood is rather extraordinary.
The young acolytes are taken away from their families
at the age of three and four,
sequestered in a shadowy world of darkness
in stone huts at the base of glaciers for 18 years:
two nine-year periods
deliberately chosen to mimic the nine months of gestation
they spend in their natural mother's womb;
now they are metaphorically in the womb of the great mother.
And for this entire time,
they are inculturated into the values of their society,
values that maintain the proposition that their prayers
and their prayers alone maintain the cosmic --
or we might say the ecological -- balance.
And at the end of this amazing initiation,
one day they're suddenly taken out
and for the first time in their lives, at the age of 18,
they see a sunrise. And in that crystal moment of awareness
of first light as the Sun begins to bathe the slopes
of the stunningly beautiful landscape,
suddenly everything they have learned in the abstract
is affirmed in stunning glory. And the priest steps back
and says, "You see? It's really as I've told you.
It is that beautiful. It is yours to protect."
They call themselves the "elder brothers"
and they say we, who are the younger brothers,
are the ones responsible for destroying the world.
Now, this level of intuition becomes very important.
Whenever we think of indigenous people and landscape,
we either invoke Rousseau
and the old canard of the "noble savage,"
which is an idea racist in its simplicity,
or alternatively, we invoke Thoreau
and say these people are closer to the Earth than we are.
Well, indigenous people are neither sentimental
nor weakened by nostalgia.
There's not a lot of room for either
in the malarial swamps of the Asmat
or in the chilling winds of Tibet, but they have, nevertheless,
through time and ritual, forged a traditional mystique of the Earth
that is based not on the idea of being self-consciously close to it,
but on a far subtler intuition:
the idea that the Earth itself can only exist
because it is breathed into being by human consciousness.
Now, what does that mean?
It means that a young kid from the Andes
who's raised to believe that that mountain is an Apu spirit
that will direct his or her destiny
will be a profoundly different human being
and have a different relationship to that resource
or that place than a young kid from Montana
raised to believe that a mountain is a pile of rock
ready to be mined.
Whether it's the abode of a spirit or a pile of ore is irrelevant.
What's interesting is the metaphor that defines the relationship
between the individual and the natural world.
I was raised in the forests of British Columbia
to believe those forests existed to be cut.
That made me a different human being
than my friends amongst the Kwagiulth
who believe that those forests were the abode of Huxwhukw
and the Crooked Beak of Heaven
and the cannibal spirits that dwelled at the north end of the world,
spirits they would have to engage during their Hamatsa initiation.
Now, if you begin to look at the idea
that these cultures could create different realities,
you could begin to understand
some of their extraordinary discoveries. Take this plant here.
It's a photograph I took in the Northwest Amazon just last April.
This is ayahuasca, which many of you have heard about,
the most powerful psychoactive preparation
of the shaman's repertoire.
What makes ayahuasca fascinating
is not the sheer pharmacological potential of this preparation,
but the elaboration of it. It's made really of two different sources:
on the one hand, this woody liana
which has in it a series of beta-carbolines,
harmine, harmaline, mildly hallucinogenic --
to take the vine alone
is rather to have sort of blue hazy smoke
drift across your consciousness --
but it's mixed with the leaves of a shrub in the coffee family
called Psychotria viridis.
This plant had in it some very powerful tryptamines,
very close to brain serotonin, dimethyltryptamine,
5-methoxydimethyltryptamine.
If you've ever seen the Yanomami
blowing that snuff up their noses,
that substance they make from a different set of species
also contains methoxydimethyltryptamine.
To have that powder blown up your nose
is rather like being shot out of a rifle barrel
lined with baroque paintings and landing on a sea of electricity. (Laughter)
It doesn't create the distortion of reality;
it creates the dissolution of reality.
In fact, I used to argue with my professor, Richard Evan Shultes --
who is a man who sparked the psychedelic era
with his discovery of the magic mushrooms
in Mexico in the 1930s --
I used to argue that you couldn't classify these tryptamines
as hallucinogenic because by the time you're under the effects
there's no one home anymore to experience a hallucination. (Laughter)
But the thing about tryptamines is they cannot be taken orally
because they're denatured by an enzyme
found naturally in the human gut called monoamine oxidase.
They can only be taken orally if taken in conjunction
with some other chemical that denatures the MAO.
Now, the fascinating things
are that the beta-carbolines found within that liana
are MAO inhibitors of the precise sort necessary
to potentiate the tryptamine. So you ask yourself a question.
How, in a flora of 80,000 species of vascular plants,
do these people find these two morphologically unrelated plants
that when combined in this way,
created a kind of biochemical version
of the whole being greater than the sum of the parts?
Well, we use that great euphemism, "trial and error,"
which is exposed to be meaningless.
But you ask the Indians, and they say, "The plants talk to us."
Well, what does that mean?
This tribe, the Cofan, has 17 varieties of ayahuasca,
all of which they distinguish a great distance in the forest,
all of which are referable to our eye as one species.
And then you ask them how they establish their taxonomy
and they say, "I thought you knew something about plants.
I mean, don't you know anything?" And I said, "No."
Well, it turns out you take each of the 17 varieties
in the night of a full moon, and it sings to you in a different key.
Now, that's not going to get you a Ph.D. at Harvard,
but it's a lot more interesting than counting stamens. (Laughter)
Now --
(Applause) --
the problem -- the problem is that even those of us
sympathetic with the plight of indigenous people
view them as quaint and colorful
but somehow reduced to the margins of history
as the real world, meaning our world, moves on.
Well, the truth is the 20th century, 300 years from now,
is not going to be remembered for its wars
or its technological innovations,
but rather as the era in which we stood by
and either actively endorsed or passively accepted
the massive destruction of both biological and cultural diversity
on the planet. Now, the problem isn't change.
All cultures through all time
have constantly been engaged in a dance
with new possibilities of life.
And the problem is not technology itself.
The Sioux Indians did not stop being Sioux
when they gave up the bow and arrow
any more than an American stopped being an American
when he gave up the horse and buggy.
It's not change or technology
that threatens the integrity of the ethnosphere. It is power,
the crude face of domination.
Wherever you look around the world,
you discover that these are not cultures destined to fade away;
these are dynamic living peoples
being driven out of existence by identifiable forces
that are beyond their capacity to adapt to:
whether it's the egregious deforestation
in the homeland of the Penan --
a nomadic people from Southeast Asia, from Sarawak --
a people who lived free in the forest until a generation ago,
and now have all been reduced to servitude and prostitution
on the banks of the rivers,
where you can see the river itself is soiled with the silt
that seems to be carrying half of Borneo away
to the South China Sea,
where the Japanese freighters hang light in the horizon
ready to fill their holds with raw logs ripped from the forest --
or, in the case of the Yanomami,
it's the disease entities that have come in,
in the wake of the discovery of gold.
Or if we go into the mountains of Tibet,
where I'm doing a lot of research recently,
you'll see it's a crude face of political domination.
You know, genocide, the physical extinction of a people
is universally condemned, but ethnocide,
the destruction of people's way of life, is not only not condemned,
it's universally, in many quarters, celebrated
as part of a development strategy.
And you cannot understand the pain of Tibet
until you move through it at the ground level.
I once travelled 6,000 miles from Chengdu in Western China
overland through southeastern Tibet to Lhasa
with a young colleague, and it was only when I got to Lhasa
that I understood the face behind the statistics
you hear about:
6,000 sacred monuments torn apart to dust and ashes,
1.2 million people killed by the cadres
during the Cultural Revolution.
This young man's father had been ascribed to the Panchen Lama.
That meant he was instantly killed
at the time of the Chinese invasion.
His uncle fled with His Holiness in the Diaspora
that took the people to Nepal.
His mother was incarcerated
for the crime of being wealthy.
He was smuggled into the jail at the age of two
to hide beneath her skirt tails
because she couldn't bear to be without him.
The sister who had done that brave deed
was put into an education camp.
One day she inadvertently stepped on an armband
of Mao, and for that transgression,
she was given seven years of hard labor.
The pain of Tibet can be impossible to bear,
but the redemptive spirit of the people is something to behold.
And in the end, then, it really comes down to a choice:
do we want to live in a monochromatic world of monotony
or do we want to embrace a polychromatic world of diversity?
Margaret Mead, the great anthropologist, said, before she died,
that her greatest fear was that as we drifted towards
this blandly amorphous generic world view
not only would we see the entire range of the human imagination
reduced to a more narrow modality of thought,
but that we would wake from a dream one day
having forgotten there were even other possibilities.
And it's humbling to remember that our species has, perhaps,
been around for [150,000] years.
The Neolithic Revolution -- which gave us agriculture,
at which time we succumbed to the cult of the seed;
the poetry of the shaman was displaced
by the prose of the priesthood;
we created hierarchy specialization surplus --
is only 10,000 years ago.
The modern industrial world as we know it
is barely 300 years old.
Now, that shallow history doesn't suggest to me
that we have all the answers for all of the challenges
that will confront us in the ensuing millennia.
When these myriad cultures of the world
are asked the meaning of being human,
they respond with 10,000 different voices.
And it's within that song that we will all rediscover the possibility
of being what we are: a fully conscious species,
fully aware of ensuring that all peoples and all gardens
find a way to flourish. And there are great moments of optimism.
This is a photograph I took at the northern tip of Baffin Island
when I went narwhal hunting with some Inuit people,
and this man, Olayuk, told me a marvelous story of his grandfather.
The Canadian government has not always been kind
to the Inuit people, and during the 1950s,
to establish our sovereignty, we forced them into settlements.
This old man's grandfather refused to go.
The family, fearful for his life, took away all of his weapons,
all of his tools.
Now, you must understand that the Inuit did not fear the cold;
they took advantage of it.
The runners of their sleds were originally made of fish
wrapped in caribou hide.
So, this man's grandfather was not intimidated by the Arctic night
or the blizzard that was blowing.
He simply slipped outside, pulled down his sealskin trousers
and defecated into his hand. And as the feces began to freeze,
he shaped it into the form of a blade.
He put a spray of saliva on the edge of the shit knife
and as it finally froze solid, he butchered a dog with it.
He skinned the dog and improvised a harness,
took the ribcage of the dog and improvised a sled,
harnessed up an adjacent dog,
and disappeared over the ice floes, shit knife in belt.
Talk about getting by with nothing. (Laughter)
And this, in many ways --
(Applause) --
is a symbol of the resilience of the Inuit people
and of all indigenous people around the world.
The Canadian government in April of 1999
gave back to total control of the Inuit
an area of land larger than California and Texas put together.
It's our new homeland. It's called Nunavut.
It's an independent territory. They control all mineral resources.
An amazing example of how a nation-state
can seek restitution with its people.
And finally, in the end, I think it's pretty obvious
at least to all of all us who've traveled
in these remote reaches of the planet,
to realize that they're not remote at all.
They're homelands of somebody.
They represent branches of the human imagination
that go back to the dawn of time. And for all of us,
the dreams of these children, like the dreams of our own children,
become part of the naked geography of hope.
So, what we're trying to do at the National Geographic, finally,
is, we believe that politicians will never accomplish anything.
We think that polemics --
(Applause) --
we think that polemics are not persuasive,
but we think that storytelling can change the world,
and so we are probably the best storytelling institution
in the world. We get 35 million hits on our website every month.
156 nations carry our television channel.
Our magazines are read by millions.
And what we're doing is a series of journeys
to the ethnosphere where we're going to take our audience
to places of such cultural wonder
that they cannot help but come away dazzled
by what they have seen, and hopefully, therefore,
embrace gradually, one by one,
the central revelation of anthropology:
that this world deserves to exist in a diverse way,
that we can find a way to live
in a truly multicultural, pluralistic world
where all of the wisdom of all peoples
can contribute to our collective well-being.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
So the first robot
to talk about is called STriDER.
It stands for Self-excited
Tripedal Dynamic Experimental Robot.
It's a robot that has three legs,
which is inspired by nature.
But have you seen anything in nature,
an animal that has three legs?
Probably not. So why do I call this
a biologically inspired robot?
How would it work?
But before that,
let's look at pop culture.
So, you know H.G. Wells's
"War of the Worlds," novel and movie.
And what you see over here
is a very popular video game,
and in this fiction, they describe
these alien creatures and robots
that have three legs that terrorize Earth.
But my robot, STriDER,
does not move like this.
This is an actual dynamic
simulation animation.
I'm going to show you how the robot works.
It flips its body 180 degrees
and it swings its leg between the two legs
and catches the fall.
So that's how it walks.
But when you look at us
human beings, bipedal walking,
what you're doing is,
you're not really using muscle
to lift your leg and walk like a robot.
What you're doing is,
you swing your leg and catch the fall,
stand up again, swing your leg
and catch the fall.
You're using your built-in dynamics,
the physics of your body,
just like a pendulum.
We call that the concept
of passive dynamic locomotion.
What you're doing is, when you stand up,
potential energy to kinetic energy,
potential energy to kinetic energy.
It's a constantly falling process.
So even though there is nothing
in nature that looks like this,
really, we're inspired by biology
and applying the principles of walking
to this robot.
Thus, it's a biologically inspired robot.
What you see here,
this is what we want to do next.
We want to fold up the legs
and shoot it up for long-range motion.
And it deploys legs --
it looks almost like "Star Wars" --
so when it lands, it absorbs
the shock and starts walking.
What you see over here, this yellow thing,
this is not a death ray.
(Laughter)
This is just to show you
that if you have cameras
or different types of sensors,
because it's 1.8 meters tall,
you can see over obstacles like bushes
and those kinds of things.
So we have two prototypes.
The first version,
in the back, that's STriDER I.
The one in front,
the smaller, is STriDER II.
The problem we had with STriDER I is,
it was just too heavy in the body.
We had so many motors aligning the joints
and those kinds of things.
So we decided to synthesize
a mechanical mechanism
so we could get rid of all the motors,
and with a single motor,
we can coordinate all the motions.
It's a mechanical solution to a problem,
instead of using mechatronics.
So with this, now the top body
is lighted up; it's walking in our lab.
This was the very first successful step.
It's still not perfected,
its coffee falls down,
so we still have a lot of work to do.
The second robot I want
to talk about is called IMPASS.
It stands for Intelligent Mobility
Platform with Actuated Spoke System.
It's a wheel-leg hybrid robot.
So think of a rimless wheel
or a spoke wheel,
but the spokes individually
move in and out of the hub;
so, it's a wheel-leg hybrid.
We're literally reinventing
the wheel here.
Let me demonstrate how it works.
So in this video we're using an approach
called the reactive approach.
Just simply using
the tactile sensors on the feet,
it's trying to walk
over a changing terrain,
a soft terrain where it pushes
down and changes.
And just by the tactile information,
it successfully crosses
over these types of terrains.
But, when it encounters
a very extreme terrain --
in this case, this obstacle
is more than three times the height
of the robot --
then it switches to a deliberate mode,
where it uses a laser range finder
and camera systems
to identify the obstacle and the size.
And it carefully plans
the motion of the spokes
and coordinates it so it can show
this very impressive mobility.
You probably haven't seen
anything like this out there.
This is a very high-mobility robot
that we developed called IMPASS.
Ah, isn't that cool?
When you drive your car,
when you steer your car, you use
a method called Ackermann steering.
The front wheels rotate like this.
For most small-wheeled robots,
they use a method
called differential steering
where the left and right wheel
turn the opposite direction.
For IMPASS, we can do many,
many different types of motion.
For example, in this case,
even though the left and right
wheels are connected
with a single axle rotating
at the same angle of velocity,
we simply change the length
of the spoke, it affects the diameter,
then can turn to the left
and to the right.
These are just some examples
of the neat things we can do with IMPASS.
This robot is called CLIMBeR:
Cable-suspended Limbed Intelligent
Matching Behavior Robot.
I've been talking
to a lot of NASA JPL scientists --
at JPL, they are famous
for the Mars rovers --
and the scientists,
geologists always tell me
that the real interesting science,
the science-rich sites,
are always at the cliffs.
But the current rovers cannot get there.
So, inspired by that,
we wanted to build a robot
that can climb
a structured cliff environment.
So this is CLIMBeR.
It has three legs.
It's probably difficult to see, but it has
a winch and a cable at the top.
It tries to figure out
the best place to put its foot.
And then once it figures that out,
in real time, it calculates
the force distribution:
how much force it needs
to exert to the surface
so it doesn't tip and doesn't slip.
Once it stabilizes that, it lifts a foot,
and then with the winch,
it can climb up these kinds of cliffs.
Also for search and rescue
applications as well.
Five years ago,
I actually worked at NASA JPL
during the summer as a faculty fellow.
And they already had
a six-legged robot called LEMUR.
So this is actually based on that.
This robot is called MARS:
Multi-Appendage Robotic System.
It's a hexapod robot.
We developed our adaptive gait planner.
We actually have a very interesting
payload on there.
The students like to have fun.
And here you can see that it's walking
over unstructured terrain.
(Motor sound)
It's trying to walk
on the coastal terrain, a sandy area,
but depending on the moisture content
or the grain size of the sand,
the foot's soil sinkage model changes,
so it tries to adapt its gait
to successfully cross
over these kind of things.
It also does some fun stuff.
As you can imagine,
we get so many visitors visiting our lab.
So when the visitors come,
MARS walks up to the computer,
starts typing, "Hello, my name is MARS.
Welcome to RoMeLa,
the Robotics Mechanisms
Laboratory at Virginia Tech."
(Laughter)
This robot is an amoeba robot.
Now, we don't have enough time
to go into technical details,
I'll just show you
some of the experiments.
These are some of the early
feasibility experiments.
We store potential energy
to the elastic skin to make it move,
or use active tension cords
to make it move forward and backward.
It's called ChIMERA.
We also have been working
with some scientists and engineers
from UPenn
to come up with a chemically actuated
version of this amoeba robot.
We do something to something,
and just like magic, it moves.
"The Blob."
This robot is a very recent project.
It's called RAPHaEL:
Robotic Air-Powered Hand
with Elastic Ligaments.
There are a lot of really neat,
very good robotic hands
out there on the market.
The problem is,
they're just too expensive --
tens of thousands of dollars.
So for prosthesis applications
it's probably not too practical,
because it's not affordable.
We wanted to tackle this problem
in a very different direction.
Instead of using electrical motors,
electromechanical actuators,
we're using compressed air.
We developed these novel actuators
for the joints, so it's compliant.
You can actually change the force,
simply just changing the air pressure.
And it can actually crush
an empty soda can.
It can pick up very delicate
objects like a raw egg,
or in this case, a lightbulb.
The best part: it took only 200 dollars
to make the first prototype.
This robot is actually
a family of snake robots
that we call HyDRAS,
Hyper Degrees-of-freedom Robotic
Articulated Serpentine.
This is a robot that can climb structures.
This is a HyDRAS's arm.
It's a 12-degrees-of-freedom robotic arm.
But the cool part is the user interface.
The cable over there,
that's an optical fiber.
This student, it's probably
her first time using it,
but she can articulate it
in many different ways.
So, for example, in Iraq, the war zone,
there are roadside bombs.
Currently, you send these remotely
controlled vehicles that are armed.
It takes really a lot of time
and it's expensive to train the operator
to operate this complex arm.
In this case, it's very intuitive;
this student, probably
his first time using it,
is doing very complex manipulation tasks,
picking up objects and doing
manipulation, just like that.
Very intuitive.
Now, this robot
is currently our star robot.
We actually have a fan club
for the robot, DARwIn:
Dynamic Anthropomorphic
Robot with Intelligence.
As you know, we're very interested
in human walking,
so we decided to build
a small humanoid robot.
This was in 2004; at that time,
this was something really,
really revolutionary.
This was more of a feasibility study:
What kind of motors should we use?
Is it even possible?
What kinds of controls should we do?
This does not have any sensors,
so it's an open-loop control.
For those who probably know,
if you don't have any sensors
and there's any disturbances,
you know what happens.
(Laughter)
Based on that success, the following year
we did the proper mechanical design,
starting from kinematics.
And thus, DARwIn I was born in 2005.
It stands up, it walks -- very impressive.
However, still, as you can see,
it has a cord, an umbilical cord.
So we're still using
an external power source
and external computation.
So in 2006, now it's really
time to have fun.
Let's give it intelligence.
We give it all the computing
power it needs:
a 1.5 gigahertz Pentium M chip,
two FireWire cameras,
rate gyros, accelerometers,
four forced sensors on the foot,
lithium polymer batteries --
and now DARwIn II
is completely autonomous.
It is not remote controlled.
There's no tethers.
It looks around, searches for the ball ...
looks around, searches for the ball,
and it tries to play a game of soccer
autonomously -- artificial intelligence.
Let's see how it does.
This was our very first trial, and ...
(Video) Spectators: Goal!
Dennis Hong: There is actually
a competition called RoboCup.
I don't know how many of you
have heard about RoboCup.
It's an international autonomous
robot soccer competition.
And the actual goal of RoboCup is,
by the year 2050,
we want to have full-size,
autonomous humanoid robots
play soccer against the human
World Cup champions
and win.
(Laughter)
It's a true, actual goal.
It's a very ambitious goal,
but we truly believe we can do it.
This is last year in China.
We were the very first team
in the United States that qualified
in the humanoid RoboCup competition.
This is this year in Austria.
You're going to see the action
is three against three,
completely autonomous.
(Video) (Crowd groans)
DH: There you go. Yes!
The robots track and they team-play
amongst themselves.
It's very impressive.
It's really a research event,
packaged in a more exciting
competition event.
What you see here is the beautiful
Louis Vuitton Cup trophy.
This is for the best humanoid.
We'd like to bring this, for the first
time, to the United States next year,
so wish us luck.
(Applause)
Thank you.
(Applause)
DARwIn also has a lot of other talents.
Last year, it actually conducted
the Roanoke Symphony Orchestra
for the holiday concert.
This is the next generation
robot, DARwIn IV,
much smarter, faster, stronger.
And it's trying to show off its ability:
"I'm macho, I'm strong."
(Laughter)
"I can also do some Jackie Chan-motion,
martial art movements."
(Laughter)
And it walks away. So this is DARwIn IV.
Again, you'll be able
to see it in the lobby.
We truly believe this will be
the very first running humanoid robot
in the United States.
So stay tuned.
All right. So I showed you
some of our exciting robots at work.
So, what is the secret of our success?
Where do we come up with these ideas?
How do we develop these kinds of ideas?
We have a fully autonomous vehicle
that can drive into urban environments.
We won a half a million dollars
in the DARPA Urban Challenge.
We also have the world's very first
vehicle that can be driven by the blind.
We call it the Blind Driver
Challenge, very exciting.
And many, many other robotics
projects I want to talk about.
These are just the awards
that we won in 2007 fall
from robotics competitions
and those kinds of things.
So really, we have five secrets.
First is: Where do we get inspiration?
Where do we get this spark of imagination?
This is a true story, my personal story.
At night, when I go to bed,
at three, four in the morning,
I lie down, close my eyes,
and I see these lines and circles
and different shapes floating around.
And they assemble, and they form
these kinds of mechanisms.
And I think, "Ah, this is cool."
So right next to my bed
I keep a notebook, a journal,
with a special pen
that has an LED light on it,
because I don't want to turn on the light
and wake up my wife.
So I see this, scribble everything down,
draw things, and go to bed.
Every day in the morning,
the first thing I do,
before my first cup of coffee,
before I brush my teeth,
I open my notebook.
Many times it's empty;
sometimes I have something there.
If something's there, sometimes it's junk.
But most of the time,
I can't read my handwriting.
Four in the morning --
what do you expect, right?
So I need to decipher what I wrote.
But sometimes I see
this ingenious idea in there,
and I have this eureka moment.
I directly run to my home office,
sit at my computer,
I type in the ideas, I sketch things out
and I keep a database of ideas.
So when we have these calls for proposals,
I try to find a match
between my potential ideas
and the problem.
If there's a match,
we write a research proposal,
get the research funding in,
and that's how we start
our research programs.
But just a spark of imagination
is not good enough.
How do we develop these kinds of ideas?
At our lab RoMeLa, the Robotics
and Mechanisms Laboratory,
we have these fantastic
brainstorming sessions.
So we gather around, we discuss problems
and solutions and talk about it.
But before we start,
we set this golden rule.
The rule is:
nobody criticizes anybody's ideas.
Nobody criticizes any opinion.
This is important, because many times,
students fear or feel uncomfortable
about how others might think
about their opinions and thoughts.
So once you do this, it is amazing
how the students open up.
They have these wacky, cool,
crazy, brilliant ideas,
and the whole room is just electrified
with creative energy.
And this is how we develop our ideas.
Well, we're running out of time.
One more thing I want to talk about is,
you know, just a spark of idea
and development is not good enough.
There was a great TED moment --
I think it was Sir Ken Robinson, was it?
He gave a talk about how education
and school kill creativity.
Well, actually,
there's two sides to the story.
So there is only so much one can do
with just ingenious ideas
and creativity
and good engineering intuition.
If you want to go beyond a tinkering,
if you want to go
beyond a hobby of robotics
and really tackle
the grand challenges of robotics
through rigorous research,
we need more than that.
This is where school comes in.
Batman, fighting against the bad guys,
he has his utility belt,
he has his grappling hook,
he has all different kinds of gadgets.
For us roboticists,
engineers and scientists,
these tools are the courses
and classes you take in class.
Math, differential equations.
I have linear algebra, science, physics --
even, nowadays, chemistry
and biology, as you've seen.
These are all the tools we need.
So the more tools you have, for Batman,
more effective at fighting the bad guys,
for us, more tools to attack
these kinds of big problems.
So education is very important.
Also -- it's not only about that.
You also have to work really, really hard.
So I always tell my students,
"Work smart, then work hard."
This picture in the back --
this is three in the morning.
I guarantee if you come
to our lab at 3, 4am,
we have students working there,
not because I tell them to,
but because we are having too much fun.
Which leads to the last topic:
do not forget to have fun.
That's really the secret of our success,
we're having too much fun.
I truly believe that highest productivity
comes when you're having fun,
and that's what we're doing.
And there you go.
Thank you so much.
(Applause)
Well, that's kind of an obvious statement up there.
I started with that sentence about 12 years ago,
and I started in the context
of developing countries,
but you're sitting here from every corner of the world.
So if you think of a map of your country,
I think you'll realize
that for every country on Earth,
you could draw little circles to say,
"These are places where good teachers won't go."
On top of that,
those are the places from where trouble comes.
So we have an ironic problem --
good teachers don't want to go
to just those places where they're needed the most.
I started in 1999
to try and address this problem with an experiment,
which was a very simple experiment in New Delhi.
I basically embedded a computer
into a wall of a slum in New Delhi.
The children barely went to school, they didn't know any English --
they'd never seen a computer before,
and they didn't know what the internet was.
I connected high speed internet to it -- it's about three feet off the ground --
turned it on and left it there.
After this,
we noticed a couple of interesting things, which you'll see.
But I repeated this all over India
and then through
a large part of the world
and noticed
that children will learn to do
what they want to learn to do.
This is the first experiment that we did --
eight year-old boy on your right
teaching his student, a six year-old girl,
and he was teaching her how to browse.
This boy here in the middle of central India --
this is in a Rajasthan village,
where the children recorded their own music
and then played it back to each other
and in the process,
they've enjoyed themselves thoroughly.
They did all of this in four hours
after seeing the computer for the first time.
In another South Indian village,
these boys here
had assembled a video camera
and were trying to take the photograph of a bumble bee.
They downloaded it from Disney.com,
or one of these websites,
14 days after putting the computer in their village.
So at the end of it,
we concluded that groups of children
can learn to use computers and the internet on their own,
irrespective of who
or where they were.
At that point, I became a little more ambitious
and decided to see
what else could children do with a computer.
We started off with an experiment in Hyderabad, India,
where I gave a group of children --
they spoke English with a very strong Telugu accent.
I gave them a computer
with a speech-to-text interface,
which you now get free with Windows,
and asked them to speak into it.
So when they spoke into it,
the computer typed out gibberish,
so they said, "Well, it doesn't understand anything of what we are saying."
So I said, "Yeah, I'll leave it here for two months.
Make yourself understood
to the computer."
So the children said, "How do we do that."
And I said,
"I don't know, actually."
(Laughter)
And I left.
(Laughter)
Two months later --
and this is now documented
in the Information Technology
for International Development journal --
that accents had changed
and were remarkably close to the neutral British accent
in which I had trained the speech-to-text synthesizer.
In other words, they were all speaking like James Tooley.
(Laughter)
So they could do that on their own.
After that, I started to experiment
with various other things
that they might learn to do on their own.
I got an interesting phone call once from Columbo,
from the late Arthur C. Clarke,
who said, "I want to see what's going on."
And he couldn't travel, so I went over there.
He said two interesting things,
"A teacher that can be replaced by a machine should be."
(Laughter)
The second thing he said was that,
"If children have interest,
then education happens."
And I was doing that in the field,
so every time I would watch it and think of him.
(Video) Arthur C. Clarke: And they can definitely
help people,
because children quickly learn to navigate
the web and find things which interest them.
And when you've got interest, then you have education.
Sugata Mitra: I took the experiment to South Africa.
This is a 15 year-old boy.
(Video) Boy: ... just mention, I play games
like animals,
and I listen to music.
SM: And I asked him, "Do you send emails?"
And he said, "Yes, and they hop across the ocean."
This is in Cambodia,
rural Cambodia --
a fairly silly arithmetic game,
which no child would play inside the classroom or at home.
They would, you know, throw it back at you.
They'd say, "This is very boring."
If you leave it on the pavement
and if all the adults go away,
then they will show off with each other
about what they can do.
This is what these children are doing.
They are trying to multiply, I think.
And all over India,
at the end of about two years,
children were beginning to Google their homework.
As a result, the teachers reported
tremendous improvements in their English --
(Laughter)
rapid improvement and all sorts of things.
They said, "They have become really deep thinkers and so on and so forth.
(Laughter)
And indeed they had.
I mean, if there's stuff on Google,
why would you need to stuff it into your head?
So at the end of the next four years,
I decided that groups of children can navigate the internet
to achieve educational objectives on their own.
At that time, a large amount of money
had come into Newcastle University
to improve schooling in India.
So Newcastle gave me a call. I said, "I'll do it from Delhi."
They said, "There's no way you're going to handle
a million pounds-worth of University money
sitting in Delhi."
So in 2006,
I bought myself a heavy overcoat
and moved to Newcastle.
I wanted to test the limits
of the system.
The first experiment I did out of Newcastle
was actually done in India.
And I set myself and impossible target:
can Tamil speaking
12-year-old children
in a South Indian village
teach themselves biotechnology
in English on their own?
And I thought, I'll test them, they'll get a zero --
I'll give the materials, I'll come back and test them --
they get another zero,
I'll go back and say, "Yes, we need teachers for certain things."
I called in 26 children.
They all came in there, and I told them
that there's some really difficult stuff on this computer.
I wouldn't be surprised if you didn't understand anything.
It's all in English, and I'm going.
(Laughter)
So I left them with it.
I came back after two months,
and the 26 children marched in looking very, very quiet.
I said, "Well, did you look at any of the stuff?"
They said, "Yes, we did."
"Did you understand anything?" "No, nothing."
So I said,
"Well, how long did you practice on it
before you decided you understood nothing?"
They said, "We look at it every day."
So I said, "For two months, you were looking at stuff you didn't understand?"
So a 12 year-old girl raises her hand and says,
literally,
"Apart from the fact that improper replication of the DNA molecule
causes genetic disease,
we've understood nothing else."
(Laughter)
(Applause)
(Laughter)
It took me three years to publish that.
It's just been published in the British Journal of Educational Technology.
One of the referees who refereed the paper said,
"It's too good to be true,"
which was not very nice.
Well, one of the girls had taught herself
to become the teacher.
And then that's her over there.
Remember, they don't study English.
I edited out the last bit when I asked, "Where is the neuron?"
and she says, "The neuron? The neuron,"
and then she looked and did this.
Whatever the expression, it was not very nice.
So their scores had gone up from zero to 30 percent,
which is an educational impossibility under the circumstances.
But 30 percent is not a pass.
So I found that they had a friend,
a local accountant, a young girl,
and they played football with her.
I asked that girl, "Would you teach them
enough biotechnology to pass?"
And she said, "How would I do that? I don't know the subject."
I said, "No, use the method of the grandmother."
She said, "What's that?"
I said, "Well, what you've got to do
is stand behind them
and admire them all the time.
Just say to them, 'That's cool. That's fantastic.
What is that? Can you do that again? Can you show me some more?'"
She did that for two months.
The scores went up to 50,
which is what the posh schools of New Delhi,
with a trained biotechnology teacher were getting.
So I came back to Newcastle
with these results
and decided
that there was something happening here
that definitely was getting very serious.
So, having experimented in all sorts of remote places,
I came to the most remote place that I could think of.
(Laughter)
Approximately 5,000 miles from Delhi
is the little town of Gateshead.
In Gateshead, I took 32 children
and I started to fine-tune the method.
I made them into groups of four.
I said, "You make your own groups of four.
Each group of four can use one computer and not four computers."
Remember, from the Hole in the Wall.
"You can exchange groups.
You can walk across to another group,
if you don't like your group, etc.
You can go to another group, peer over their shoulders, see what they're doing,
come back to you own group and claim it as your own work."
And I explained to them
that, you know, a lot of scientific research is done using that method.
(Laughter)
(Applause)
The children enthusiastically got after me and said,
"Now, what do you want us to do?"
I gave them six GCSE questions.
The first group -- the best one --
solved everything in 20 minutes.
The worst, in 45.
They used everything that they knew --
news groups, Google, Wikipedia,
Ask Jeeves, etc.
The teachers said, "Is this deep learning?"
I said, "Well, let's try it.
I'll come back after two months.
We'll give them a paper test --
no computers, no talking to each other, etc."
The average score when I'd done it with the computers and the groups
was 76 percent.
When I did the experiment, when I did the test,
after two months, the score
was 76 percent.
There was photographic recall
inside the children,
I suspect because they're discussing with each other.
A single child in front of a single computer
will not do that.
I have further results,
which are almost unbelievable,
of scores which go up with time.
Because their teachers say
that after the session is over,
the children continue to Google further.
Here in Britain, I put out a call
for British grandmothers,
after my Kuppam experiment.
Well, you know,
they're very vigorous people, British grandmothers.
200 of them volunteered immediately.
(Laughter)
The deal was that they would give me
one hour of broadband time,
sitting in their homes,
one day in a week.
So they did that,
and over the last two years,
over 600 hours of instruction
has happened over Skype,
using what my students call the granny cloud.
The granny cloud sits over there.
I can beam them to whichever school I want to.
(Video) Teacher: You can't catch me.
You say it.
You can't catch me.
Children: You can't catch me.
Teacher: I'm the gingerbread man.
Children: I'm the gingerbread man.
Teacher: Well done. Very good ...
SM: Back at Gateshead,
a 10-year-old girl gets into the heart of Hinduism
in 15 minutes.
You know, stuff which I don't know anything about.
Two children watch a TEDTalk.
They wanted to be footballers before.
After watching eight TEDTalks,
he wants to become Leonardo da Vinci.
(Laughter)
(Applause)
It's pretty simple stuff.
This is what I'm building now --
they're called SOLEs: Self Organized Learning Environments.
The furniture is designed
so that children can sit in front of big, powerful screens,
big broadband connections, but in groups.
If they want, they can call the granny cloud.
This is a SOLE in Newcastle.
The mediator is from Pune, India.
So how far can we go? One last little bit and I'll stop.
I went to Turin in May.
I sent all the teachers away from my group of 10 year-old students.
I speak only English, they speak only Italian,
so we had no way to communicate.
I started writing English questions on the blackboard.
The children looked at it and said, "What?"
I said, "Well, do it."
They typed it into Google, translated it into Italian,
went back into Italian Google.
Fifteen minutes later --
next question: where is Calcutta?
This one, they took only 10 minutes.
I tried a really hard one then.
Who was Pythagoras, and what did he do?
There was silence for a while,
then they said, "You've spelled it wrong.
It's Pitagora."
And then,
in 20 minutes,
the right-angled triangles began to appear on the screens.
This sent shivers up my spine.
These are 10 year-olds.
Text: In another 30 minutes they would reach the Theory of Relativity. And then?
(Laughter)
(Applause)
SM: So you know what's happened?
I think we've just stumbled across
a self-organizing system.
A self-organizing system is one
where a structure appears
without explicit intervention from the outside.
Self-organizing systems also always show emergence,
which is that the system starts to do things,
which it was never designed for.
Which is why you react the way you do,
because it looks impossible.
I think I can make a guess now --
education is self-organizing system,
where learning is an emergent phenomenon.
It'll take a few years to prove it, experimentally,
but I'm going to try.
But in the meanwhile, there is a method available.
One billion children, we need 100 million mediators --
there are many more than that on the planet --
10 million SOLEs,
180 billion dollars and 10 years.
We could change everything.
Thanks.
(Applause)
When we park in a big parking lot,
how do we remember where we parked our car?
Here's the problem facing Homer.
And we're going to try to understand
what's happening in his brain.
So we'll start with the hippocampus, shown in yellow,
which is the organ of memory.
If you have damage there, like in Alzheimer's,
you can't remember things including where you parked your car.
It's named after Latin for "seahorse,"
which it resembles.
And like the rest of the brain, it's made of neurons.
So the human brain
has about a hundred billion neurons in it.
And the neurons communicate with each other
by sending little pulses or spikes of electricity
via connections to each other.
The hippocampus is formed of two sheets of cells,
which are very densely interconnected.
And scientists have begun to understand
how spatial memory works
by recording from individual neurons
in rats or mice
while they forage or explore an environment
looking for food.
So we're going to imagine we're recording from a single neuron
in the hippocampus of this rat here.
And when it fires a little spike of electricity,
there's going to be a red dot and a click.
So what we see
is that this neuron knows
whenever the rat has gone into one particular place in its environment.
And it signals to the rest of the brain
by sending a little electrical spike.
So we could show the firing rate of that neuron
as a function of the animal's location.
And if we record from lots of different neurons,
we'll see that different neurons fire
when the animal goes in different parts of its environment,
like in this square box shown here.
So together they form a map
for the rest of the brain,
telling the brain continually,
"Where am I now within my environment?"
Place cells are also being recorded in humans.
So epilepsy patients sometimes need
the electrical activity in their brain monitoring.
And some of these patients played a video game
where they drive around a small town.
And place cells in their hippocampi would fire, become active,
start sending electrical impulses
whenever they drove through a particular location in that town.
So how does a place cell know
where the rat or person is within its environment?
Well these two cells here
show us that the boundaries of the environment
are particularly important.
So the one on the top
likes to fire sort of midway between the walls
of the box that their rat's in.
And when you expand the box, the firing location expands.
The one below likes to fire
whenever there's a wall close by to the south.
And if you put another wall inside the box,
then the cell fires in both place
wherever there's a wall to the south
as the animal explores around in its box.
So this predicts
that sensing the distances and directions of boundaries around you --
extended buildings and so on --
is particularly important for the hippocampus.
And indeed, on the inputs to the hippocampus,
cells are found which project into the hippocampus,
which do respond exactly
to detecting boundaries or edges
at particular distances and directions
from the rat or mouse
as it's exploring around.
So the cell on the left, you can see,
it fires whenever the animal gets near
to a wall or a boundary to the east,
whether it's the edge or the wall of a square box
or the circular wall of the circular box
or even the drop at the edge of a table, which the animals are running around.
And the cell on the right there
fires whenever there's a boundary to the south,
whether it's the drop at the edge of the table or a wall
or even the gap between two tables that are pulled apart.
So that's one way in which we think
place cells determine where the animal is as it's exploring around.
We can also test where we think objects are,
like this goal flag, in simple environments --
or indeed, where your car would be.
So we can have people explore an environment
and see the location they have to remember.
And then, if we put them back in the environment,
generally they're quite good at putting a marker down
where they thought that flag or their car was.
But on some trials,
we could change the shape and size of the environment
like we did with the place cell.
In that case, we can see
how where they think the flag had been changes
as a function of how you change the shape and size of the environment.
And what you see, for example,
if the flag was where that cross was in a small square environment,
and then if you ask people where it was,
but you've made the environment bigger,
where they think the flag had been
stretches out in exactly the same way
that the place cell firing stretched out.
It's as if you remember where the flag was
by storing the pattern of firing across all of your place cells
at that location,
and then you can get back to that location
by moving around
so that you best match the current pattern of firing of your place cells
with that stored pattern.
That guides you back to the location that you want to remember.
But we also know where we are through movement.
So if we take some outbound path --
perhaps we park and we wander off --
we know because our own movements,
which we can integrate over this path
roughly what the heading direction is to go back.
And place cells also get this kind of path integration input
from a kind of cell called a grid cell.
Now grid cells are found, again,
on the inputs to the hippocampus,
and they're a bit like place cells.
But now as the rat explores around,
each individual cell fires
in a whole array of different locations
which are laid out across the environment
in an amazingly regular triangular grid.
And if you record from several grid cells --
shown here in different colors --
each one has a grid-like firing pattern across the environment,
and each cell's grid-like firing pattern is shifted slightly
relative to the other cells.
So the red one fires on this grid
and the green one on this one and the blue on on this one.
So together, it's as if the rat
can put a virtual grid of firing locations
across its environment --
a bit like the latitude and longitude lines that you'd find on a map,
but using triangles.
And as it moves around,
the electrical activity can pass
from one of these cells to the next cell
to keep track of where it is,
so that it can use its own movements
to know where it is in its environment.
Do people have grid cells?
Well because all of the grid-like firing patterns
have the same axes of symmetry,
the same orientations of grid, shown in orange here,
it means that the net activity
of all of the grid cells in a particular part of the brain
should change
according to whether we're running along these six directions
or running along one of the six directions in between.
So we can put people in an MRI scanner
and have them do a little video game
like the one I showed you
and look for this signal.
And indeed, you do see it in the human entorhinal cortex,
which is the same part of the brain that you see grid cells in rats.
So back to Homer.
He's probably remembering where his car was
in terms of the distances and directions
to extended buildings and boundaries
around the location where he parked.
And that would be represented
by the firing of boundary-detecting cells.
He's also remembering the path he took out of the car park,
which would be represented in the firing of grid cells.
Now both of these kinds of cells
can make the place cells fire.
And he can return to the location where he parked
by moving so as to find where it is
that best matches the firing pattern
of the place cells in his brain currently
with the stored pattern where he parked his car.
And that guides him back to that location
irrespective of visual cues
like whether his car's actually there.
Maybe it's been towed.
But he knows where it was, so he knows to go and get it.
So beyond spatial memory,
if we look for this grid-like firing pattern
throughout the whole brain,
we see it in a whole series of locations
which are always active
when we do all kinds of autobiographical memory tasks,
like remembering the last time you went to a wedding, for example.
So it may be that the neural mechanisms
for representing the space around us
are also used for generating visual imagery
so that we can recreate the spatial scene, at least,
of the events that have happened to us when we want to imagine them.
So if this was happening,
your memories could start by place cells activating each other
via these dense interconnections
and then reactivating boundary cells
to create the spatial structure
of the scene around your viewpoint.
And grid cells could move this viewpoint through that space.
Another kind of cell, head direction cells,
which I didn't mention yet,
they fire like a compass according to which way you're facing.
They could define the viewing direction
from which you want to generate an image for your visual imagery,
so you can imagine what happened when you were at this wedding, for example.
So this is just one example
of a new era really
in cognitive neuroscience
where we're beginning to understand
psychological processes
like how you remember or imagine or even think
in terms of the actions
of the billions of individual neurons that make up our brains.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
So, I'll start with this: a couple
years ago, an event planner called me
because I was going
to do a speaking event.
And she called, and she said,
"I'm really struggling with how
to write about you on the little flyer."
And I thought,
"Well, what's the struggle?"
And she said, "Well, I saw you speak,
and I'm going to call you
a researcher, I think,
but I'm afraid if I call you
a researcher, no one will come,
because they'll think
you're boring and irrelevant."
(Laughter)
And I was like, "Okay."
And she said, "But the thing
I liked about your talk
is you're a storyteller.
So I think what I'll do
is just call you a storyteller."
And of course, the academic,
insecure part of me
was like, "You're going
to call me a what?"
And she said, "I'm going
to call you a storyteller."
And I was like, "Why not 'magic pixie'?"
(Laughter)
I was like, "Let me think
about this for a second."
I tried to call deep on my courage.
And I thought, you know,
I am a storyteller.
I'm a qualitative researcher.
I collect stories; that's what I do.
And maybe stories
are just data with a soul.
And maybe I'm just a storyteller.
And so I said, "You know what?
Why don't you just say
I'm a researcher-storyteller."
And she went, "Ha ha.
There's no such thing."
(Laughter)
So I'm a researcher-storyteller,
and I'm going to talk to you today --
we're talking about
expanding perception --
and so I want to talk to you
and tell some stories
about a piece of my research
that fundamentally expanded my perception
and really actually changed
the way that I live and love
and work and parent.
And this is where my story starts.
When I was a young researcher,
doctoral student,
my first year, I had
a research professor who said to us,
"Here's the thing, if you cannot
measure it, it does not exist."
And I thought he was just
sweet-talking me.
I was like, "Really?"
and he was like, "Absolutely."
And so you have to understand
that I have a bachelor's
and a master's in social work,
and I was getting my Ph.D. in social work,
so my entire academic career
was surrounded by people who kind of
believed in the "life's messy, love it."
And I'm more of the, "life's messy,
clean it up, organize it
and put it into a bento box."
(Laughter)
And so to think that I had found my way,
to found a career that takes me --
really, one of the big sayings
in social work is,
"Lean into the discomfort of the work."
And I'm like, knock discomfort
upside the head
and move it over and get all A's.
That was my mantra.
So I was very excited about this.
And so I thought, you know what,
this is the career for me,
because I am interested
in some messy topics.
But I want to be able
to make them not messy.
I want to understand them.
I want to hack into these things
that I know are important
and lay the code out for everyone to see.
So where I started was with connection.
Because, by the time
you're a social worker for 10 years,
what you realize is that connection
is why we're here.
It's what gives purpose
and meaning to our lives.
This is what it's all about.
It doesn't matter whether
you talk to people
who work in social justice,
mental health and abuse and neglect,
what we know is that connection,
the ability to feel connected, is --
neurobiologically
that's how we're wired --
it's why we're here.
So I thought, you know what,
I'm going to start with connection.
Well, you know that situation
where you get an evaluation
from your boss,
and she tells you 37 things
that you do really awesome,
and one "opportunity for growth?"
(Laughter)
And all you can think about
is that opportunity for growth, right?
Well, apparently this is the way
my work went as well,
because, when you ask people about love,
they tell you about heartbreak.
When you ask people about belonging,
they'll tell you their most excruciating
experiences of being excluded.
And when you ask people about connection,
the stories they told me
were about disconnection.
So very quickly -- really about six weeks
into this research --
I ran into this unnamed thing
that absolutely unraveled connection
in a way that I didn't understand
or had never seen.
And so I pulled back out of the research
and thought, I need
to figure out what this is.
And it turned out to be shame.
And shame is really easily understood
as the fear of disconnection:
Is there something about me that,
if other people know it or see it,
that I won't be worthy of connection?
The things I can tell you about it:
It's universal; we all have it.
The only people who don't experience shame
have no capacity for human
empathy or connection.
No one wants to talk about it,
and the less you talk about it,
the more you have it.
What underpinned this shame,
this "I'm not good enough," --
which, we all know that feeling:
"I'm not blank enough.
I'm not thin enough,
rich enough, beautiful enough,
smart enough, promoted enough."
The thing that underpinned this
was excruciating vulnerability.
This idea of, in order
for connection to happen,
we have to allow ourselves
to be seen, really seen.
And you know how I feel
about vulnerability. I hate vulnerability.
And so I thought, this is my chance
to beat it back with my measuring stick.
I'm going in, I'm going
to figure this stuff out,
I'm going to spend a year,
I'm going to totally deconstruct shame,
I'm going to understand
how vulnerability works,
and I'm going to outsmart it.
So I was ready, and I was really excited.
As you know,
it's not going to turn out well.
(Laughter)
You know this.
So, I could tell you a lot about shame,
but I'd have to borrow
everyone else's time.
But here's what I can tell you
that it boils down to --
and this may be one of the most important
things that I've ever learned
in the decade of doing this research.
My one year turned into six years:
Thousands of stories, hundreds
of long interviews, focus groups.
At one point, people were
sending me journal pages
and sending me their stories --
thousands of pieces of data in six years.
And I kind of got a handle on it.
I kind of understood, this is
what shame is, this is how it works.
I wrote a book, I published a theory,
but something was not okay --
and what it was is that, if I roughly
took the people I interviewed
and divided them into people who really
have a sense of worthiness --
that's what this comes down to,
a sense of worthiness --
they have a strong sense
of love and belonging --
and folks who struggle for it,
and folks who are always wondering
if they're good enough.
There was only one variable that separated
the people who have a strong sense
of love and belonging
and the people who really struggle for it.
And that was, the people who have
a strong sense of love and belonging
believe they're worthy
of love and belonging.
That's it.
They believe they're worthy.
And to me, the hard part of the one thing
that keeps us out of connection
is our fear that we're not
worthy of connection,
was something that,
personally and professionally,
I felt like I needed to understand better.
So what I did is I took
all of the interviews
where I saw worthiness,
where I saw people living that way,
and just looked at those.
What do these people have in common?
I have a slight office supply addiction,
but that's another talk.
So I had a manila folder,
and I had a Sharpie,
and I was like, what am I going
to call this research?
And the first words that came
to my mind were "whole-hearted."
These are whole-hearted people,
living from this deep sense of worthiness.
So I wrote at the top
of the manila folder,
and I started looking at the data.
In fact, I did it first in a four-day,
very intensive data analysis,
where I went back, pulled the interviews,
the stories, pulled the incidents.
What's the theme? What's the pattern?
My husband left town with the kids
because I always go into this
Jackson Pollock crazy thing,
where I'm just writing
and in my researcher mode.
And so here's what I found.
What they had in common
was a sense of courage.
And I want to separate courage
and bravery for you for a minute.
Courage, the original
definition of courage,
when it first came
into the English language --
it's from the Latin word "cor,"
meaning "heart" --
and the original definition was to tell
the story of who you are
with your whole heart.
And so these folks had, very simply,
the courage to be imperfect.
They had the compassion to be kind
to themselves first and then to others,
because, as it turns out,
we can't practice compassion
with other people
if we can't treat ourselves kindly.
And the last was they had connection,
and -- this was the hard part --
as a result of authenticity,
they were willing to let go
of who they thought they should be
in order to be who they were,
which you have to absolutely do that
for connection.
The other thing that they had
in common was this:
They fully embraced vulnerability.
They believed that what made them
vulnerable made them beautiful.
They didn't talk about vulnerability
being comfortable,
nor did they really talk
about it being excruciating --
as I had heard it earlier
in the shame interviewing.
They just talked about it being necessary.
They talked about the willingness
to say, "I love you" first ...
the willingness to do something
where there are no guarantees ...
the willingness to breathe
through waiting for the doctor to call
after your mammogram.
They're willing to invest
in a relationship
that may or may not work out.
They thought this was fundamental.
I personally thought it was betrayal.
I could not believe I had pledged
allegiance to research, where our job --
you know, the definition of research
is to control and predict,
to study phenomena for the explicit
reason to control and predict.
And now my mission to control and predict
had turned up the answer
that the way to live is with vulnerability
and to stop controlling and predicting.
This led to a little breakdown --
(Laughter)
-- which actually looked more like this.
(Laughter)
And it did.
I call it a breakdown; my therapist
calls it a spiritual awakening.
(Laughter)
A spiritual awakening
sounds better than breakdown,
but I assure you, it was a breakdown.
And I had to put my data away
and go find a therapist.
Let me tell you something:
you know who you are
when you call your friends and say,
"I think I need to see somebody.
Do you have any recommendations?"
Because about five
of my friends were like,
"Wooo, I wouldn't want
to be your therapist."
(Laughter)
I was like, "What does that mean?"
And they're like,
"I'm just saying, you know.
Don't bring your measuring stick."
(Laughter)
I was like, "Okay."
So I found a therapist.
My first meeting with her, Diana --
I brought in my list of the way
the whole-hearted live, and I sat down.
And she said, "How are you?"
And I said, "I'm great. I'm okay."
She said, "What's going on?"
And this is a therapist
who sees therapists,
because we have to go to those,
because their B.S. meters are good.
(Laughter)
And so I said, "Here's the thing,
I'm struggling."
And she said, "What's the struggle?"
And I said, "Well, I have
a vulnerability issue.
And I know that vulnerability
is the core of shame and fear
and our struggle for worthiness,
but it appears that it's also
the birthplace of joy, of creativity,
of belonging, of love.
And I think I have a problem,
and I need some help."
And I said, "But here's the thing:
no family stuff, no childhood shit."
(Laughter)
"I just need some strategies."
(Laughter)
(Applause)
Thank you.
So she goes like this.
(Laughter)
And then I said, "It's bad, right?"
And she said, "It's neither good nor bad."
(Laughter)
"It just is what it is."
And I said, "Oh my God,
this is going to suck."
(Laughter)
And it did, and it didn't.
And it took about a year.
And you know how there are people
that, when they realize that vulnerability
and tenderness are important,
that they surrender and walk into it.
A: that's not me,
and B: I don't even hang out
with people like that.
(Laughter)
For me, it was a yearlong street fight.
It was a slugfest.
Vulnerability pushed, I pushed back.
I lost the fight,
but probably won my life back.
And so then I went back into the research
and spent the next couple of years
really trying to understand
what they, the whole-hearted,
what choices they were making,
and what we are doing with vulnerability.
Why do we struggle with it so much?
Am I alone in struggling
with vulnerability?
No.
So this is what I learned.
We numb vulnerability --
when we're waiting for the call.
It was funny, I sent something out
on Twitter and on Facebook
that says, "How would you
define vulnerability?
What makes you feel vulnerable?"
And within an hour and a half,
I had 150 responses.
Because I wanted to know what's out there.
Having to ask my husband for help
because I'm sick, and we're newly married;
initiating sex with my husband;
initiating sex with my wife;
being turned down; asking someone out;
waiting for the doctor to call back;
getting laid off; laying off people.
This is the world we live in.
We live in a vulnerable world.
And one of the ways we deal
with it is we numb vulnerability.
And I think there's evidence --
and it's not the only reason
this evidence exists,
but I think it's a huge cause --
We are the most in-debt ...
obese ...
addicted and medicated
adult cohort in U.S. history.
The problem is -- and I learned this
from the research --
that you cannot selectively numb emotion.
You can't say, here's the bad stuff.
Here's vulnerability,
here's grief, here's shame,
here's fear, here's disappointment.
I don't want to feel these.
I'm going to have a couple of beers
and a banana nut muffin.
(Laughter)
I don't want to feel these.
And I know that's knowing laughter.
I hack into your lives for a living.
God.
(Laughter)
You can't numb those hard feelings
without numbing
the other affects, our emotions.
You cannot selectively numb.
So when we numb those,
we numb joy,
we numb gratitude,
we numb happiness.
And then, we are miserable,
and we are looking
for purpose and meaning,
and then we feel vulnerable,
so then we have a couple of beers
and a banana nut muffin.
And it becomes this dangerous cycle.
One of the things that I think
we need to think about
is why and how we numb.
And it doesn't just have to be addiction.
The other thing we do is we make
everything that's uncertain certain.
Religion has gone from a belief
in faith and mystery to certainty.
"I'm right, you're wrong. Shut up."
That's it.
Just certain.
The more afraid we are,
the more vulnerable we are,
the more afraid we are.
This is what politics looks like today.
There's no discourse anymore.
There's no conversation.
There's just blame.
You know how blame
is described in the research?
A way to discharge pain and discomfort.
We perfect.
If there's anyone who wants their life
to look like this, it would be me,
but it doesn't work.
Because what we do is we take fat
from our butts and put it in our cheeks.
(Laughter)
Which just, I hope in 100 years,
people will look back and go, "Wow."
(Laughter)
And we perfect,
most dangerously, our children.
Let me tell you what we think
about children.
They're hardwired for struggle
when they get here.
And when you hold those perfect
little babies in your hand,
our job is not to say,
"Look at her, she's perfect.
My job is just to keep her perfect --
make sure she makes the tennis team
by fifth grade and Yale by seventh."
That's not our job.
Our job is to look and say,
"You know what? You're imperfect,
and you're wired for struggle,
but you are worthy of love and belonging."
That's our job.
Show me a generation
of kids raised like that,
and we'll end the problems,
I think, that we see today.
We pretend that what we do
doesn't have an effect on people.
We do that in our personal lives.
We do that corporate --
whether it's a bailout, an oil spill ...
a recall.
We pretend like what we're doing
doesn't have a huge impact
on other people.
I would say to companies,
this is not our first rodeo, people.
We just need you to be authentic
and real and say ...
"We're sorry. We'll fix it."
But there's another way,
and I'll leave you with this.
This is what I have found:
To let ourselves be seen,
deeply seen, vulnerably seen ...
to love with our whole hearts,
even though there's no guarantee --
and that's really hard,
and I can tell you as a parent,
that's excruciatingly difficult --
to practice gratitude and joy
in those moments of terror,
when we're wondering,
"Can I love you this much?
Can I believe in this this passionately?
Can I be this fierce about this?"
just to be able to stop and, instead of
catastrophizing what might happen,
to say, "I'm just so grateful,
because to feel this vulnerable
means I'm alive."
And the last, which I think
is probably the most important,
is to believe that we're enough.
Because when we work from a place,
I believe, that says, "I'm enough" ...
then we stop screaming
and start listening,
we're kinder and gentler
to the people around us,
and we're kinder and gentler to ourselves.
That's all I have. Thank you.
(Applause)
So I'm going to talk about work;
specifically, why people can't
seem to get work done at work,
which is a problem we all kind of have.
But let's sort of start at the beginning.
So, we have companies
and non-profits and charities
and all these groups that have
employees or volunteers of some sort.
And they expect these people
who work for them
to do great work --
I would hope, at least.
At least good work, hopefully,
at least it's good work --
hopefully great work.
And so what they typically
do is they decide
that all these people need to come
together in one place to do that work.
So a company, or a charity,
or an organization of any kind,
unless you're working in Africa,
if you're really lucky to do that --
most people have to go
to an office every day.
And so these companies,
they build offices.
They go out and they buy a building,
or they rent a building,
or they lease some space,
and they fill this space with stuff.
They fill it with tables, or desks,
chairs, computer equipment,
software, Internet access,
maybe a fridge, maybe a few other things,
and they expect their employees,
or their volunteers,
to come to that location
every day to do great work.
It seems like it's perfectly
reasonable to ask that.
However, if you actually talk to people
and even question yourself,
and you ask yourself,
where do you really want to go when you
really need to get something done?
You'll find out that people don't say
what businesses think they would say.
If you ask people the question:
Where do you need to go
when you need to get something done?
Typically, you get three different
kinds of answers.
One is kind of a place
or a location or a room.
Another one is a moving object,
and a third is a time.
So here are some examples.
I've been asking people this question
for about 10 years:
"Where do you go when you
really need to get something done?"
I'll hear things like, the porch,
the deck, the kitchen.
I'll hear things like
an extra room in the house,
the basement,
the coffee shop, the library.
And then you'll hear
things like the train,
a plane, a car -- so, the commute.
And then you'll hear people say,
"Well, it doesn't really
matter where I am,
as long as it's early in the morning
or late at night or on the weekends."
You almost never hear
someone say, "The office."
But businesses are spending all this money
on this place called the office,
and they're making people
go to it all the time,
yet people don't do work in the office.
What is that about?
(Laughter)
Why is that? Why is that happening?
And what you find out is,
if you dig a little bit deeper,
you find out that people --
this is what happens:
People go to work,
and they're basically
trading in their work day
for a series of "work moments" --
that's what happens at the office.
You don't have a work day anymore.
You have work moments.
It's like the front door
of the office is like a Cuisinart,
and you walk in and your day
is shredded to bits,
because you have 15 minutes here,
30 minutes there,
and something else happens,
you're pulled off your work,
then you have 20 minutes, then it's lunch,
then you have something else to do ...
Then you've got 15 minutes, and someone
pulls you aside and asks you a question,
and before you know it, it's 5 p.m.,
and you look back on the day,
and you realize that you
didn't get anything done.
We've all been through this.
We probably went through it yesterday
or the day before, or the day before that.
You look back on your day,
and you're like,
"I got nothing done today.
I was at work. I sat at my desk.
I used my expensive computer.
I used the software they told me to use.
I went to these meetings
I was asked to go to.
I did these conference calls.
I did all this stuff.
But I didn't actually do anything.
I just did tasks.
I didn't actually get
meaningful work done."
And what you find is that,
especially with creative people --
designers, programmers,
writers, engineers, thinkers --
that people really need long stretches
of uninterrupted time
to get something done.
You cannot ask somebody
to be creative in 15 minutes
and really think about a problem.
You might have a quick idea,
but to be in deep thought about a problem
and really consider a problem carefully,
you need long stretches
of uninterrupted time.
And even though the work day
is typically eight hours,
how many people here have ever had
eight hours to themselves at the office?
How about seven hours?
Six? Five? Four?
When's the last time you had
three hours to yourself at the office?
Two hours? One, maybe?
Very, very few people actually have
long stretches of uninterrupted
time at an office.
And this is why people
choose to do work at home,
or they might go to the office,
but they might go to the office
really early in the day,
or late at night when no one's around,
or they stick around
after everyone's left,
or go in on the weekends,
or they get work done on the plane,
in the car or in the train,
because there are no distractions.
Now there are different
kinds of distractions,
but not the really bad distractions,
which I'll talk about in a minute.
And this whole phenomenon of having
short bursts of time to get things done
reminds me of another thing
that doesn't work when you're interrupted,
and that is sleep.
I think that sleep and work
are very closely related --
not because you can work while you're
sleeping and sleep while you're working.
That's not really what I mean.
I'm talking specifically about the fact
that sleep and work are phase-based,
or stage-based, events.
Sleep is about sleep phases, or stages --
some people call them different things.
There are five of them, and in order
to get to the really deep ones,
the meaningful ones,
you have to go through the early ones.
If you're interrupted while you're
going through the early ones --
if someone bumps you in bed,
or there's a sound, or whatever happens --
you don't just pick up where you left off.
If you're interrupted and woken up,
you have to start again.
So you have to go back
a few phases and start again.
And what ends up happening --
you might have days like this
where you wake up at eight or seven
in the morning, or whenever you get up,
and you're like,
"I didn't sleep very well.
I did the sleep thing --
I went to bed, I laid down,
but I didn't really sleep."
People say you go "to" sleep,
but you don't go to sleep,
you go towards sleep; it takes a while.
You've got to go through phases and stuff,
and if you're interrupted,
you don't sleep well.
So does anyone here
expect someone to sleep well
if they're interrupted all night?
I don't think anyone would say yes.
Why do we expect people to work well
if they're being interrupted
all day at the office?
How can we possibly expect
people to do their job
if they go to the office
and are interrupted?
That doesn't really seem
like it makes a lot of sense, to me.
So what are the interruptions that happen
at the office but not at other places?
Because in other places, you can have
interruptions like the TV,
or you could go for a walk,
or there's a fridge downstairs,
or you've got your own couch,
or whatever you want to do.
If you talk to certain managers,
they'll tell you
that they don't want
their employees to work at home
because of these distractions.
They'll sometimes also say,
"If I can't see the person,
how do I know they're working?"
which is ridiculous, but that's one
of the excuses that managers give.
And I'm one of these managers.
I understand. I know how this goes.
We all have to improve
on this sort of thing.
But oftentimes they'll cite distractions:
"I can't let someone work at home.
They'll watch TV, or do this other thing."
It turns out those aren't
the things that are distracting,
Because those are voluntary distractions.
You decide when you want
to be distracted by the TV,
when you want to turn something on,
or when you want to go
downstairs or go for a walk.
At the office,
most of the interruptions and distractions
that really cause people not
to get work done are involuntary.
So let's go through a couple of those.
Now, managers and bosses
will often have you think
that the real distractions at work
are things like Facebook and Twitter
and YouTube and other websites,
and in fact, they'll go so far
as to actually ban these sites at work.
Some of you may work at places
where you can't get to certain sites.
I mean, is this China?
What the hell is going on here?
You can't go to a website at work,
and that's the problem?
That's why people aren't
getting work done,
because they're on Facebook and Twitter?
That's kind of ridiculous.
It's a total decoy.
Today's Facebook and Twitter and YouTube,
these things are just
modern-day smoke breaks.
No one cared about letting people take
a smoke break for 15 minutes 10 years ago,
so why does anyone care
if someone goes to Facebook
or Twitter or YouTube here and there?
Those aren't the real
problems in the office.
The real problems are
what I like to call the M&amp;Ms,
the Managers and the Meetings.
Those are the real problems
in the modern office today.
And this is why
things don't get done at work,
it's because of the M&amp;Ms.
Now what's interesting is,
if you listen to all the places
that people talk about doing work,
like at home, in the car, on a plane,
late at night, or early in the morning,
you don't find managers and meetings.
You find a lot of other distractions,
but not managers and meetings.
So these are the things
that you don't find elsewhere,
but you do find at the office.
And managers are basically people
whose job it is to interrupt people.
That's pretty much what managers are for.
They're for interrupting people.
They don't really do the work, so they
make sure everyone else is doing work,
which is an interruption.
We have lots of managers in the world now,
and a lot of people in the world,
and a lot of interruptions
by these managers.
They have to check in:
"Hey, how's it going?
Show me what's up." This sort of thing.
They keep interrupting you
at the wrong time,
while you're actually trying to do
something they're paying you to do,
they tend to interrupt you.
That's kind of bad.
But what's even worse is the thing
that managers do most of all,
which is call meetings.
And meetings are just toxic,
terrible, poisonous things
during the day at work.
(Laughter)
We all know this to be true,
and you would never see a spontaneous
meeting called by employees.
It doesn't work that way.
The manager calls the meeting
so the employees can all come together,
and it's an incredibly disruptive
thing to do to people --
to say, "Hey look,
we're going to bring 10 people
together right now and have a meeting.
I don't care what you're doing,
you've got to stop doing it,
so you can have this meeting."
I mean, what are the chances
that all 10 people are ready to stop?
What if they're thinking about something
important, or doing important work?
All of a sudden you tell them they have
to stop doing that to do something else.
So they go into a meeting room,
they get together,
and they talk about stuff
that doesn't really matter, usually.
Because meetings aren't work.
Meetings are places to go
to talk about things
you're supposed to be doing later.
But meetings also procreate.
So one meeting tends
to lead to another meeting,
which leads to another meeting.
There's often too many people
in the meetings,
and they're very, very expensive
to the organization.
Companies often think of a one-hour
meeting as a one-hour meeting,
but that's not true,
unless there's only one person.
If there are 10 people, it's a 10-hour
meeting, not a one-hour meeting.
It's 10 hours of productivity taken
from the rest of the organization
to have this one-hour meeting,
which probably should have been handled
by two or three people
talking for a few minutes.
But instead, there's a long
scheduled meeting,
because meetings are scheduled
the way software works,
which is in increments of 15 minutes,
or 30 minutes, or an hour.
You don't schedule an eight-hour meeting
with Outlook; you can't.
You can go 15 minutes or 30 minutes
or 45 minutes or an hour.
And so we tend to fill these times up
when things should go really quickly.
So meetings and managers are
two major problems in businesses today,
especially at offices.
These things don't exist
outside of the office.
So I have some suggestions
to remedy the situation.
What can managers do --
enlightened managers, hopefully --
what can they do to make the office
a better place for people to work,
so it's not the last resort,
but it's the first resort,
so that people start to say,
"When I really want to get stuff done,
I go to the office."
Because the offices are well-equipped;
everything is there
for them to do the work.
But they don't want to go there right
now, so how do we change that?
I have three suggestions
to share with you.
I have about three minutes,
so that'll fit perfectly.
We've all heard
of the Casual Friday thing.
I don't know if people still do that.
But how about "No-talk Thursdays?"
(Laughter)
Pick one Thursday once a month,
and cut it in half, just the afternoon --
I'll make it easy for you.
So just the afternoon, one Thursday.
First Thursday of the month,
just the afternoon,
nobody in the office
can talk to each other.
Just silence, that's it.
And what you'll find
is that a tremendous amount
of work gets done
when no one talks to each other.
This is when people
actually get stuff done,
is when no one's bothering them
or interrupting them.
Giving someone four hours
of uninterrupted time
is the best gift you can
give anybody at work.
It's better than a computer,
better than a new monitor,
better than new software,
or whatever people typically use.
Giving them four hours
of quiet time at the office
is going to be incredibly valuable.
If you try that, I think you'll agree,
and hopefully you can do it more often.
So maybe it's every other week,
or every week, once a week,
afternoons no one can talk to each other.
That's something that you'll find
will really, really work.
Another thing you can try,
is switching from active
communication and collaboration,
which is like face-to-face stuff --
tapping people on the shoulder,
saying hi to them, having meetings,
and replace that with more
passive models of communication,
using things like email
and instant messaging,
or collaboration products,
things like that.
Now some people might say
email is really distracting,
I.M. is really distracting, and these
other things are really distracting,
but they're distracting at a time
of your own choice and your own choosing.
You can quit the email app;
you can't quit your boss.
You can quit I.M.;
you can't hide your manager.
You can put these things away,
and then you can be interrupted
on your own schedule, at your own time,
when you're available,
when you're ready to go again.
Because work, like sleep,
happens in phases.
So you'll be going up, doing some work,
and then you'll come down from that work,
and then maybe it's time
to check that email or I.M.
There are very, very few things
that are that urgent,
that need to happen, that need
to be answered right this second.
So if you're a manager,
start encouraging people to use
more things like I.M. and email
and other things that someone can put away
and then get back to you
on their own schedule.
And the last suggestion I have is that,
if you do have a meeting coming up,
if you have the power, just cancel it.
Just cancel that next meeting.
(Laughter)
Today's Friday, usually people
have meetings on Monday.
Just don't have it.
I don't mean move it;
I mean just erase it
from memory, it's gone.
And you'll find out that everything
will be just fine.
All these discussions and decisions
you thought you had to make
at this one time at 9 a.m. on Monday,
just forget about them,
and things will be fine.
People will have a more open morning,
they can actually think.
You'll find out all these things
you thought you had to do,
you don't actually have to do.
So those are just three quick suggestions
I wanted to give you guys to think about.
I hope that some of these ideas
were at least provocative enough
for managers and bosses
and business owners
and organizers and people
who are in charge of other people,
to think about laying off a little bit,
and giving people more time
to get work done.
I think it'll all pay off in the end.
So, thanks for listening.
(Applause)
(Music)
(Music) (Applause)

This is Revolution 2.0.
No one was a hero. No one was a hero.
Because everyone was a hero.
Everyone has done something.
We all use Wikipedia.
If you think of the concept of Wikipedia
where everyone is collaborating on content,
and at the end of the day
you've built the largest encyclopedia in the world.
From just an idea that sounded crazy,
you have the largest encyclopedia in the world.
And in the Egyptian revolution,
the Revolution 2.0,
everyone has contributed something,
small or big. They contributed something --
to bring us
one of the most inspiring stories
in the history of mankind
when it comes to revolutions.
It was actually really inspiring
to see all these Egyptians completely changing.
If you look at the scene,
Egypt, for 30 years, had been in a downhill --
going into a downhill.
Everything was going bad.
Everything was going wrong.
We only ranked high when it comes to poverty,
corruption,
lack of freedom of speech,
lack of political activism.
Those were the achievements
of our great regime.
Yet, nothing was happening.
And it's not because people were happy
or people were not frustrated.
In fact, people were extremely frustrated.
But the reason why everyone was silent
is what I call the psychological barrier of fear.
Everyone was scared.
Not everyone. There were actually a few brave Egyptians
that I have to thank for being so brave --
going into protests as a couple of hundred,
getting beaten up and arrested.
But in fact, the majority were scared.
Everyone did not want really
to get in trouble.
A dictator cannot live without the force.
They want to make people live in fear.
And that psychological barrier of fear
had worked for so many years,
and here comes the Internet,
technology, BlackBerry, SMS.
It's helping all of us to connect.
Platforms like YouTube, Twitter, Facebook
were helping us a lot
because it basically gave us the impression that, "Wow, I'm not alone.
There are a lot of people who are frustrated."
There are lots of people who are frustrated.
There are lots of people who actually share the same dream.
There are lots of people who care about their freedom.
They probably have the best life in the world.
They are living in happiness. They are living in their villas.
They are happy. They don't have problems.
But they are still feeling the pain of the Egyptian.
A lot of us, we're not really happy
when we see a video of an Egyptian man
who's eating the trash
while others are stealing
billions of Egyptian pounds
from the wealth of the country.
The Internet has played a great role,
helping these people to speak up their minds,
to collaborate together, to start thinking together.
It was an educational campaign.
Khaled Saeed was killed
in June 2010.
I still remember the photo.
I still remember every single detail of that photo.
The photo was horrible.
He was tortured,
brutally tortured to death.
But then what was the answer of the regime?
"He choked on a pile of hash" --
that was their answer:
"He's a criminal.
He's someone who escaped from all these bad things."
But people did not relate to this.
People did not believe this.
Because of the Internet, the truth prevailed
and everyone knew the truth.
And everyone started to think that "this guy could be my brother."
He was a middle-class guy.
His photo was remembered by all of us.
A page was created.
An anonymous administrator
was basically inviting people to join the page,
and there was no plan.
"What are we going to do?" "I don't know."
In a few days, tens of thousands of people there --
angry Egyptians
who were asking the ministry of interior affairs,
"Enough.
Get those who killed this guy.
To just bring them to justice."
But of course, they don't listen.
It was an amazing story --
how everyone started feeling the ownership.
Everyone was an owner in this page.
People started contributing ideas.
In fact, one of the most ridiculous ideas
was, "Hey, let's have a silent stand.
Let's get people to go in the street,
face the sea, their back to the street,
dressed in black, standing up silently for one hour,
doing nothing and then just leaving,
going back home."
For some people, that was like, "Wow, silent stand.
And next time it's going to be vibration."
People were making fun of the idea.
But actually when people went to the street --
the first time it was thousands of people
in Alexandria --
it felt like -- it was amazing. It was great
because it connected people from the virtual world,
bringing them to the real world,
sharing the same dream,
the same frustration, the same anger,
the same desire for freedom.
And they were doing this thing.
But did the regime learn anything? Not really.
They were actually attacking them.
They were actually abusing them,
despite the fact of how peaceful these guys were --
they were not even protesting.
And things had developed
until the Tunisian revolution.
This whole page was, again,
managed by the people.
In fact, the anonymous admin job
was to collect ideas,
help people to vote on them
and actually tell them what they are doing.
People were taking shots and photos;
people were reporting violations of human rights in Egypt;
people were suggesting ideas,
they were actually voting on ideas,
and then they were executing the ideas; people were creating videos.
Everything was done by the people to the people,
and that's the power of the Internet.
There was no leader.
The leader was everyone on that page.
The Tunisian experiment, as Amir was saying,
inspired all of us, showed us that there is a way.
Yes we can. We can do it.
We have the same problems;
we can just go in the streets.
And when I saw the street on the 25th,
I went back and said,
"Egypt before the 25th
is never going to be Egypt after the 25th.
The revolution is happening.
This is not the end,
this is the beginning of the end."
I was detained on the 27th night.
Thank God I announced the locations and everything.
But they detained me.
And I'm not going to talk about my experience, because this is not about me.
I was detained for 12 days,
blindfolded, handcuffed.
And I did not really hear anything. I did not know anything.
I was not allowed to speak with anyone.
And I went out.
The next day I was in Tahrir.
Seriously, with the amount of change I had noticed in this square,
I thought it was 12 years.
I never had in my mind
to see this Egyptian,
the amazing Egyptian.
The fear is no longer fear.
It's actually strength -- it's power.
People were so empowered.
It was amazing how everyone was so empowered
and now asking for their rights.
Completely opposite.
Extremism became tolerance.
Who would [have] imagined before the 25th,
if I tell you that hundreds of thousands of Christians are going to pray
and tens of thousands of Muslims are going to protect them,
and then hundreds of thousands of Muslims are going to pray
and tens of thousands of Christians are going to protect them --
this is amazing.
All the stereotypes
that the regime was trying to put on us
through their so-called propaganda, or mainstream media,
are proven wrong.
This whole revolution showed us
how ugly such a regime was
and how great and amazing
the Egyptian man, the Egyptian woman,
how simple and amazing these people are
whenever they have a dream.
When I saw that,
I went back and I wrote on Facebook.
And that was a personal belief,
regardless of what's going on,
regardless of the details.
I said that, "We are going to win.
We are going to win because we don't understand politics.
We're going to win because we don't play their dirty games.
We're going to win because we don't have an agenda.
We're going to win because the tears that come from our eyes
actually come from our hearts.
We're going to win because we have dreams.
We're going to win because we are willing to stand up for our dreams."
And that's actually what happened. We won.
And that's not because of anything,
but because we believed in our dream.
The winning here is not
the whole details of what's going to happen in the political scene.
The winning is the winning of the dignity
of every single Egyptian.
Actually, I had this taxi driver telling me,
"Listen, I am breathing freedom.
I feel that I have dignity
that I have lost for so many years."
For me that's winning,
regardless of all the details.
My last word to you is a statement I believe in,
which Egyptians have proven to be true,
that the power of the people
is much stronger than the people in power.
Thanks a lot.
(Applause)
Do you think the world is going
to be a better place next year?
In the next decade?
Can we end hunger,
achieve gender equality,
halt climate change,
all in the next 15 years?
Well, according to the governments
of the world, yes we can.
In the last few days,
the leaders of the world,
meeting at the UN in New York,
agreed a new set of Global Goals
for the development of the world to 2030.
And here they are:
these goals are the product
of a massive consultation exercise.
The Global Goals are who we,
humanity, want to be.
Now that's the plan, but can we get there?
Can this vision for a better world
really be achieved?
Well, I'm here today because
we've run the numbers,
and the answer, shockingly,
is that maybe we actually can.
But not with business as usual.
Now, the idea that the world
is going to get a better place
may seem a little fanciful.
Watch the news every day and the world
seems to be going backwards, not forwards.
And let's be frank:
it's pretty easy to be skeptical
about grand announcements
coming out of the UN.
But please, I invite you to suspend
your disbelief for just a moment.
Because back in 2001,
the UN agreed another set of goals,
the Millennium Development Goals.
And the flagship target there
was to halve the proportion of people
living in poverty by 2015.
The target was to take
from a baseline of 1990,
when 36 percent of the world's
population lived in poverty,
to get to 18 percent poverty this year.
Did we hit this target?
Well, no, we didn't.
We exceeded it.
This year, global poverty
is going to fall to 12 percent.
Now, that's still not good enough,
and the world does still have
plenty of problems.
But the pessimists and doomsayers
who say that the world can't get better
are simply wrong.
So how did we achieve this success?
Well, a lot of it was because
of economic growth.
Some of the biggest reductions in poverty
were in countries such as China and India,
which have seen rapid
economic growth in recent years.
So can we pull off the same trick again?
Can economic growth
get us to the Global Goals?
Well, to answer that question,
we need to benchmark where the world
is today against the Global Goals
and figure out how far we have to travel.
But that ain't easy,
because the Global Goals
aren't just ambitious,
they're also pretty complicated.
Over 17 goals, there are then 169 targets
and literally hundreds of indicators.
Also, while some of the goals
are pretty specific --
end hunger --
others are a lot vaguer --
promote peaceful and tolerant societies.
So to help us with this benchmarking,
I'm going to use a tool
called the Social Progress Index.
What this does is measures all the stuff
the Global Goals are trying to achieve,
but sums it up into a single number
that we can use as our benchmark
and track progress over time.
The Social Progress Index basically asks
three fundamental questions
about a society.
First of all, does everyone have
the basic needs of survival:
food, water, shelter, safety?
Secondly, does everyone have
the building blocks of a better life:
education, information, health
and a sustainable environment?
And does everyone have
the opportunity to improve their lives,
through rights, freedom of choice,
freedom from discrimination,
and access to the world's
most advanced knowledge?
The Social Progress Index sums all this
together using 52 indicators
to create an aggregate score
on a scale of 0 to 100.
And what we find is that there's
a wide diversity of performance
in the world today.
The highest performing country,
Norway, scores 88.
The lowest performing country,
Central African Republic, scores 31.
And we can add up
all the countries together,
weighting for the different
population sizes,
and that global score is 61.
In concrete terms,
that means that the average human being
is living on a level of social progress
about the same of Cuba
or Kazakhstan today.
That's where we are today: 61 out of 100.
What do we have to get to
to achieve the Global Goals?
Now, the Global Goals
are certainly ambitious,
but they're not about turning the world
into Norway in just 15 years.
So having looked at the numbers,
my estimate is that a score of 75
would not only be a giant leap forward
in human well-being,
it would also count as hitting
the Global Goals target.
So there's our target, 75 out of 100.
Can we get there?
Well, the Social Progress Index
can help us calculate this,
because as you might have noticed,
there are no economic indicators in there;
there's no GDP or economic growth
in the Social Progress Index model.
And what that lets us do
is understand the relationship
between economic growth
and social progress.
Let me show you on this chart.
So here on the vertical axis,
I've put social progress,
the stuff the Global Goals
are trying to achieve.
Higher is better.
And then on the horizontal axis,
is GDP per capita.
Further to the right means richer.
And in there, I'm now going to put
all the countries of the world,
each one represented by a dot,
and on top of that I'm going to put
the regression line
that shows the average relationship.
And what this tells us
is that as we get richer,
social progress does tend to improve.
However, as we get richer,
each extra dollar of GDP
is buying us less and less
social progress.
And now we can use this information
to start building our forecast.
So here is the world in 2015.
We have a social progress score of 61
and a GDP per capita of $14,000.
And the place we're trying to get to,
remember, is 75, that Global Goals target.
So here we are today,
$14,000 per capita GDP.
How rich are we going to be in 2030?
That's what we need to know next.
Well, the best forecast we can find comes
from the US Department of Agriculture,
which forecasts 3.1 percent
average global economic growth
over the next 15 years,
which means that in 2030,
if they're right,
per capita GDP will be about $23,000.
So now the question is:
if we get that much richer,
how much social progress
are we going to get?
Well, we asked a team
of economists at Deloitte
who checked and crunched the numbers,
and they came back and said, well, look:
if the world's average wealth goes
from $14,000 a year to $23,000 a year,
social progress is going to increase
from 61 to 62.4.
(Laughter)
Just 62.4. Just a tiny increase.
Now this seems a bit strange.
Economic growth seems
to have really helped
in the fight against poverty,
but it doesn't seem
to be having much impact
on trying to get to the Global Goals.
So what's going on?
Well, I think there are two things.
The first is that in a way,
we're the victims of our own success.
We've used up the easy wins
from economic growth,
and now we're moving on
to harder problems.
And also, we know that economic growth
comes with costs as well as benefits.
There are costs to the environment, costs
from new health problems like obesity.
So that's the bad news.
We're not going to get to the Global Goals
just by getting richer.
So are the pessimists right?
Well, maybe not.
Because the Social Progress Index
also has some very good news.
Let me take you back
to that regression line.
So this is the average relationship
between GDP and social progress,
and this is what our
last forecast was based on.
But as you saw already,
there is actually lots of noise
around this trend line.
What that tells us, quite simply,
is that GDP is not destiny.
We have countries that are underperforming
on social progress,
relative to their wealth.
Russia has lots
of natural resource wealth,
but lots of social problems.
China has boomed economically,
but hasn't made much headway
on human rights or environmental issues.
India has a space program
and millions of people without toilets.
Now, on the other hand, we have countries
that are overperforming
on social progress relative to their GDP.
Costa Rica has prioritized education,
health and environmental sustainability,
and as a result, it's achieving
a very high level of social progress,
despite only having a rather modest GDP.
And Costa Rica's not alone.
From poor countries like Rwanda
to richer countries like New Zealand,
we see that it's possible to get
lots of social progress,
even if your GDP is not so great.
And that's really important,
because it tells us two things.
First of all, it tells us that we already
in the world have the solutions
to many of the problems
that the Global Goals are trying to solve.
It also tells us
that we're not slaves to GDP.
Our choices matter: if we prioritize
the well-being of people,
then we can make a lot more progress
than our GDP might expect.
How much? Enough to get us
to the Global Goals?
Well, let's look at some numbers.
What we know already: the world today
is scoring 61 on social progress,
and the place we want to get to is 75.
If we rely on economic growth alone,
we're going to get to 62.4.
So let's assume now that we can get
the countries that are currently
underperforming on social progress --
the Russia, China, Indias --
just up to the average.
How much social progress does that get us?
Well, that takes us to 65.
It's a bit better, but still
quite a long way to go.
So let's get a little bit more
optimistic and say,
what if every country
gets a little bit better
at turning its wealth into well-being?
Well then, we get to 67.
And now let's be even bolder still.
What if every country in the world
chose to be like Costa Rica
in prioritizing human well-being,
using its wealth for the well-being
of its citizens?
Well then, we get to nearly 73,
very close to the Global Goals.
Can we achieve the Global Goals?
Certainly not with business as usual.
Even a flood tide of economic growth
is not going to get us there,
if it just raises the mega-yachts
and the super-wealthy
and leaves the rest behind.
If we're going to achieve the Global Goals
we have to do things differently.
We have to prioritize social progress,
and really scale solutions
around the world.
I believe the Global Goals
are a historic opportunity,
because the world's leaders
have promised to deliver them.
Let's not dismiss the goals
or slide into pessimism;
let's hold them to that promise.
And we need to hold them to that promise
by holding them accountable,
tracking their progress all the way
through the next 15 years.
And I want to finish by showing you
a way to do that, called
the People's Report Card.
The People's Report Card brings together
all this data into a simple framework
that we'll all be familiar
with from our school days,
to hold them to account.
It grades our performance
on the Global Goals
on a scale from F to A,
where F is humanity at its worst,
and A is humanity at its best.
Our world today is scoring a C-.
The Global Goals are all about
getting to an A,
and that's why we're going to be updating
the People's Report Card annually,
for the world and for all
the countries of the world,
so we can hold our leaders to account
to achieve this target
and fulfill this promise.
Because getting to the Global Goals will
only happen if we do things differently,
if our leaders do things differently,
and for that to happen,
that needs us to demand it.
So let's reject business as usual.
Let's demand a different path.
Let's choose the world that we want.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Bruno Giussani: Thank you, Michael.
Michael, just one question:
the Millennium Development Goals
established 15 years ago,
they were kind of applying
to every country
but it turned out to be really
a scorecard for emerging countries.
Now the new Global Goals
are explicitly universal.
They ask for every country to show action
and to show progress.
How can I, as a private citizen,
use the report card
to create pressure for action?
Michael Green: This is a really important
point; it's a big shift in priorities --
it's no longer about poor
countries and just poverty.
It's about every country.
And every country is going to have
challenges in getting to the Global Goals.
Even, I'm sorry to say, Bruno,
Switzerland has got to work to do.
And so that's why we're going to produce
these report cards in 2016
for every country in the world.
Then we can really see, how are we doing?
And it's not going to be rich countries
scoring straight A's.
And that, then, I think,
is to provide a point of focus
for people to start demanding action
and start demanding progress.
BG: Thank you very much.
(Applause)
Everyone, please think
of your biggest personal goal.
For real -- you can take a second.
You've got to feel this to learn it.
Take a few seconds and think
of your personal biggest goal, okay?
Imagine deciding right now
that you're going to do it.
Imagine telling someone that you
meet today what you're going to do.
Imagine their congratulations,
and their high image of you.
Doesn't it feel good to say it out loud?
Don't you feel one step closer already,
like it's already becoming
part of your identity?
Well, bad news: you should
have kept your mouth shut,
because that good feeling
now will make you less likely to do it.
The repeated psychology tests have proven
that telling someone your goal
makes it less likely to happen.
Any time you have a goal,
there are some steps that need to be done,
some work that needs to be done
in order to achieve it.
Ideally you would not be satisfied
until you'd actually done the work.
But when you tell someone your goal
and they acknowledge it,
psychologists have found
that it's called a "social reality."
The mind is kind of tricked
into feeling that it's already done.
And then because you've felt
that satisfaction,
you're less motivated to do
the actual hard work necessary.
(Laughter)
So this goes against conventional wisdom
that we should tell our friends
our goals, right?
So they hold us to it.
So, let's look at the proof.
1926: Kurt Lewin,
founder of social psychology,
called this "substitution."
1933: Wera Mahler found
when it was acknowledged by others,
it felt real in the mind.
1982, Peter Gollwitzer
wrote a whole book about this,
and in 2009,
he did some new tests that were published.
It goes like this:
163 people across four separate tests.
Everyone wrote down their personal goal.
Then half of them announced
their commitment to this goal to the room,
and half didn't.
Then everyone was given 45 minutes of work
that would directly lead them
towards their goal,
but they were told
that they could stop at any time.
Now, those who kept their mouths shut
worked the entire 45 minutes on average,
and when asked afterward,
said that they felt
that they had a long way to go still
to achieve their goal.
But those who had announced it
quit after only 33 minutes, on average,
and when asked afterward,
said that they felt much closer
to achieving their goal.
So if this is true, what can we do?
Well, you could resist the temptation
to announce your goal.
You can delay the gratification
that the social acknowledgment brings,
and you can understand that your mind
mistakes the talking for the doing.
But if you do need
to talk about something,
you can state it in a way
that gives you no satisfaction,
such as, "I really want
to run this marathon,
so I need to train five times a week
and kick my ass if I don't, okay?"
So audience, next time you're
tempted to tell someone your goal,
what will you say?
(Silence)
Exactly! Well done.
(Laughter)
(Applause)
The sound is a really big part, I think,
of the experience of using a pencil,
and it has this really
audible scratchiness.
(Scratching)
[Small thing. Big idea.]
[Caroline Weaver on
the Pencil]
The pencil is a very simple object.
It's made of wood
with some layers of paint
an eraser and a core,
which is made out of graphite,
clay and water.
Yeah, it took hundreds
of people over centuries
to come to this design.
And it's that long history
of collaboration
that, to me, makes it
a very perfect object.
The story of the pencil
starts with graphite.
People started finding
really useful applications
for this new substance.
They cut it into small sticks
and wrapped it in string
or sheepskin or paper
and sold it on the streets of London
to be used for writing or for drawing
or, a lot of times,
by farmers and shepherds,
who used it to mark their animals.
Over in France,
Nicolas-Jacques Conté figured out a method
of grinding the graphite,
mixing it with powdered clay
and water to make a paste.
From there, this paste was filled
into a mold and fired in a kiln,
and the result was
a really strong graphite core
that wasn't breakable,
that was smooth, usable --
it was so much better than anything else
that existed at the time,
and to this day, that's the method
that's still used in making pencils.
Meanwhile, over in America,
in Concord, Massachusetts,
it was Henry David Thoreau
who came up with the grading scale
for different hardnesses of pencil.
It was graded one through four,
number two being the ideal
hardness for general use.
The softer the pencil,
the more graphite it had in it,
and the darker and smoother
the line will be.
The firmer the pencil,
the more clay it had in it
and the lighter and finer it will be.
Originally, when pencils were handmade,
they were made round.
There was no easy way to make them,
and it was the Americans
who really mechanized the craft.
A lot of people credit Joseph Dixon
for being one of the first people
to start developing actual machines
to do things like cut wood slats,
cut grooves into the wood,
apply glue to them ...
And they figured out
it was easier and less wasteful
to do a hexagonal pencil,
and so that became the standard.
Since the early days of pencils,
people have loved that they can be erased.
Originally, it was bread crumbs
that were used
to scratch away pencil marks
and later, rubber and pumice.
The attached eraser happened in 1858,
when American stationer
Hymen Lipman patented the first pencil
with an attached eraser,
which really changed the pencil game.
The world's first yellow pencil
was the KOH-I-NOOR 1500.
KOH-I-NOOR did this crazy thing
where they painted this pencil
with 14 coats of yellow paint
and dipped the end in 14-carat gold.
There is a pencil for everyone,
and every pencil has a story.
The Blackwing 602 is famous
for being used by a lot of writers,
especially John Steinbeck
and Vladimir Nabokov.
And then, you have
the Dixon pencil company.
They're responsible
for the Dixon Ticonderoga.
It's an icon,
it's what people think of
when they think of a pencil
and what they think of
when they think of school.
And the pencil's really
a thing that, I think,
the average user
has never thought twice about,
how it's made or why it's made
the way it is,
because it's just always been that way.
In my opinion, there's nothing
that can be done
to make the pencil better than it is.
It's perfect.
Jenni Chang: When I told
my parents I was gay,
the first thing they said to me was,
"We're bringing you back to Taiwan."
(Laughter)
In their minds, my sexual orientation
was America's fault.
The West had corrupted me
with divergent ideas,
and if only my parents
had never left Taiwan,
this would not have happened
to their only daughter.
In truth, I wondered if they were right.
Of course, there are gay people in Asia,
just as there are gay people
in every part of the world.
But is the idea of living an "out" life,
in the "I'm gay, this is my spouse,
and we're proud of our lives together"
kind of way just a Western idea?
If I had grown up in Taiwan,
or any place outside of the West,
would I have found models
of happy, thriving LGBT people?
Lisa Dazols: I had similar notions.
As an HIV social worker in San Francisco,
I had met many gay immigrants.
They told me their stories
of persecution in their home countries,
just for being gay,
and the reasons
why they escaped to the US.
I saw how this had beaten them down.
After 10 years of doing this kind of work,
I needed better stories for myself.
I knew the world was far from perfect,
but surely not every gay story was tragic.
JC: So as a couple, we both had a need
to find stories of hope.
So we set off on a mission
to travel the world
and look for the people
we finally termed as the "Supergays."
(Laughter)
These would be the LGBT individuals
who were doing something
extraordinary in the world.
They would be courageous, resilient,
and most of all, proud of who they were.
They would be the kind of person
that I aspire to be.
Our plan was to share their stories
to the world through film.
LD: There was just one problem.
We had zero reporting
and zero filmmaking experience.
(Laughter)
We didn't even know
where to find the Supergays,
so we just had to trust that we'd
figure it all out along the way.
So we picked 15 countries
in Asia, Africa and South America,
countries outside the West
that varied in terms of LGBT rights.
We bought a camcorder,
ordered a book
on how to make a documentary --
(Laughter)
you can learn a lot these days --
and set off on an around-the-world trip.
JC: One of the first countries
that we traveled to was Nepal.
Despite widespread poverty,
a decade-long civil war,
and now recently,
a devastating earthquake,
Nepal has made significant strides
in the fight for equality.
One of the key figures
in the movement is Bhumika Shrestha.
A beautiful, vibrant transgendered woman,
Bhumika has had to overcome
being expelled from school
and getting incarcerated
because of her gender presentation.
But, in 2007, Bhumika
and Nepal's LGBT rights organization
successfully petitioned
the Nepali Supreme Court
to protect against LGBT discrimination.
Here's Bhumika:
(Video) BS: What I'm most proud of?
I'm a transgendered person.
I'm so proud of my life.
On December 21, 2007,
the supreme court gave the decision
for the Nepal government
to give transgender identity cards
and same-sex marriage.
LD: I can appreciate
Bhumika's confidence on a daily basis.
Something as simple
as using a public restroom
can be a huge challenge
when you don't fit in
to people's strict gender expectations.
Traveling throughout Asia,
I tended to freak out women
in public restrooms.
They weren't used to seeing
someone like me.
I had to come up with a strategy,
so that I could just pee in peace.
(Laughter)
So anytime I would enter a restroom,
I would thrust out my chest
to show my womanly parts,
and try to be as
non-threatening as possible.
Putting out my hands and saying, "Hello",
just so that people
could hear my feminine voice.
This all gets pretty exhausting,
but it's just who I am.
I can't be anything else.
JC: After Nepal, we traveled to India.
On one hand, India is a Hindu society,
without a tradition of homophobia.
On the other hand, it is also a society
with a deeply patriarchal system,
which rejects anything
that threatens the male-female order.
When we spoke to activists,
they told us that empowerment begins
with ensuring proper gender equality,
where the women's status
is established in society.
And in that way, the status of LGBT people
can be affirmed as well.
LD: There we met Prince Manvendra.
He's the world's first openly gay prince.
Prince Manvendra came out
on the "Oprah Winfrey Show,"
very internationally.
His parents disowned him
and accused him of bringing
great shame to the royal family.
We sat down with Prince Manvendra
and talked to him about why he decided
to come out so very publicly.
Here he is:
(Video) Prince Manvendra: 
I felt there was a lot of need
to break this stigma and discrimination
which is existing in our society.
And that instigated me to come out openly
and talk about myself.
Whether we are gay, we are lesbian,
we are transgender, bisexual
or whatever sexual minority we come from,
we have to all unite
and fight for our rights.
Gay rights cannot be won
in the court rooms,
but in the hearts and the minds
of the people.
JC: While getting my hair cut,
the woman cutting my hair asked me,
"Do you have a husband?"
Now, this was a dreaded question
that I got asked a lot
by locals while traveling.
When I explained to her
that I was with a woman instead of a man,
she was incredulous,
and she asked me a lot of questions
about my parents' reactions
and whether I was sad
that I'd never be able to have children.
I told her that there are
no limitations to my life
and that Lisa and I do plan
to have a family some day.
Now, this woman was ready to write me off
as yet another crazy Westerner.
She couldn't imagine
that such a phenomenon
could happen in her own country.
That is, until I showed her
the photos of the Supergays
that we interviewed in India.
She recognized Prince Manvendra
from television
and soon I had an audience
of other hairdressers
interested in meeting me.
(Laughter)
And in that ordinary afternoon,
I had the chance to introduce
an entire beauty salon
to the social changes
that were happening in their own country.
LD: From India,
we traveled to East Africa,
a region known for intolerance
towards LGBT people.
In Kenya, 89 percent of people
who come out to their families
are disowned.
Homosexual acts are a crime
and can lead to incarceration.
In Kenya, we met
the soft-spoken David Kuria.
David had a huge mission
of wanting to work for the poor
and improve his own government.
So he decided to run for senate.
He became Kenya's first
openly gay political candidate.
David wanted to run his campaign
without denying the reality of who he was.
But we were worried for his safety
because he started
to receive death threats.
(Video) David Kuria: 
At that point, I was really scared
because they were
actually asking for me to be killed.
And, yeah,
there are some people out there who do it
and they feel that they are doing
a religious obligation.
JC: David wasn't ashamed of who he was.
Even in the face of threats,
he stayed authentic.
LD: At the opposite end
of the spectrum is Argentina.
Argentina's a country where 92 percent
of the population identifies as Catholic.
Yet, Argentina has LGBT laws
that are even more progressive
than here in the US.
In 2010, Argentina became
the first country in Latin America
and the 10th in the world
to adopt marriage equality.
There, we met María Rachid.
María was a driving force
behind that movement.
María Rachid (Spanish):
I always say that, in reality,
the effects of marriage equality
are not only for those couples
that get married.
They are for a lot of people that,
even though they may never get married,
will be perceived differently
by their coworkers,
their families and neighbors,
from the national state's
message of equality.
I feel very proud of Argentina
because Argentina today
is a model of equality.
And hopefully soon,
the whole world will have the same rights.
JC: When we made the visit
to my ancestral lands,
I wish I could have shown
my parents what we found there.
Because here is who we met:
(Video) One, two, three.
Welcome gays to Shanghai!
(Laughter)
A whole community of young,
beautiful Chinese LGBT people.
Sure, they had their struggles.
But they were fighting it out.
In Shanghai, I had the chance
to speak to a local lesbian group
and tell them our story
in my broken Mandarin Chinese.
In Taipei, each time
we got onto the metro,
we saw yet another
lesbian couple holding hands.
And we learned that Asia's
largest LGBT pride event
happens just blocks away
from where my grandparents live.
If only my parents knew.
LD: By the time we finished our
not-so-straight journey around the world,
(Laughter)
we had traveled 50,000 miles
and logged 120 hours of video footage.
We traveled to 15 countries
and interviewed 50 Supergays.
Turns out, it wasn't hard
to find them at all.
JC: Yes, there are still
tragedies that happen
on the bumpy road to equality.
And let's not forget that 75 countries
still criminalize homosexuality today.
But there are also stories
of hope and courage
in every corner of the world.
What we ultimately took away
from our journey is,
equality is not a Western invention.
LD: One of the key factors
in this equality movement is momentum,
momentum as more and more people
embrace their full selves
and use whatever opportunities they have
to change their part of the world,
and momentum as more and more countries
find models of equality in one another.
When Nepal protected
against LGBT discrimination,
India pushed harder.
When Argentina embraced marriage equality,
Uruguay and Brazil followed.
When Ireland said yes to equality,
(Applause)
the world stopped to notice.
When the US Supreme Court
makes a statement to the world
that we can all be proud of.
(Applause)
JC: As we reviewed our footage,
what we realized is that
we were watching a love story.
It wasn't a love story
that was expected of me,
but it is one filled
with more freedom, adventure and love
than I could have ever possibly imagined.
One year after returning home
from our trip,
marriage equality came to California.
And in the end, we believe,
love will win out.
(Video) By the power vested in me,
by the state of California
and by God Almighty,
I now pronounce you spouses for life.
You may kiss.
(Applause)
You probably already know
everything is made up
of little tiny things called atoms
or even that each atom
is made up of even smaller particles
called protons, neutrons and electrons.
And you've probably heard
that atoms are small.
But I bet you haven't ever thought
about how small atoms really are.
Well, the answer is
that they are really, really small.
So you ask, just how small are atoms?
To understand this,
let's ask this question:
How many atoms are in a grapefruit?
Well, let's assume that the grapefruit
is made up of only nitrogen atoms,
which isn't at all true, but there
are nitrogen atoms in a grapefruit.
To help you visualize this,
let's blow up each of the atoms
to the size of a blueberry.
And then how big
would the grapefruit have to be?
It would have to be the same size of
-- well, actually, the Earth.
That's crazy!
You mean to say that if I filled
the Earth with blueberries,
I would have the same number
of nitrogen atoms as a grapefruit?
That's right!
So how big is the atom?
Well, it's really, really small!
And you know what?
It gets even more crazy.
Let's now look inside of each atom
-- and thus the blueberry, right? --
What do you see there?
In the center of the atom
is something called the nucleus,
which contains protons and neutrons,
and on the outside, you'd see electrons.
So how big is the nucleus?
If atoms are like blueberries
in the Earth,
how big would the nucleus be?
You might remember the old pictures
of the atom from science class,
where you saw this tiny dot on the page
with an arrow pointing to the nucleus.
Well, those pictures,
they're not drawn to scale,
so they're kind of wrong.
So how big is the nucleus?
So if you popped open the blueberry
and were searching for the nucleus ...
You know what? It would be invisible.
It's too small to see!
OK. Let's blow up the atom --
the blueberry --
to the size of a house.
So imagine a ball that is as tall
as a two-story house.
Let's look for the nucleus
in the center of the atom.
And do you know what?
It would just barely be visible.
So to get our minds wrapped
around how big the nucleus is,
we need to blow up the blueberry,
up to the size of a football stadium.
So imagine a ball the size
of a football stadium,
and right smack dab
in the center of the atom,
you would find the nucleus,
and you could see it!
And it would be the size
of a small marble.
And there's more, if I haven't
blown your mind by now.
Let's consider the atom some more.
It contains protons,
neutrons and electrons.
The protons and neutrons
live inside of the nucleus,
and contain almost
all of the mass of the atom.
Way on the edge are the electrons.
So if an atom is like a ball
the size of a football stadium,
with the nucleus in the center,
and the electrons on the edge,
what is in between the nucleus
and the electrons?
Surprisingly, the answer is empty space.
(Wind noise)
That's right. Empty!
Between the nucleus and the electrons,
there are vast regions of empty space.
Now, technically there are
some electromagnetic fields,
but in terms of stuff,
matter, it is empty.
Remember this vast region of empty space
is inside the blueberry,
which is inside the Earth,
which really are the atoms
in the grapefruit.
OK, one more thing,
if I can even get more bizarre.
Since virtually all the mass
of an atom is in the nucleus --
now, there is some amount
of mass in the electrons,
but most of it is in the nucleus --
how dense is the nucleus?
Well, the answer is crazy.
The density of a typical nucleus
is four times 10 to the 17th
kilograms per meter cubed.
But that's hard to visualize.
OK, I'll put it in English units.
2.5 times 10 to the 16th pounds
per cubic feet.
OK, that's still kind of hard to figure.
OK, here's what I want you to do.
Make a box that is one foot
by one foot by one foot.
Now let's go and grab
all of the nuclei from a typical car.
Now, cars on average weigh two tons.
How many cars' nuclei would you
have to put into the box
to have your one-foot-box have
the same density of the nucleus?
Is it one car? Two?
How about 100?
Nope, nope and nope.
The answer is much bigger.
It is 6.2 billion.
That is almost equal to the number
of people in the Earth.
So if everyone in the Earth
owned their own car --
and they don't --
(Cars honking)
and we put all of those
cars into your box ...
That would be about
the density of a nucleus.
So I'm saying that if you took
every car in the world
and put it into your one-foot box,
you would have the density of one nucleus.
OK, let's review.
The atom is really,
really, really small.
Think atoms in a grapefruit
like blueberries in the Earth.
The nucleus is crazy small.
Now look inside the blueberry,
and blow it up to the size
of a football stadium,
and now the nucleus
is a marble in the middle.
The atom is made up
of vast regions of empty space.
That's weird.
The nucleus has a crazy-high density.
Think of putting all those cars
in your one-foot box.
I think I'm tired.
So, security is two different things:
it's a feeling, and it's a reality.
And they're different.
You could feel secure even if you're not.
And you can be secure
even if you don't feel it.
Really, we have two separate concepts
mapped onto the same word.
And what I want to do in this talk
is to split them apart --
figuring out when they diverge
and how they converge.
And language is actually a problem here.
There aren't a lot of good words
for the concepts
we're going to talk about.
So if you look at security
from economic terms,
it's a trade-off.
Every time you get some security,
you're always trading off something.
Whether this is a personal decision --
whether you're going to install
a burglar alarm in your home --
or a national decision,
where you're going to invade
a foreign country --
you're going to trade off something:
money or time, convenience, capabilities,
maybe fundamental liberties.
And the question to ask
when you look at a security anything
is not whether this makes us safer,
but whether it's worth the trade-off.
You've heard in the past
several years, the world is safer
because Saddam Hussein is not in power.
That might be true,
but it's not terribly relevant.
The question is: Was it worth it?
And you can make your own decision,
and then you'll decide
whether the invasion was worth it.
That's how you think about security:
in terms of the trade-off.
Now, there's often no right or wrong here.
Some of us have a burglar alarm
system at home and some of us don't.
And it'll depend on where we live,
whether we live alone or have a family,
how much cool stuff we have,
how much we're willing
to accept the risk of theft.
In politics also,
there are different opinions.
A lot of times, these trade-offs
are about more than just security,
and I think that's really important.
Now, people have a natural intuition
about these trade-offs.
We make them every day.
Last night in my hotel room,
when I decided to double-lock the door,
or you in your car when you drove here;
when we go eat lunch
and decide the food's not
poison and we'll eat it.
We make these trade-offs again and again,
multiple times a day.
We often won't even notice them.
They're just part
of being alive; we all do it.
Every species does it.
Imagine a rabbit in a field, eating grass.
And the rabbit sees a fox.
That rabbit will make
a security trade-off:
"Should I stay, or should I flee?"
And if you think about it,
the rabbits that are good
at making that trade-off
will tend to live and reproduce,
and the rabbits that are bad at it
will get eaten or starve.
So you'd think
that us, as a successful species
on the planet -- you, me, everybody --
would be really good
at making these trade-offs.
Yet it seems, again and again,
that we're hopelessly bad at it.
And I think that's a fundamentally
interesting question.
I'll give you the short answer.
The answer is, we respond
to the feeling of security
and not the reality.
Now, most of the time, that works.
Most of the time,
feeling and reality are the same.
Certainly that's true
for most of human prehistory.
We've developed this ability
because it makes evolutionary sense.
One way to think of it
is that we're highly optimized
for risk decisions
that are endemic to living
in small family groups
in the East African Highlands
in 100,000 BC.
2010 New York, not so much.
Now, there are several biases
in risk perception.
A lot of good experiments in this.
And you can see certain biases
that come up again and again.
I'll give you four.
We tend to exaggerate
spectacular and rare risks
and downplay common risks --
so, flying versus driving.
The unknown is perceived
to be riskier than the familiar.
One example would be:
people fear kidnapping by strangers,
when the data supports that kidnapping
by relatives is much more common.
This is for children.
Third, personified risks
are perceived to be greater
than anonymous risks.
So, Bin Laden is scarier
because he has a name.
And the fourth is:
people underestimate risks
in situations they do control
and overestimate them
in situations they don't control.
So once you take up skydiving or smoking,
you downplay the risks.
If a risk is thrust upon you --
terrorism is a good example --
you'll overplay it,
because you don't feel
like it's in your control.
There are a bunch
of other of these cognitive biases,
that affect our risk decisions.
There's the availability heuristic,
which basically means we estimate
the probability of something
by how easy it is to bring
instances of it to mind.
So you can imagine how that works.
If you hear a lot about tiger attacks,
there must be a lot of tigers around.
You don't hear about lion attacks,
there aren't a lot of lions around.
This works, until you invent newspapers,
because what newspapers do
is repeat again and again
rare risks.
I tell people: if it's in the news,
don't worry about it,
because by definition, news is something
that almost never happens.
(Laughter)
When something is so common,
it's no longer news.
Car crashes, domestic violence --
those are the risks you worry about.
We're also a species of storytellers.
We respond to stories more than data.
And there's some basic
innumeracy going on.
I mean, the joke "One, two,
three, many" is kind of right.
We're really good at small numbers.
One mango, two mangoes, three mangoes,
10,000 mangoes, 100,000 mangoes --
it's still more mangoes
you can eat before they rot.
So one half, one quarter,
one fifth -- we're good at that.
One in a million, one in a billion --
they're both almost never.
So we have trouble with the risks
that aren't very common.
And what these cognitive biases do
is they act as filters
between us and reality.
And the result is that feeling
and reality get out of whack,
they get different.
Now, you either have a feeling --
you feel more secure than you are,
there's a false sense of security.
Or the other way, and that's a false
sense of insecurity.
I write a lot about "security theater,"
which are products
that make people feel secure,
but don't actually do anything.
There's no real word for stuff
that makes us secure,
but doesn't make us feel secure.
Maybe it's what the CIA
is supposed to do for us.
So back to economics.
If economics, if the market,
drives security,
and if people make trade-offs
based on the feeling of security,
then the smart thing for companies to do
for the economic incentives
is to make people feel secure.
And there are two ways to do this.
One, you can make people actually secure
and hope they notice.
Or two, you can make people
just feel secure
and hope they don't notice.
Right?
So what makes people notice?
Well, a couple of things:
understanding of the security,
of the risks, the threats,
the countermeasures, how they work.
But if you know stuff, you're more likely
to have your feelings match reality.
Enough real-world examples helps.
We all know the crime rate
in our neighborhood,
because we live there,
and we get a feeling about it
that basically matches reality.
Security theater is exposed
when it's obvious
that it's not working properly.
OK. So what makes people not notice?
Well, a poor understanding.
If you don't understand the risks,
you don't understand the costs,
you're likely to get the trade-off wrong,
and your feeling doesn't match reality.
Not enough examples.
There's an inherent problem
with low-probability events.
If, for example, terrorism
almost never happens,
it's really hard to judge the efficacy
of counter-terrorist measures.
This is why you keep sacrificing virgins,
and why your unicorn defenses
are working just great.
There aren't enough examples of failures.
Also, feelings that cloud the issues --
the cognitive biases I talked
about earlier: fears, folk beliefs --
basically, an inadequate model of reality.
So let me complicate things.
I have feeling and reality.
I want to add a third element.
I want to add "model."
Feeling and model are in our head,
reality is the outside world;
it doesn't change, it's real.
Feeling is based on our intuition,
model is based on reason.
That's basically the difference.
In a primitive and simple world,
there's really no reason for a model,
because feeling is close to reality.
You don't need a model.
But in a modern and complex world,
you need models to understand
a lot of the risks we face.
There's no feeling about germs.
You need a model to understand them.
This model is an intelligent
representation of reality.
It's, of course, limited
by science, by technology.
We couldn't have a germ theory of disease
before we invented
the microscope to see them.
It's limited by our cognitive biases.
But it has the ability
to override our feelings.
Where do we get these models?
We get them from others.
We get them from religion,
from culture, teachers, elders.
A couple years ago,
I was in South Africa on safari.
The tracker I was with grew up
in Kruger National Park.
He had some very complex
models of how to survive.
And it depended on if you were attacked
by a lion, leopard, rhino, or elephant --
and when you had to run away,
when you couldn't run away,
when you had to climb a tree,
when you could never climb a tree.
I would have died in a day.
But he was born there,
and he understood how to survive.
I was born in New York City.
I could have taken him to New York,
and he would have died in a day.
(Laughter)
Because we had different models
based on our different experiences.
Models can come from the media,
from our elected officials ...
Think of models of terrorism,
child kidnapping,
airline safety, car safety.
Models can come from industry.
The two I'm following
are surveillance cameras,
ID cards,
quite a lot of our computer
security models come from there.
A lot of models come from science.
Health models are a great example.
Think of cancer, bird flu,
swine flu, SARS.
All of our feelings of security
about those diseases
come from models given to us, really,
by science filtered through the media.
So models can change.
Models are not static.
As we become more comfortable
in our environments,
our model can move closer to our feelings.
So an example might be,
if you go back 100 years ago,
when electricity was first
becoming common,
there were a lot of fears about it.
There were people who were afraid
to push doorbells,
because there was electricity
in there, and that was dangerous.
For us, we're very facile
around electricity.
We change light bulbs
without even thinking about it.
Our model of security around electricity
is something we were born into.
It hasn't changed as we were growing up.
And we're good at it.
Or think of the risks on the Internet
across generations --
how your parents approach
Internet security,
versus how you do,
versus how our kids will.
Models eventually fade
into the background.
"Intuitive" is just
another word for familiar.
So as your model is close to reality
and it converges with feelings,
you often don't even know it's there.
A nice example of this came
from last year and swine flu.
When swine flu first appeared,
the initial news caused
a lot of overreaction.
Now, it had a name,
which made it scarier
than the regular flu,
even though it was more deadly.
And people thought doctors
should be able to deal with it.
So there was that feeling
of lack of control.
And those two things
made the risk more than it was.
As the novelty wore off
and the months went by,
there was some amount of tolerance;
people got used to it.
There was no new data,
but there was less fear.
By autumn,
people thought the doctors
should have solved this already.
And there's kind of a bifurcation:
people had to choose
between fear and acceptance --
actually, fear and indifference --
and they kind of chose suspicion.
And when the vaccine appeared last winter,
there were a lot of people --
a surprising number --
who refused to get it.
And it's a nice example of how
people's feelings of security change,
how their model changes,
sort of wildly,
with no new information,
with no new input.
This kind of thing happens a lot.
I'm going to give one more complication.
We have feeling, model, reality.
I have a very relativistic
view of security.
I think it depends on the observer.
And most security decisions
have a variety of people involved.
And stakeholders with specific trade-offs
will try to influence the decision.
And I call that their agenda.
And you see agenda --
this is marketing, this is politics --
trying to convince you to have
one model versus another,
trying to convince you to ignore a model
and trust your feelings,
marginalizing people
with models you don't like.
This is not uncommon.
An example, a great example,
is the risk of smoking.
In the history of the past 50 years,
the smoking risk shows
how a model changes,
and it also shows how an industry fights
against a model it doesn't like.
Compare that to the secondhand
smoke debate --
probably about 20 years behind.
Think about seat belts.
When I was a kid, no one wore a seat belt.
Nowadays, no kid will let you drive
if you're not wearing a seat belt.
Compare that to the airbag debate,
probably about 30 years behind.
All examples of models changing.
What we learn is that changing
models is hard.
Models are hard to dislodge.
If they equal your feelings,
you don't even know you have a model.
And there's another cognitive bias
I'll call confirmation bias,
where we tend to accept data
that confirms our beliefs
and reject data
that contradicts our beliefs.
So evidence against our model,
we're likely to ignore,
even if it's compelling.
It has to get very compelling
before we'll pay attention.
New models that extend
long periods of time are hard.
Global warming is a great example.
We're terrible at models
that span 80 years.
We can do "to the next harvest."
We can often do "until our kids grow up."
But "80 years," we're just not good at.
So it's a very hard model to accept.
We can have both models
in our head simultaneously --
that kind of problem where
we're holding both beliefs together,
the cognitive dissonance.
Eventually, the new model
will replace the old model.
Strong feelings can create a model.
September 11 created a security model
in a lot of people's heads.
Also, personal experiences
with crime can do it,
personal health scare,
a health scare in the news.
You'll see these called
"flashbulb events" by psychiatrists.
They can create a model instantaneously,
because they're very emotive.
So in the technological world,
we don't have experience to judge models.
And we rely on others. We rely on proxies.
And this works, as long as
it's the correct others.
We rely on government agencies
to tell us what pharmaceuticals are safe.
I flew here yesterday.
I didn't check the airplane.
I relied on some other group
to determine whether
my plane was safe to fly.
We're here, none of us fear the roof
is going to collapse on us,
not because we checked,
but because we're pretty sure
the building codes here are good.
It's a model we just accept
pretty much by faith.
And that's OK.
Now, what we want is people
to get familiar enough with better models,
have it reflected in their feelings,
to allow them to make security trade-offs.
When these go out of whack,
you have two options.
One, you can fix people's feelings,
directly appeal to feelings.
It's manipulation, but it can work.
The second, more honest way
is to actually fix the model.
Change happens slowly.
The smoking debate took 40 years --
and that was an easy one.
Some of this stuff is hard.
Really, though, information
seems like our best hope.
And I lied.
Remember I said feeling, model, reality;
reality doesn't change?
It actually does.
We live in a technological world;
reality changes all the time.
So we might have,
for the first time in our species:
feeling chases model, model chases
reality, reality's moving --
they might never catch up.
We don't know.
But in the long term,
both feeling and reality are important.
And I want to close with two quick
stories to illustrate this.
1982 -- I don't know if people
will remember this --
there was a short epidemic
of Tylenol poisonings
in the United States.
It's a horrific story.
Someone took a bottle of Tylenol,
put poison in it, closed it up,
put it back on the shelf,
someone else bought it and died.
This terrified people.
There were a couple of copycat attacks.
There wasn't any real risk,
but people were scared.
And this is how the tamper-proof
drug industry was invented.
Those tamper-proof caps?
That came from this.
It's complete security theater.
As a homework assignment,
think of 10 ways to get around it.
I'll give you one: a syringe.
But it made people feel better.
It made their feeling of security
more match the reality.
Last story: a few years ago,
a friend of mine gave birth.
I visit her in the hospital.
It turns out, when a baby's born now,
they put an RFID bracelet on the baby,
a corresponding one on the mother,
so if anyone other than the mother takes
the baby out of the maternity ward,
an alarm goes off.
I said, "Well, that's kind of neat.
I wonder how rampant
baby snatching is out of hospitals."
I go home, I look it up.
It basically never happens.
(Laughter)
But if you think about it,
if you are a hospital,
and you need to take a baby
away from its mother,
out of the room to run some tests,
you better have some good
security theater,
or she's going to rip your arm off.
(Laughter)
So it's important for us,
those of us who design security,
who look at security policy --
or even look at public policy
in ways that affect security.
It's not just reality;
it's feeling and reality.
What's important
is that they be about the same.
It's important that,
if our feelings match reality,
we make better security trade-offs.
Thank you.
(Applause)
There are a lot of ways
the people around us
can help improve our lives.
We don't bump into every neighbor,
so a lot of wisdom never gets passed on,
though we do share the same public spaces.
So over the past few years,
I've tried ways to share more
with my neighbors in public space,
using simple tools like
stickers, stencils and chalk.
And these projects came
from questions I had, like:
How much are my neighbors
paying for their apartments?
(Laughter)
How can we lend and borrow more things,
without knocking on each
other's doors at a bad time?
How can we share more memories
of our abandoned buildings,
and gain a better understanding
of our landscape?
How can we share more of our hopes
for our vacant storefronts,
so our communities can reflect
our needs and dreams today?
Now, I live in New Orleans,
and I am in love with New Orleans.
My soul is always soothed
by the giant live oak trees,
shading lovers, drunks and dreamers
for hundreds of years,
and I trust a city that always
makes way for music.
I feel like every time someone sneezes,
New Orleans has a parade.
(Laughter)
The city has some of the most
beautiful architecture in the world,
but it also has one of the highest amounts
of abandoned properties in America.
I live near this house,
and I thought about how I could
make it a nicer space for my neighborhood,
and I also thought about something
that changed my life forever.
In 2009, I lost someone I loved very much.
Her name was Joan,
and she was a mother to me.
And her death was sudden and unexpected.
And I thought about death a lot.
And ... this made me feel deep
gratitude for the time I've had.
And ... brought clarity to the things
that are meaningful to my life now.
But I struggle to maintain
this perspective in my daily life.
I feel like it's easy to get
caught up in the day-to-day,
and forget what really matters to you.
So with help from old and new friends,
I turned the side of this abandoned
house into a giant chalkboard,
and stenciled it with
a fill-in-the-blank sentence:
"Before I die, I want to ..."
So anyone walking by
can pick up a piece of chalk,
reflect on their life,
and share their personal
aspirations in public space.
I didn't know what to expect
from this experiment,
but by the next day,
the wall was entirely filled out,
and it kept growing.
And I'd like to share a few things
that people wrote on this wall.
"Before I die, I want
to be tried for piracy."
(Laughter)
"Before I die, I want to straddle
the International Dateline."
"Before I die, I want
to sing for millions."
"Before I die, I want to plant a tree."
"Before I die, I want
to live off the grid."
"Before I die, I want
to hold her one more time."
"Before I die, I want
to be someone's cavalry."
"Before I die, I want
to be completely myself."
So this neglected space
became a constructive one,
and people's hopes and dreams
made me laugh out loud, tear up,
and they consoled me
during my own tough times.
It's about knowing you're not alone;
it's about understanding our neighbors
in new and enlightening ways;
it's about making space
for reflection and contemplation,
and remembering what really matters
most to us as we grow and change.
I made this last year,
and started receiving hundreds
of messages from passionate people
who wanted to make a wall
with their community.
So, my civic center colleagues
and I made a tool kit,
and now walls have been made
in countries around the world,
including Kazakhstan,
South Africa,
Australia,
Argentina, and beyond.
Together, we've shown how powerful
our public spaces can be
if we're given the opportunity
to have a voice,
and share more with one another.
Two of the most valuable things we have
are time, and our relationships
with other people.
In our age of increasing distractions,
it's more important than ever
to find ways to maintain perspective,
and remember that life
is brief and tender.
Death is something that we're
often discouraged to talk about,
or even think about,
but I've realized that preparing for death
is one of the most empowering
things you can do.
Thinking about death clarifies your life.
Our shared spaces can better
reflect what matters to us,
as individuals and as a community,
and with more ways to share
our hopes, fears and stories,
the people around us can not only
help us make better places,
they can help us lead better lives.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Thank you.
(Applause)
Ever since I was a young girl,
I was always fascinated --
(Laughter)
Oh!
(Laughter)
OK, I meant younger and more short.
(Laughter)
If that's possible to imagine.
But ever since I was a young girl,
I was always fascinated with how
the world worked exactly how it did.
So this, very early on,
led me to the fields
of mathematics and chemistry.
I would keep going further and further,
and as I kept going,
I realized that all the fields
of science are interconnected.
And without one, the others
have little or no value.
So, inspired by Marie Curie
and my local science museum,
I decided to start asking
these questions myself
and engage in my own independent research,
whether it be out
of my garage or my bedroom.
I started reading journal papers,
started doing science competitions,
started participating in science fairs,
doing anything I could
to get the knowledge
that I so desperately wanted.
So while I was studying anatomy
for a competition,
I came across the topic
of something called chronic wounds.
And one thing that stood out
to me was a statistic
that said that the number of people
in the United States with chronic wounds
exceeds the number of people
with breast cancer,
colon cancer, lung cancer
and leukemia, combined.
Hold up.
So what is a chronic wound?
(Laughter)
And why haven't I heard
about a 5K walk for chronic wounds,
why haven't I even heard
about a chronic wound in general?
(Laughter)
So after I got past
those preliminary questions,
and one that I will clarify for you,
a chronic wound is essentially
when someone gets a normal wound,
except it fails to heal normally
because the patient has some kind
of preexisting condition,
which in most cases is diabetes.
So more staggering statistics
were to be found
as I kept going on in this research.
In the year 2010 alone,
50 billion dollars were spent worldwide
to treat chronic wounds.
In addition, it's estimated
that about two percent of the population
will get a chronic wound
at some point in their lifetime.
This was absurd.
So as I started doing more research,
I found that there was a correlation
between the moisture level
inside a wound dressing
and the stage of healing
that the chronic wound would be at.
So I decided, why don't I design something
to measure the moisture level
within the wound
so this can help doctors and patients
treat their wounds better.
And essentially, expedite
the healing process.
So that's exactly what I set out to do.
Being a 14-year-old working
out of her garage-turned-lab,
I had a lot of constraints.
Most being that I wasn't given a grant,
I wasn't given a lot of money,
and I wasn't given a lot of resources.
In addition, I had
a lot of criteria, as well.
Since this product would be
readily interacting with the body,
it had to be biocompatible,
it also had to be low-cost,
as I was designing it
and paying for it myself.
It also had to be mass-manufacturable,
because I wanted it to be made
anywhere, for anyone.
Thus, I drafted up a schematic.
What you see on the left hand-side
is the early schematics in my design,
showing both a bird's-eye view
and also one stacking variant.
A stacking variant means
that the entire product is consisted
of different individual parts
that have to work in unison.
And what's shown there
is one possible arrangement.
So what exactly is this?
So I had gone on to testing my sensors
and as all scientists have
stumbles along their work,
I also had a couple of problems
in my first generation of sensors.
First of all, I couldn't figure out
how to get a nanoparticle ink
into a printcheck cartridge
without spilling it all over my carpet.
That was problem number one.
Problem number two was,
I couldn't exactly control
the sensitivity of my sensors.
I couldn't scale them up or down,
I couldn't really do
anything of that sort.
So I wanted something to solve it.
Problem one was easily solved
by some scouting on eBay and Amazon
for syringes that I could use.
Problem two, however,
required a lot more thought.
So this is where this factors in.
So what a space-filling curve does
is it aims to take up all the area it can
within one unit square.
And by writing a computer program,
you can have different iterations
of the different curve,
which increasingly get close
to one unit square,
but never quite reaches there.
So now I could control
the thickness, the size,
I could do whatever I want with it,
and I could predict my results.
So I started constructing my sensors
and testing them more rigorously,
using money that I had gotten
from previous science fair awards.
Lastly, I had to connect this data
in order to be read.
So I interfaced it with a Bluetooth chip,
which you can see here
by the app screenshots on the right.
And what this does is that anyone
can monitor the progress of their wound,
and it can be transmitted
over a wireless connection
to the doctor, the patient
or whoever needs it.
[Continued Testing and Refinement]
So in conclusion, my design
was successful --
however, science never ends.
There's always something to be done,
something to be refined.
So that's what I'm currently
in the process of doing.
However, what I learned was
what's more important
than the actual thing I designed
is an attitude that I had
taken on while doing this.
And that attitude was,
even though I'm a 14-year-old
working in her garage
on something that she doesn't
completely understand,
I could still make a difference
and contribute to the field.
And that's what inspired me to keep going,
and I hope it inspires many others
to also do work like this
even though they're not
very sure about it.
So I hope that's a message
that you all take on today.
Thank you.
(Applause)
This story
is about taking imagination seriously.
Fourteen years ago,
I first encountered this ordinary material, fishnet,
used the same way for centuries.
Today, I'm using it to create
permanent, billowing, voluptuous forms
the scale of hard-edged buildings
in cities around the world.
I was an unlikely person to be doing this.
I never studied sculpture,
engineering or architecture.
In fact, after college
I applied to seven art schools
and was rejected by all seven.
I went off on my own to become an artist,
and I painted for 10 years,
when I was offered a Fulbright to India.
Promising to give exhibitions of paintings,
I shipped my paints and arrived in Mahabalipuram.
The deadline for the show arrived --
my paints didn't.
I had to do something.
This fishing village was famous for sculpture.
So I tried bronze casting.
But to make large forms was too heavy and expensive.
I went for a walk on the beach,
watching the fishermen
bundle their nets into mounds on the sand.
I'd seen it every day,
but this time I saw it differently --
a new approach to sculpture,
a way to make volumetric form
without heavy solid materials.
My first satisfying sculpture
was made in collaboration with these fishermen.
It's a self-portrait
titled "Wide Hips."
(Laughter)
We hoisted them on poles to photograph.
I discovered
their soft surfaces
revealed every ripple of wind
in constantly changing patterns.
I was mesmerized.
I continued studying craft traditions
and collaborating with artisans,
next in Lithuania with lace makers.
I liked the fine detail
it gave my work,
but I wanted to make them larger --
to shift from being an object you look at
to something you could get lost in.
Returning to India to work with those fishermen,
we made a net
of a million and a half hand-tied knots --
installed briefly in Madrid.
Thousands of people saw it,
and one of them was the urbanist
Manual Sola-Morales
who was redesigning the waterfront
in Porto, Portugal.
He asked if I could build this
as a permanent piece for the city.
I didn't know if I could do that
and preserve my art.
Durable, engineered, permanent --
those are in opposition
to idiosyncratic, delicate and ephemeral.
For two years, I searched for a fiber
that could survive ultraviolet rays,
salt, air, pollution,
and at the same time remain soft enough
to move fluidly in the wind.
We needed something to hold the net up
out there in the middle of the traffic circle.
So we raised this 45,000-pound steel ring.
We had to engineer it
to move gracefully in an average breeze
and survive in hurricane winds.
But there was no engineering software
to model something porous and moving.
I found a brilliant aeronautical engineer
who designs sails for America's Cup racing yachts
named Peter Heppel.
He helped me tackle the twin challenges
of precise shape
and gentle movement.
I couldn't build this the way I knew
because hand-tied knots
weren't going to withstand a hurricane.
So I developed a relationship
with an industrial fishnet factory,
learned the variables of their machines,
and figured out a way
to make lace with them.
There was no language
to translate this ancient, idiosyncratic handcraft
into something machine operators could produce.
So we had to create one.
Three years and two children later,
we raised this 50,000-square-foot lace net.
It was hard to believe
that what I had imagined
was now built, permanent
and had lost nothing in translation.
(Applause)
This intersection had been bland and anonymous.
Now it had a sense of place.
I walked underneath it
for the first time.
As I watched the wind's choreography unfold,
I felt sheltered
and, at the same time,
connected to limitless sky.
My life was not going to be the same.
I want to create these oases of sculpture
in spaces of cities around the world.
I'm going to share two directions
that are new in my work.
Historic Philadelphia City Hall:
its plaza, I felt, needed a material for sculpture
that was lighter than netting.
So we experimented
with tiny atomized water particles
to create a dry mist
that is shaped by the wind
and in testing, discovered
that it can be shaped by people
who can interact and move through it without getting wet.
I'm using this sculpture material
to trace the paths of subway trains above ground
in real time --
like an X-ray of the city's circulatory system unfolding.
Next challenge,
the Biennial of the Americas in Denver
asked, could I represent
the 35 nations of the Western hemisphere and their interconnectedness
in a sculpture?
(Laughter)
I didn't know where to begin,
but I said yes.
I read about the recent earthquake in Chile
and the tsunami that rippled across
the entire Pacific Ocean.
It shifted the Earth's tectonic plates,
sped up the planet's rotation
and literally shortened the length of the day.
So I contacted NOAA,
and I asked if they'd share their data on the tsunami,
and translated it into this.
Its title: "1.26"
refers to the number of microseconds
that the Earth's day was shortened.
I couldn't build this with a steel ring, the way I knew.
Its shape was too complex now.
So I replaced the metal armature
with a soft, fine mesh
of a fiber 15 times stronger than steel.
The sculpture could now be entirely soft,
which made it so light
it could tie in to existing buildings --
literally becoming part of the fabric of the city.
There was no software
that could extrude these complex net forms
and model them with gravity.
So we had to create it.
Then I got a call from New York City
asking if I could adapt these concepts
to Times Square
or the High Line.
This new soft structural method
enables me to model these
and build these sculptures
at the scale of skyscrapers.
They don't have funding yet,
but I dream now
of bringing these to cities around the world
where they're most needed.
Fourteen years ago,
I searched for beauty
in the traditional things,
in craft forms.
Now I combine them with hi-tech materials and engineering
to create voluptuous, billowing forms
the scale of buildings.
My artistic horizons continue to grow.
I'll leave you with this story.
I got a call from a friend in Phoenix.
An attorney in the office
who'd never been interested in art,
never visited the local art museum,
dragged everyone she could from the building
and got them outside to lie down underneath the sculpture.
There they were in their business suits,
laying in the grass,
noticing the changing patterns of wind
beside people they didn't know,
sharing the rediscovery of wonder.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you.
(Applause)
So yeah, I'm a newspaper cartoonist --
political cartoonist.
I don't know if you've heard about it -- newspapers?
It's a sort of paper-based reader.
(Laughter)
It's lighter than an iPad,
it's a bit cheaper.
You know what they say?
They say the print media is dying --
who says that? Well, the media.
But this is no news, right?
You've read about it already.
(Laughter)
Ladies and gentlemen,
the world has gotten smaller.
I know it's a cliche, but look,
look how small,
how tiny it has gotten.
And you know the reason why, of course.
This is because of technology -- yeah.
(Laughter)
Any computer designers in the room?
Yeah well,
you guys are making my life miserable
because track pads used to be round,
a nice round shape.
That makes a good cartoon.
But what are you going to do with a flat track pad,
those square things?
There's nothing I can do as a cartoonist.
Well, I know the world is flat now.
That's true.
And the Internet has reached
every corner of the world,
the poorest, the remotest places.
Every village in Africa now has a cyber cafe.
(Laughter)
Don't go asking for a Frappuccino there.
So we are bridging the digital divide.
The Third World is connected,
we are connected.
And what happens next?
Well, you've got mail.
Yeah.
Well, the Internet has empowered us.
It has empowered you,
it has empowered me
and it has empowered some other guys as well.
(Laughter)
You know, these last two cartoons --
I did them live
during a conference in Hanoi.
And they were not used to that
in communist 2.0 Vietnam.
(Laughter)
So I was cartooning live on a wide screen --
it was quite a sensation --
and then this guy came to me.
He was taking pictures of me and of my sketches,
and I thought, "This is great, a Vietnamese fan."
And as he came the second day,
I thought, "Wow, that's really a cartoon lover."
And on the third day, I finally understood,
the guy was actually on duty.
So by now, there must be a hundred pictures of me
smiling with my sketches
in the files of the Vietnamese police.
(Laughter)
No, but it's true: the Internet has changed the world.
It has rocked the music industry;
it has changed the way we consume music.
For those of you old enough to remember,
we used to have to go to the store
to steal it.
(Laughter)
And it has changed the way
your future employer
will look at your application.
So be careful
with that Facebook account --
your momma told you, be careful.
And technology has set us free --
this is free WiFi.
But yeah, it has liberated us
from the office desk.
This is your life,
enjoy it.
(Laughter)
In short, technology, the internet,
they have changed our lifestyle.
Tech guru, like this man --
that a German magazine called the philosopher of the 21st century --
they are shaping the way we do things.
They are shaping the way we consume.
They are shaping our very desires.
(Laughter)
(Applause)
You will not like it.
And technology has even changed
our relationship to God.
(Laughter)
Now I shouldn't get into this.
Religion and political cartoons,
as you may have heard,
make a difficult couple,
ever since that day of 2005,
when a bunch of cartoonists in Denmark
drew cartoons that had repercussions all over the world --
demonstrations, fatwa,
they provoked violence. People died in the violence.
This was so sickening;
people died because of cartoons.
I mean --
I had the feeling at the time
that cartoons had been used by both sides, actually.
They were used first by a Danish newspaper,
which wanted to make a point on Islam.
A Danish cartoonist told me he was one of the 24
who received the assignment to draw the prophet --
12 of them refused. Did you know that?
He told me, "Nobody has to tell me what I should draw.
This is not how it works."
And then, of course, they were used
by extremists and politicians on the other side.
They wanted to stir up controversy.
You know the story.
We know that cartoons can be used as weapons.
History tells us,
they've been used by the Nazis
to attack the Jews.
And here we are now.
In the United Nations,
half of the world is pushing
to penalize the offense to religion --
they call it the defamation of religion --
while the other half of the world is fighting back
in defense of freedom of speech.
So the clash of civilizations is here,
and cartoons are at the middle of it?
This got me thinking.
Now you see me thinking
at my kitchen table,
and since you're in my kitchen,
please meet my wife.
(Laughter)
In 2006, a few months after,
I went Ivory Coast --
Western Africa.
Now, talk of a divided place -- the country was cut in two.
You had a rebellion in the North,
the government in the South -- the capital, Abidjan --
and in the middle, the French army.
This looks like a giant hamburger.
You don't want to be the ham in the middle.
I was there to report on that story
in cartoons.
I've been doing this for the last 15 years;
it's my side job, if you want.
So you see the style is different.
This is more serious than maybe editorial cartooning.
I went to places like Gaza
during the war in 2009.
So this is really journalism in cartoons.
You'll hear more and more about it.
This is the future of journalism, I think.
And of course, I went to see the rebels in the north.
Those were poor guys fighting for their rights.
There was an ethnic side to this conflict
as very often in Africa.
And I went to see the Dozo.
The Dozo, they are the traditional hunters
of West Africa.
People fear them --
they help the rebellion a lot.
They are believed to have magical powers.
They can disappear and escape bullets.
I went to see a Dozo chief;
he told me about his magical powers.
He said, "I can chop your head off right away
and bring you back to life."
I said, "Well, maybe we don't have time for this right now."
(Laughter)
"Another time."
So back in Abidjan,
I was given a chance to lead a workshop
with local cartoonists there
and I thought, yes,
in a context like this, cartoons can really be used as weapons
against the other side.
I mean, the press in Ivory Coast was bitterly divided --
it was compared to the media in Rwanda
before the genocide --
so imagine.
And what can a cartoonist do?
Sometimes editors would tell their cartoonists
to draw what they wanted to see,
and the guy has to feed his family, right?
So the idea was pretty simple.
We brought together cartoonists
from all sides in Ivory Coast.
We took them away from their newspaper for three days.
And I asked them to do a project together,
tackle the issues affecting their country
in cartoons, yes, in cartoons.
Show the positive power of cartoons.
It's a great tool of communication
for bad or for good.
And cartoons can cross boundaries,
as you have seen.
And humor is a good way, I think,
to address serious issues.
And I'm very proud of what they did.
I mean, they didn't agree with each other -- that was not the point.
And I didn't ask them to do nice cartoons.
The first day, they were even shouting at each other.
But they came up with a book,
looking back at 13 years
of political crisis in Ivory Coast.
So the idea was there.
And I've been doing projects like this,
in 2009 in Lebanon,
this year in Kenya, back in January.
In Lebanon, it was not a book.
The idea was to have --
the same principal, a divided country --
take cartoonists from all sides
and let them do something together.
So in Lebanon,
we enrolled the newspaper editors,
and we got them to publish
eight cartoonists from all sides all together on the same page,
addressing the issue affecting Lebanon,
like religion in politics and everyday life.
And it worked.
For three days, almost all the newspapers of Beirut
published all those cartoonists together --
anti-government,
pro-government,
Christian,
Muslim, of course,
English-speaking, well, you name it.
So this was a great project.
And then in Kenya, what we did
was addressing the issue of ethnicity,
which is a poison in a lot of places in Africa.
And we did video clips --
you can see them if you go to YouTube/Kenyatoons.
So, preaching for freedom of speech
is easy here,
but as you have seen
in contexts of repression or division,
again, what can a cartoonist do?
He has to keep his job.
Well I believe that in any context anywhere,
he always has the choice at least
not to do a cartoon
that will feed hatred.
And that's the message I try to convey to them.
I think we all always have the choice in the end
not to do the bad thing.
But we need to support
these [unclear], critical
and responsible voices
in Africa, in Lebanon,
in your local newspaper,
in the Apple store.
Today, tech companies
are the world's largest editors.
They decide what is too offensive
or too provocative for you to see.
So really, it's not about the freedom of cartoonists;
it's about your freedoms.
And for dictators all over the world,
the good news
is when cartoonists,
journalists and activists shut up.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Isadora Duncan --
(Music) --
crazy, long-legged woman
from San Francisco,
got tired of this country,
and she wanted to get out.
Isadora was famous
somewhere around 1908
for putting up a blue curtain,
and she would stand
with her hands over her solar plexus
and she would wait,
and she would wait,
and then, she would move.
(Music)
Josh and I and Somi call this piece
"The Red Circle and the Blue Curtain."
Red circle.
Blue curtain.
But,
this is not the beginning
of the 20th century.
This is a morning in Vancouver
in 2015.
(Music)
(Singing)
Come on, Josh!
(Music)
(Singing)
Go!
Are we there yet?
I don't think so.
Hey, yeah!
(Music)
What time is it?
(Music)
Where are we?
Josh.
Somi.
Bill T.
Josh.
Somi.
Bill T.
(Applause)
Yeah, yeah!
So we humans have an extraordinary
potential for goodness,
but also an immense power to do harm.
Any tool can be used to build
or to destroy.
That all depends on our motivation.
Therefore, it is all the more important
to foster an altruistic motivation
rather than a selfish one.
So now we indeed are facing 
many challenges in our times.
Those could be personal challenges.
Our own mind can be our best friend
or our worst enemy.
There's also societal challenges:
poverty in the midst of plenty,
inequalities, conflict, injustice.
And then there are the new challenges,
which we don't expect.
Ten thousand years ago, there were
about five million human beings on Earth.
Whatever they could do,
the Earth's resilience 
would soon heal human activities.
After the Industrial
and Technological Revolutions,
that's not the same anymore.
We are now the major agent
of impact on our Earth.
We enter the Anthropocene,
the era of human beings.
So in a way, if we were to say
we need to continue this endless growth,
endless use of material resources,
it's like if this man was saying --
and I heard a former head of state,
I won't mention who, saying --
"Five years ago, we were at
the edge of the precipice.
Today we made a big step forward."
So this edge is the same
that has been defined by scientists
as the planetary boundaries.
And within those boundaries,
they can carry a number of factors.
We can still prosper, humanity can still
prosper for 150,000 years
if we keep the same stability of climate
as in the Holocene
for the last 10,000 years.
But this depends on choosing
a voluntary simplicity,
growing qualitatively, not quantitatively.
So in 1900, as you can see,
we were well within the limits of safety.
Now, in 1950 came the great acceleration.
Now hold your breath, not too long,
to imagine what comes next.
Now we have vastly overrun
some of the planetary boundaries.
Just to take biodiversity, 
at the current rate,
by 2050, 30 percent of all species 
on Earth will have disappeared.
Even if we keep their DNA in some fridge,
that's not going to be reversible.
So here I am sitting
in front of a 7,000-meter-high, 
21,000-foot glacier in Bhutan.
At the Third Pole, 2,000 glaciers
are melting fast, faster than the Arctic.
So what can we do in that situation?
Well, however complex
politically, economically, scientifically
the question of the environment is,
it simply boils down to a question
of altruism versus selfishness.
I'm a Marxist of the Groucho tendency.
(Laughter)
Groucho Marx said, "Why should I care
about future generations?
What have they ever done for me?"
(Laughter)
Unfortunately, I heard
the billionaire Steve Forbes,
on Fox News, saying exactly 
the same thing, but seriously.
He was told about the rise of the ocean,
and he said, "I find it absurd
to change my behavior today
for something that will happen 
in a hundred years."
So if you don't care
for future generations,
just go for it.
So one of the main challenges of our times
is to reconcile three time scales:
the short term of the economy,
the ups and downs of the stock market,
the end-of-the-year accounts;
the midterm of the quality of life --
what is the quality every moment of our 
life, over 10 years and 20 years? --
and the long term of the environment.
When the environmentalists
speak with economists,
it's like a schizophrenic dialogue,
completely incoherent.
They don't speak the same language.
Now, for the last 10 years,
I went around the world
meeting economists, scientists,
neuroscientists, environmentalists,
philosophers, thinkers 
in the Himalayas, all over the place.
It seems to me, there's only one concept
that can reconcile
those three time scales.
It is simply having more
consideration for others.
If you have more consideration for others,
you will have a caring economics,
where finance is at the service of society
and not society at the service of finance.
You will not play at the casino
with the resources that people
have entrusted you with.
If you have more consideration for others,
you will make sure
that you remedy inequality,
that you bring some kind 
of well-being within society,
in education, at the workplace.
Otherwise, a nation that is
the most powerful and the richest
but everyone is miserable,
what's the point?
And if you have more
consideration for others,
you are not going to ransack
that planet that we have
and at the current rate, we don't
have three planets to continue that way.
So the question is,
okay, altruism is the answer,
it's not just a novel ideal,
but can it be a real, pragmatic solution?
And first of all, does it exist,
true altruism, or are we so selfish?
So some philosophers thought
we were irredeemably selfish.
But are we really all just like rascals?
That's good news, isn't it?
Many philosophers, 
like Hobbes, have said so.
But not everyone looks like a rascal.
Or is man a wolf for man?
But this guy doesn't seem too bad.
He's one of my friends in Tibet.
He's very kind.
So now, we love cooperation.
There's no better joy 
than working together, is there?
And then not only humans.
Then, of course, there's
the struggle for life,
the survival of the fittest,
social Darwinism.
But in evolution, cooperation --
though competition exists, of course --
cooperation has to be much more creative
to go to increased levels of complexity.
We are super-cooperators 
and we should even go further.
So now, on top of that,
the quality of human relationships.
The OECD did a survey among 10 factors,
including income, everything.
The first one that people said,
that's the main thing for my happiness,
is quality of social relationships.
Not only in humans.
And look at those great-grandmothers.
So now, this idea 
that if we go deep within,
we are irredeemably selfish,
this is armchair science.
There is not a single sociological study,
psychological study,
that's ever shown that.
Rather, the opposite.
My friend, Daniel Batson, 
spent a whole life
putting people in the lab
in very complex situations.
And of course we are sometimes selfish,
and some people more than others.
But he found that systematically,
no matter what,
there's a significant number of people
who do behave altruistically,
no matter what.
If you see someone
deeply wounded, great suffering,
you might just help
out of empathic distress --
you can't stand it, so it's better to help
than to keep on looking at that person.
So we tested all that, and in the end, 
he said, clearly people can be altruistic.
So that's good news.
And even further, we should look
at the banality of goodness.
Now look at here.
When we come out, we aren't 
going to say, "That's so nice.
There was no fistfight while this mob 
was thinking about altruism."
No, that's expected, isn't it?
If there was a fistfight,
we would speak of that for months.
So the banality of goodness is something
that doesn't attract your attention,
but it exists.
Now, look at this.
So some psychologists said,
when I tell them I run 140 humanitarian 
projects in the Himalayas
that give me so much joy,
they said, "Oh, I see,
you work for the warm glow.
That is not altruistic.
You just feel good."
You think this guy,
when he jumped in front of the train,
he thought, "I'm going to feel
so good when this is over?"
(Laughter)
But that's not the end of it.
They say, well, but when
you interviewed him, he said,
"I had no choice.
I had to jump, of course."
He has no choice. Automatic behavior.
It's neither selfish nor altruistic.
No choice?
Well of course, this guy's
not going to think for half an hour,
"Should I give my hand? Not give my hand?"
He does it. There is a choice,
but it's obvious, it's immediate.
And then, also, there he had a choice.
(Laughter)
There are people who had choice,
like Pastor André Trocmé and his wife,
and the whole village
of Le Chambon-sur-Lignon in France.
For the whole Second World War,
they saved 3,500 Jews,
gave them shelter,
brought them to Switzerland,
against all odds, at the risk
of their lives and those of their family.
So altruism does exist.
So what is altruism?
It is the wish: May others be happy
and find the cause of happiness.
Now, empathy is the affective resonance
or cognitive resonance that tells you,
this person is joyful,
this person suffers.
But empathy alone is not sufficient.
If you keep on being
confronted with suffering,
you might have empathic distress, burnout,
so you need the greater sphere
of loving-kindness.
With Tania Singer at the Max Planck 
Institute of Leipzig,
we showed that the brain networks for
empathy and loving-kindness are different.
Now, that's all well done,
so we got that from evolution,
from maternal care, parental love,
but we need to extend that.
It can be extended even to other species.
Now, if we want a more altruistic society,
we need two things:
individual change and societal change.
So is individual change possible?
Two thousand years
of contemplative study said yes, it is.
Now, 15 years of collaboration
with neuroscience and epigenetics
said yes, our brains change
when you train in altruism.
So I spent 120 hours in an MRI machine.
This is the first time I went
after two and a half hours.
And then the result has been published
in many scientific papers.
It shows without ambiguity
that there is structural change
and functional change in the brain
when you train the altruistic love.
Just to give you an idea:
this is the meditator at rest on the left,
meditator in compassion meditation,
you see all the activity,
and then the control group at rest,
nothing happened,
in meditation, nothing happened.
They have not been trained.
So do you need 50,000 hours 
of meditation? No, you don't.
Four weeks, 20 minutes a day,
of caring, mindfulness meditation
already brings a structural change
in the brain compared to a control group.
That's only 20 minutes a day
for four weeks.
Even with preschoolers --
Richard Davidson did that in Madison.
An eight-week program: gratitude, loving-
kindness, cooperation, mindful breathing.
You would say, 
"Oh, they're just preschoolers."
Look after eight weeks,
the pro-social behavior,
that's the blue line.
And then comes the ultimate
scientific test, the stickers test.
Before, you determine for each child
who is their best friend in the class,
their least favorite child,
an unknown child, and the sick child,
and they have to give stickers away.
So before the intervention,
they give most of it to their best friend.
Four, five years old, 
20 minutes three times a week.
After the intervention,
no more discrimination:
the same amount of stickers to their 
best friend and the least favorite child.
That's something we should do
in all the schools in the world.
Now where do we go from there?
(Applause)
When the Dalai Lama heard that,
he told Richard Davidson,
"You go to 10 schools, 100 schools,
the U.N., the whole world."
So now where do we go from there?
Individual change is possible.
Now do we have to wait for an altruistic 
gene to be in the human race?
That will take 50,000 years,
too much for the environment.
Fortunately, there is
the evolution of culture.
Cultures, as specialists have shown,
change faster than genes.
That's the good news.
Look, attitude towards war
has dramatically changed over the years.
So now individual change and cultural 
change mutually fashion each other,
and yes, we can achieve
a more altruistic society.
So where do we go from there?
Myself, I will go back to the East.
Now we treat 100,000 patients
a year in our projects.
We have 25,000 kids in school,
four percent overhead.
Some people say, "Well,
your stuff works in practice,
but does it work in theory?"
There's always positive deviance.
So I will also go back to my hermitage
to find the inner resources
to better serve others.
But on the more global level,
what can we do?
We need three things.
Enhancing cooperation:
Cooperative learning in the school
instead of competitive learning,
Unconditional cooperation
within corporations --
there can be some competition
between corporations, but not within.
We need sustainable harmony.
I love this term.
Not sustainable growth anymore.
Sustainable harmony means now
we will reduce inequality.
In the future, we do more with less,
and we continue to grow qualitatively,
not quantitatively.
We need caring economics.
The Homo economicus cannot deal
with poverty in the midst of plenty,
cannot deal with the problem
of the common goods
of the atmosphere, of the oceans.
We need a caring economics.
If you say economics
should be compassionate,
they say, "That's not our job."
But if you say they don't care,
that looks bad.
We need local commitment,
global responsibility.
We need to extend altruism
to the other 1.6 million species.
Sentient beings 
are co-citizens in this world.
and we need to dare altruism.
So, long live the altruistic revolution.
Viva la revolución de altruismo.
(Applause)
Thank you.
(Applause)
Where does the end begin?
Well, for me, it all began
with this little fellow.
This adorable organism --
well, I think it's adorable --
is called Tetrahymena
and it's a single-celled creature.
It's also been known as pond scum.
So that's right, my career
started with pond scum.
Now, it was no surprise
I became a scientist.
Growing up far away from here,
as a little girl I was deadly curious
about everything alive.
I used to pick up lethally poisonous
stinging jellyfish and sing to them.
And so starting my career,
I was deadly curious
about fundamental mysteries
of the most basic building blocks of life,
and I was fortunate to live in a society
where that curiosity was valued.
Now, for me, this little
pond scum critter Tetrahymena
was a great way to study
the fundamental mystery
I was most curious about:
those bundles of DNA
in our cells called chromosomes.
And it was because I was curious
about the very ends of chromosomes,
known as telomeres.
Now, when I started my quest,
all we knew was that they helped
protect the ends of chromosomes.
It was important when cells divide.
It was really important,
but I wanted to find out
what telomeres consisted of,
and for that, I needed a lot of them.
And it so happens
that cute little Tetrahymena
has a lot of short linear chromosomes,
around 20,000,
so lots of telomeres.
And I discovered that telomeres
consisted of special segments
of noncoding DNA right
at the very ends of chromosomes.
But here's a problem.
Now, we all start life as a single cell.
It multiples to two.
Two becomes four. Four becomes eight,
and on and on to form
the 200 million billion cells
that make up our adult body.
And some of those cells
have to divide thousands of times.
In fact, even as I stand here before you,
all throughout my body,
cells are furiously replenishing
to, well, keep me
standing here before you.
So every time a cell divides,
all of its DNA has to be copied,
all of the coding DNA
inside of those chromosomes,
because that carries
the vital operating instructions
that keep our cells in good working order,
so my heart cells can keep a steady beat,
which I assure you
they're not doing right now,
and my immune cells
can fight off bacteria and viruses,
and our brain cells
can save the memory of our first kiss
and keep on learning throughout life.
But there is a glitch
in the way DNA is copied.
It is just one of those facts of life.
Every time the cell divides
and the DNA is copied,
some of that DNA from the ends
gets worn down and shortened,
some of that telomere DNA.
And think about it
like the protective caps
at the ends of your shoelace.
And those keep the shoelace,
or the chromosome, from fraying,
and when that tip
gets too short, it falls off,
and that worn down telomere
sends a signal to the cells.
"The DNA is no longer being protected."
It sends a signal. Time to die.
So, end of story.
Well, sorry, not so fast.
It can't be the end of the story,
because life hasn't died
off the face of the earth.
So I was curious:
if such wear and tear is inevitable,
how on earth does Mother Nature make sure
we can keep our chromosomes intact?
Now, remember that little
pond scum critter Tetrahymena?
The craziest thing was,
Tetrahymena cells never got old and died.
Their telomeres weren't shortening
as time marched on.
Sometimes they even got longer.
Something else was at work,
and believe me, that something
was not in any textbook.
So working in my lab with
my extraordinary student Carol Greider --
and Carol and I shared
the Nobel Prize for this work --
we began running experiments
and we discovered
cells do have something else.
It was a previously undreamed-of enzyme
that could replenish,
make longer, telomeres,
and we named it telomerase.
And when we removed
our pond scum's telomerase,
their telomeres ran down and they died.
So it was thanks
to their plentiful telomerase
that our pond scum critters never got old.
OK, now, that's
an incredibly hopeful message
for us humans to be
receiving from pond scum,
because it turns out
that as we humans age,
our telomeres do shorten,
and remarkably,
that shortening is aging us.
Generally speaking,
the longer your telomeres,
the better off you are.
It's the overshortening of telomeres
that leads us to feel and see
signs of aging.
My skin cells start to die
and I start to see fine lines, wrinkles.
Hair pigment cells die.
You start to see gray.
Immune system cells die.
You increase your risks of getting sick.
In fact, the cumulative research
from the last 20 years
has made clear that telomere attrition
is contributing to our risks
of getting cardiovascular diseases,
Alzheimer's, some cancers and diabetes,
the very conditions many of us die of.
And so we have to think about this.
What is going on?
This attrition,
we look and we feel older, yeah.
Our telomeres are losing
the war of attrition faster.
And those of us who feel youthful longer,
it turns out our telomeres
are staying longer
for longer periods of time,
extending our feelings of youthfulness
and reducing the risks
of all we most dread
as the birthdays go by.
OK,
seems like a no-brainer.
Now, if my telomeres are connected
to how quickly
I'm going to feel and get old,
if my telomeres can be
renewed by my telomerase,
then all I have to do to reverse
the signs and symptoms of aging
is figure out where to buy
that Costco-sized bottle
of grade A organic
fair trade telomerase, right?
Great! Problem solved.
(Applause)
Not so fast, I'm sorry.
Alas, that's not the case.
OK. And why?
It's because human genetics has taught us
that when it comes to our telomerase,
we humans live on a knife edge.
OK, simply put,
yes, nudging up telomerase
does decrease the risks of some diseases,
but it also increases the risks
of certain and rather nasty cancers.
So even if you could buy
that Costco-sized bottle of telomerase,
and there are many websites
marketing such dubious products,
the problem is you could
nudge up your risks of cancers.
And we don't want that.
Now, don't worry,
and because, while I think
it's kind of funny that right now,
you know, many of us may be thinking,
well, I'd rather be like pond scum.
(Laughter)
There is something for us humans
in the story of telomeres
and their maintenance.
But I want to get one thing clear.
It isn't about enormously
extending human lifespan
or immortality.
It's about health span.
Now, health span is the number
of years of your life
when you're free of disease,
you're healthy, you're productive,
you're zestfully enjoying life.
Disease span, the opposite of health span,
is the time of your life
spent feeling old and sick and dying.
So the real question becomes,
OK, if I can't guzzle telomerase,
do I have control
over my telomeres' length
and hence my well-being, my health,
without those downsides of cancer risks?
OK?
So, it's the year 2000.
Now, I've been minutely scrutinizing
little teeny tiny telomeres
very happily for many years,
when into my lab walks
a psychologist named Elissa Epel.
Now, Elissa's expertise is in the effects
of severe, chronic psychological stress
on our mind's and our body's health.
And there she was standing in my lab,
which ironically overlooked
the entrance to a mortuary, and --
(Laughter)
And she had a life-and-death
question for me.
"What happens to telomeres
in people who are chronically stressed?"
she asked me.
You see, she'd been studying caregivers,
and specifically mothers of children
with a chronic condition,
be it gut disorder,
be it autism, you name it --
a group obviously under enormous
and prolonged psychological stress.
I have to say, her question
changed me profoundly.
See, all this time
I had been thinking of telomeres
as those miniscule
molecular structures that they are,
and the genes that control telomeres.
And when Elissa asked me
about studying caregivers,
I suddenly saw telomeres
in a whole new light.
I saw beyond the genes and the chromosomes
into the lives of the real people
we were studying.
And I'm a mom myself,
and at that moment,
I was struck by the image of these women
dealing with a child with a condition
very difficult to deal with,
often without help.
And such women, simply,
often look worn down.
So was it possible their telomeres
were worn down as well?
So our collective curiosity
went into overdrive.
Elissa selected for our first study
a group of such caregiving mothers,
and we wanted to ask:
What's the length of their telomeres
compared with the number of years
that they have been caregiving
for their child with a chronic condition?
So four years go by
and the day comes
when all the results are in,
and Elissa looked down
at our first scatterplot
and literally gasped,
because there was a pattern to the data,
and it was the exact gradient
that we most feared might exist.
It was right there on the page.
The longer, the more years that is,
the mother had been
in this caregiving situation,
no matter her age,
the shorter were her telomeres.
And the more she perceived
her situation as being more stressful,
the lower was her telomerase
and the shorter were her telomeres.
So we had discovered something unheard of:
the more chronic stress you are under,
the shorter your telomeres,
meaning the more likely you were
to fall victim to an early disease span
and perhaps untimely death.
Our findings meant
that people's life events
and the way we respond to these events
can change how you
maintain your telomeres.
So telomere length wasn't
just a matter of age counted in years.
Elissa's question to me,
back when she first came to my lab,
indeed had been a life-and-death question.
Now, luckily, hidden
in that data there was hope.
We noticed that some mothers,
despite having been carefully caring
for their children for many years,
had been able to maintain their telomeres.
So studying these women closely revealed
that they were resilient to stress.
Somehow they were able
to experience their circumstances
not as a threat day in and day out
but as a challenge,
and this has led to a very important
insight for all of us:
we have control over the way we age
all the way down into our cells.
OK, now our initial curiosity
became infectious.
Thousands of scientists
from different fields
added their expertise
to telomere research,
and the findings have poured in.
It's up to over 10,000
scientific papers and counting.
So several studies
rapidly confirmed our initial finding
that yes, chronic stress
is bad for telomeres.
And now many are revealing
that we have more control
over this particular aging process
than any of us could ever have imagined.
A few examples:
a study from the University
of California, Los Angeles
of people who are caring
for a relative with dementia, long-term,
and looked at their caregiver's
telomere maintenance capacity
and found that it was improved
by them practicing a form of meditation
for as little as 12 minutes
a day for two months.
Attitude matters.
If you're habitually a negative thinker,
you typically see a stressful situation
with a threat stress response,
meaning if your boss wants to see you,
you automatically think,
"I'm about to be fired,"
and your blood vessels constrict,
and your level of the stress
hormone cortisol creeps up,
and then it stays up,
and over time, that persistently
high level of the cortisol
actually damps down your telomerase.
Not good for your telomeres.
On the other hand,
if you typically see something stressful
as a challenge to be tackled,
then blood flows to your heart
and to your brain,
and you experience a brief
but energizing spike of cortisol.
And thanks to that habitual
"bring it on" attitude,
your telomeres do just fine.
So ...
What is all of this telling us?
Your telomeres do just fine.
You really do have power
to change what is happening
to your own telomeres.
But our curiosity
just got more and more intense,
because we started to wonder,
what about factors outside our own skin?
Could they impact
our telomere maintenance as well?
You know, we humans
are intensely social beings.
Was it even possible
that our telomeres were social as well?
And the results have been startling.
As early as childhood,
emotional neglect, exposure to violence,
bullying and racism
all impact your telomeres,
and the effects are long-term.
Can you imagine the impact on children
of living years in a war zone?
People who can't trust their neighbors
and who don't feel safe
in their neighborhoods
consistently have shorter telomeres.
So your home address
matters for telomeres as well.
On the flip side,
tight-knit communities,
being in a marriage long-term,
and lifelong friendships, even,
all improve telomere maintenance.
So what is all this telling us?
It's telling us that I have the power
to impact my own telomeres,
and I also have the power to impact yours.
Telomere science has told us
just how interconnected we all are.
But I'm still curious.
I do wonder
what legacy all of us
will leave for the next generation?
Will we invest
in the next young woman or man
peering through a microscope
at the next little critter,
the next bit of pond scum,
curious about a question
we don't even know today is a question?
It could be a great question
that could impact all the world.
And maybe, maybe you're curious about you.
Now that you know
how to protect your telomeres,
are you curious what are you going to do
with all those decades
of brimming good health?
And now that you know you could impact
the telomeres of others,
are you curious
how will you make a difference?
And now that you know the power
of curiosity to change the world,
how will you make sure
that the world invests in curiosity
for the sake of the generations
that will come after us?
Thank you.
(Applause)
In many patriarchal societies and tribal societies,
fathers are usually known by their sons,
but I'm one of the few fathers
who is known by his daughter,
and I am proud of it.
(Applause)
Malala started her campaign for education
and stood for her rights in 2007,
and when her efforts were honored in 2011,
and she was given the national youth peace prize,
and she became a very famous,
very popular young girl of her country.
Before that, she was my daughter,
but now I am her father.
Ladies and gentlemen,
if we glance to human history,
the story of women
is the story of injustice,
inequality,
violence and exploitation.
You see,
in patriarchal societies,
right from the very beginning,
when a girl is born,
her birth is not celebrated.
She is not welcomed,
neither by father nor by mother.
The neighborhood comes
and commiserates with the mother,
and nobody congratulates the father.
And a mother is very uncomfortable
for having a girl child.
When she gives birth to the first girl child,
first daughter, she is sad.
When she gives birth to the second daughter,
she is shocked,
and in the expectation of a son,
when she gives birth to a third daughter,
she feels guilty like a criminal.
Not only the mother suffers,
but the daughter, the newly born daughter,
when she grows old,
she suffers too.
At the age of five,
while she should be going to school,
she stays at home
and her brothers are admitted in a school.
Until the age of 12, somehow,
she has a good life.
She can have fun.
She can play with her friends in the streets,
and she can move around in the streets
like a butterfly.
But when she enters her teens,
when she becomes 13 years old,
she is forbidden to go out of her home
without a male escort.
She is confined under the four walls of her home.
She is no more a free individual.
She becomes the so-called honor
of her father and of her brothers
and of her family,
and if she transgresses
the code of that so-called honor,
she could even be killed.
And it is also interesting that this so-called
code of honor,
it does not only affect the life of a girl,
it also affects the life
of the male members of the family.
I know a family of seven sisters and one brother,
and that one brother,
he has migrated to the Gulf countries,
to earn a living for his seven sisters
and parents,
because he thinks that it will be humiliating
if his seven sisters learn a skill
and they go out of the home
and earn some livelihood.
So this brother,
he sacrifices the joys of his life
and the happiness of his sisters
at the altar of so-called honor.
And there is one more norm
of the patriarchal societies
that is called obedience.
A good girl is supposed to be
very quiet, very humble
and very submissive.
It is the criteria.
The role model good girl should be very quiet.
She is supposed to be silent
and she is supposed to accept the decisions
of her father and mother
and the decisions of elders,
even if she does not like them.
If she is married to a man she doesn't like
or if she is married to an old man,
she has to accept,
because she does not want to be dubbed
as disobedient.
If she is married very early,
she has to accept.
Otherwise, she will be called disobedient.
And what happens at the end?
In the words of a poetess,
she is wedded, bedded,
and then she gives birth
to more sons and daughters.
And it is the irony of the situation
that this mother,
she teaches the same lesson of obedience
to her daughter
and the same lesson of honor to her sons.
And this vicious cycle goes on, goes on.
Ladies and gentlemen,
this plight of millions of women
could be changed
if we think differently,
if women and men think differently,
if men and women in the
tribal and patriarchal societies
in the developing countries,
if they can break a few norms
of family and society,
if they can abolish the discriminatory laws
of the systems in their states,
which go against the basic human rights
of the women.
Dear brothers and sisters, when Malala was born,
and for the first time,
believe me,
I don't like newborn children, to be honest,
but when I went and I looked into her eyes,
believe me,
I got extremely honored.
And long before she was born,
I thought about her name,
and I was fascinated with a heroic
legendary freedom fighter in Afghanistan.
Her name was Malalai of Maiwand,
and I named my daughter after her.
A few days after Malala was born,
my daughter was born,
my cousin came --
and it was a coincidence --
he came to my home
and he brought a family tree,
a family tree of the Yousafzai family,
and when I looked at the family tree,
it traced back to 300 years of our ancestors.
But when I looked, all were men,
and I picked my pen,
drew a line from my name,
and wrote, "Malala."
And when she grow old,
when she was four and a half years old,
I admitted her in my school.
You will be asking, then, why should I mention about
the admission of a girl in a school?
Yes, I must mention it.
It may be taken for granted in Canada,
in America, in many developed countries,
but in poor countries,
in patriarchal societies, in tribal societies,
it's a big event for the life of girl.
Enrollment in a school means
recognition of her identity and her name.
Admission in a school means
that she has entered the world of dreams
and aspirations
where she can explore her potentials
for her future life.
I have five sisters,
and none of them could go to school,
and you will be astonished,
two weeks before,
when I was filling out the Canadian visa form,
and I was filling out the family part of the form,
I could not recall
the surnames of some of my sisters.
And the reason was
that I have never, never seen the names
of my sisters written on any document.
That was the reason that
I valued my daughter.
What my father could not give to my sisters
and to his daughters,
I thought I must change it.
I used to appreciate the intelligence
and the brilliance of my daughter.
I encouraged her to sit with me
when my friends used to come.
I encouraged her to go with
me to different meetings.
And all these good values,
I tried to inculcate in her personality.
And this was not only she, only Malala.
I imparted all these good values
to my school, girl students 
and boy students as well.
I used education for emancipation.
I taught my girls,
I taught my girl students,
to unlearn the lesson of obedience.
I taught my boy students
to unlearn the lesson of so-called pseudo-honor.
Dear brothers and sisters,
we were striving for more rights for women,
and we were struggling to have more,
more and more space for the women in society.
But we came across a new phenomenon.
It was lethal to human rights
and particularly to women's rights.
It was called Talibanization.
It means a complete negation
of women's participation
in all political, economical and social activities.
Hundreds of schools were lost.
Girls were prohibited from going to school.
Women were forced to wear veils
and they were stopped from going to the markets.
Musicians were silenced,
girls were flogged
and singers were killed.
Millions were suffering,
but few spoke,
and it was the most scary thing
when you have all around such people
who kill and who flog,
and you speak for your rights.
It's really the most scary thing.
At the age of 10,
Malala stood, and she stood for the right
of education.
She wrote a diary for the BBC blog,
she volunteered herself
for the New York Times documentaries,
and she spoke from every platform she could.
And her voice was the most powerful voice.
It spread like a crescendo all around the world.
And that was the reason the Taliban
could not tolerate her campaign,
and on October 9 2012,
she was shot in the head at point blank range.
It was a doomsday for my family and for me.
The world turned into a big black hole.
While my daughter was
on the verge of life and death,
I whispered into the ears of my wife,
"Should I be blamed for what happened
to my daughter and your daughter?"
And she abruptly told me,
"Please don't blame yourself.
You stood for the right cause.
You put your life at stake
for the cause of truth,
for the cause of peace,
and for the cause of education,
and your daughter in inspired from you
and she joined you.
You both were on the right path
and God will protect her."
These few words meant a lot to me,
and I didn't ask this question again.
When Malala was in the hospital,
and she was going through the severe pains
and she had had severe headaches
because her facial nerve was cut down,
I used to see a dark shadow
spreading on the face of my wife.
But my daughter never complained.
She used to tell us,
"I'm fine with my crooked smile
and with my numbness in my face.
I'll be okay. Please don't worry."
She was a solace for us,
and she consoled us.
Dear brothers and sisters,
we learned from her how to be resilient
in the most difficult times,
and I'm glad to share with you
that despite being an icon
for the rights of children and women,
she is like any 16-year old girl.
She cries when her homework is incomplete.
She quarrels with her brothers,
and I am very happy for that.
People ask me,
what special is in my mentorship
which has made Malala so bold
and so courageous and so vocal and poised?
I tell them, don't ask me what I did.
Ask me what I did not do.
I did not clip her wings, and that's all.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. (Applause)
The creative process -- you know this --
from the first idea to the final product,
is a long process.
It's super-iterative, lots of refinement,
blood, sweat, tears and years.
And we're not saying
you're going to go out for a walk
and come back with the Sistine Chapel
in your left hand.
So what frame of the creative
process did we focus on?
Just this first part.
Just brainstorming,
coming up with a new idea.
We actually ran four studies
with a variety of people.
You were either walking
indoors or outdoors.
And all of these studies
found the same conclusion.
I'm only going to tell you
about one of them today.
One of the tests we used for creativity
was alternate uses.
In this test, you have four minutes.
Your job is to come up with as many other
ways to use common everyday objects
as you can think of.
So, for example,
what else would you do with a key,
other than to use it
for opening up a lock?
Clearly, you could use it
as a third eyeball for a giraffe, right?
Maybe. That's sort of interesting,
kind of new. But is it creative?
So people came up with
as many ideas as they could,
and we had to decide:
Is this creative or not?
The definition of creativity
that a lot of people go with
is "appropriate novelty."
For something to be appropriate,
it has to be realistic,
so unfortunately, you can't use
a key as an eyeball.
Boo!
But "novel," the second thing,
is that nobody had to have said it.
So for us, it had to be appropriate first,
and then for novelty,
nobody else in the entire population
that we surveyed could have said it.
So you might think you could use
a key to scratch somebody's car,
but if somebody else said that,
you didn't get credit for it.
Neither of you did.
However, only one person said this:
"If you were dying
and it were a murder mystery,
and you had to carve the name
of the murderer into the ground
with your dying words."
One person said this.
(Laughter)
And it's a creative idea,
because it's appropriate and it's novel.
You either did this test and came up
with ideas while you were seated
or while you were walking on a treadmill.
(Laughter)
They did the test twice,
with different objects.
Three groups: the first group sat first
and then sat again for the second test.
The second group sat first
and then did the second test
while walking on a treadmill.
The third group --
and this is interesting --
they walked on the treadmill first,
and then they sat.
OK, so the two groups
that sat together for the first test,
they looked pretty similar to each other,
and they averaged
about 20 creative ideas per person.
The group that was walking
on the treadmill
did almost twice as well.
And they were just walking
on a treadmill in a windowless room.
Remember, they took the test twice.
The people who sat twice for that second
test didn't get any better;
practice didn't help.
But these same people who were sitting
and then went on the treadmill
got a boost from walking.
Here's the interesting thing.
The people who were
walking on the treadmill
still had a residue effect of the walking,
and they were still creative afterwards.
So the implication of this
is that you should go for a walk
before your next big meeting
and just start brainstorming right away.
We have five tips for you
that will help make this
the best effect possible.
First, you want to pick a problem
or a topic to brainstorm.
So, this is not the shower effect,
when you're in the shower
and all of a sudden,
a new idea pops out of the shampoo bottle.
This is something
you're thinking about ahead of time.
They're intentionally thinking about
brainstorming a different perspective
on the walk.
Secondly -- I get asked this a lot:
Is this OK while running?
Well, the answer for me
is that if I were running,
the only new idea I would have
would be to stop running, so ...
(Laughter)
But if running for you
is a comfortable pace, good.
It turns out, whatever physical
activity is not taking a lot of attention.
So just walking at a comfortable
pace is a good choice.
Also, you want to come up with
as many ideas as you can.
One key of creativity
is to not lock on that first idea.
Keep going.
Keep coming up with new ones,
until you pick one or two to pursue.
You might worry that you don't want
to write them down,
because what if you forget them?
So the idea here is to speak them.
Everybody was speaking their new ideas.
So you can put your headphones on
and record through your phone
and then just pretend you're having
a creative conversation, right?
Because the act of writing
your idea down is already a filter.
You're going to be like,
"Is this good enough to write down?"
And then you write it down.
So just speak as many as you can,
record them and think about them later.
And finally: don't do this forever. Right?
If you're on the walk
and that idea's not coming to you,
come back to it later at another time.
I think we're coming up
on a break right now,
so I have an idea:
Why don't you grab a leash
and take your thoughts for a walk?
Thank you.
(Applause)
In the year 1901,
a woman called Auguste was taken
to a medical asylum in Frankfurt.
Auguste was delusional
and couldn't remember
even the most basic details of her life.
Her doctor was called Alois.
Alois didn't know how to help Auguste,
but he watched over her until,
sadly, she passed away in 1906.
After she died, Alois performed an autopsy
and found strange plaques
and tangles in Auguste's brain --
the likes of which he'd never seen before.
Now here's the even more striking thing.
If Auguste had instead been alive today,
we could offer her no more help
than Alois was able to 114 years ago.
Alois was Dr. Alois Alzheimer.
And Auguste Deter
was the first patient to be diagnosed with
what we now call Alzheimer's disease.
Since 1901, medicine has advanced greatly.
We've discovered antibiotics and vaccines
to protect us from infections,
many treatments for cancer,
antiretrovirals for HIV,
statins for heart disease and much more.
But we've made essentially no progress
at all in treating Alzheimer's disease.
I'm part of a team of scientists
who has been working to find
a cure for Alzheimer's for over a decade.
So I think about this all the time.
Alzheimer's now affects
40 million people worldwide.
But by 2050, it will affect
150 million people --
which, by the way,
will include many of you.
If you're hoping
to live to be 85 or older,
your chance of getting Alzheimer's
will be almost one in two.
In other words, odds are
you'll spend your golden years
either suffering from Alzheimer's
or helping to look after a friend
or loved one with Alzheimer's.
Already in the United States alone,
Alzheimer's care costs
200 billion dollars every year.
One out of every five
Medicare dollars get spent on Alzheimer's.
It is today the most expensive disease,
and costs are projected
to increase fivefold by 2050,
as the baby boomer generation ages.
It may surprise you that, put simply,
Alzheimer's is one of the biggest medical
and social challenges of our generation.
But we've done relatively
little to address it.
Today, of the top 10
causes of death worldwide,
Alzheimer's is the only one
we cannot prevent, cure or even slow down.
We understand less about the science
of Alzheimer's than other diseases
because we've invested less time
and money into researching it.
The US government
spends 10 times more every year
on cancer research than on Alzheimer's
despite the fact
that Alzheimer's costs us more
and causes a similar number
of deaths each year as cancer.
The lack of resources
stems from a more fundamental cause:
a lack of awareness.
Because here's what few people know
but everyone should:
Alzheimer's is a disease,
and we can cure it.
For most of the past 114 years,
everyone, including scientists, mistakenly
confused Alzheimer's with aging.
We thought that becoming senile
was a normal and inevitable
part of getting old.
But we only have to look at a picture
of a healthy aged brain compared
to the brain of an Alzheimer's patient
to see the real physical damage
caused by this disease.
As well as triggering severe loss
of memory and mental abilities,
the damage to the brain
caused by Alzheimer's
significantly reduces life expectancy
and is always fatal.
Remember Dr. Alzheimer
found strange plaques and tangles
in Auguste's brain a century ago.
For almost a century,
we didn't know much about these.
Today we know they're made
from protein molecules.
You can imagine a protein molecule
as a piece of paper that normally folds
into an elaborate piece of origami.
There are spots
on the paper that are sticky.
And when it folds correctly,
these sticky bits end up on the inside.
But sometimes things go wrong,
and some sticky bits are on the outside.
This causes the protein molecules
to stick to each other,
forming clumps that eventually become
large plaques and tangles.
That's what we see
in the brains of Alzheimer's patients.
We've spent the past 10 years
at the University of Cambridge
trying to understand
how this malfunction works.
There are many steps, and identifying
which step to try to block is complex --
like defusing a bomb.
Cutting one wire might do nothing.
Cutting others might
make the bomb explore.
We have to find the right step to block,
and then create a drug that does it.
Until recently, we for the most part
have been cutting wires
and hoping for the best.
But now we've got together
a diverse group of people --
medics, biologists, geneticists, chemists,
physicists, engineers and mathematicians.
And together, we've managed
to identify a critical step in the process
and are now testing a new class of drugs
which would specifically block this step
and stop the disease.
Now let me show you
some of our latest results.
No one outside of our lab
has seen these yet.
Let's look at some videos of what happened
when we tested these new drugs in worms.
So these are healthy worms,
and you can see
they're moving around normally.
These worms, on the other hand,
have protein molecules
sticking together inside them --
like humans with Alzheimer's.
And you can see they're clearly sick.
But if we give our new drugs
to these worms at an early stage,
then we see that they're healthy,
and they live a normal lifespan.
This is just an initial positive result,
but research like this
shows us that Alzheimer's is a disease
that we can understand and we can cure.
After 114 years of waiting,
there's finally real hope
for what can be achieved
in the next 10 or 20 years.
But to grow that hope,
to finally beat Alzheimer's, we need help.
This isn't about scientists like me --
it's about you.
We need you to raise awareness
that Alzheimer's is a disease
and that if we try, we can beat it.
In the case of other diseases,
patients and their families
have led the charge for more research
and put pressure on governments,
the pharmaceutical industry,
scientists and regulators.
That was essential for advancing treatment
for HIV in the late 1980s.
Today, we see that same drive
to beat cancer.
But Alzheimer's patients are often
unable to speak up for themselves.
And their families, the hidden victims,
caring for their loved ones night and day,
are often too worn out
to go out and advocate for change.
So, it really is down to you.
Alzheimer's isn't,
for the most part, a genetic disease.
Everyone with a brain is at risk.
Today, there are 40 million
patients like Auguste,
who can't create the change
they need for themselves.
Help speak up for them,
and help demand a cure.
Thank you.
(Applause)
If you do it right, it should sound like:
TICK-tat, TICK-tat, TICK-tat,
TICK-tat, TICK-tat, TICK-tat.
If you do it wrong, it sounds like:
Tick-TAT, tick-TAT, tick-TAT.
[Small thing. Big idea.]
[Kyra Gaunt on
the Jump Rope]
The jump rope is such a simple object.
It can be made out of rope,
a clothesline, twine.
It has, like, a twirl on it. (Laughs)
I'm not sure how to describe that.
What's important
is that it has a certain weight,
and that they have
that kind of whip sound.
It's not clear what the origin
of the jump rope is.
There's some evidence
that it began in ancient Egypt, Phoenicia,
and then it most likely traveled
to North America with Dutch settlers.
The rope became a big thing
when women's clothes became more fitted
and the pantaloon came into being.
And so, girls were able to jump rope
because their skirts
wouldn't catch the ropes.
Governesses used it
to train their wards to jump rope.
Even formerly enslaved African children
in the antebellum South
jumped rope, too.
In the 1950s, in Harlem,
Bronx, Brooklyn, Queens,
you could see on the sidewalk,
lots of girls playing with ropes.
Sometimes they would take two ropes
and turn them as a single rope together,
but you could separate them and turn
them in like an eggbeater on each other.
The skipping rope
was like a steady timeline --
tick, tick, tick, tick --
upon which you can add rhymes
and rhythms and chants.
Those ropes created a space
where we were able
to contribute to something
that was far greater
than the neighborhood.
Double Dutch jump rope remains
a powerful symbol of culture and identity
for black women.
Back from the 1950s to the 1970s,
girls weren't supposed to play sports.
Boys played baseball,
basketball and football,
and girls weren't allowed.
A lot has changed, but in that era,
girls would rule the playground.
They'd make sure
that boys weren't a part of that.
It's their space, it's a girl-power space.
It's where they get to shine.
But I also think it's for boys,
because boys overheard those,
which is why, I think,
so many hip-hop artists
sampled from things that they heard
in black girls' game songs.
(Chanting) ... cold, thick shake,
act like you know how to flip,
Filet-O-Fish, Quarter Pounder,
french fries, ice cold, thick shake,
act like you know how to jump.
Why "Country Grammar" by Nelly
became a Grammy Award-winning single
was because people already knew
"We're going down down baby
your street in a Range Rover ... "
That's the beginning of "Down down, baby,
down down the roller coaster,
sweet, sweet baby, I'll never let you go."
All people who grew up
in any black urban community
would know that music.
And so, it was a ready-made hit.
The Double Dutch rope playing
helped maintain these songs
and helped maintain the chants
and the gestures that go along with it,
which is very natural
to what I call "kinetic orality" --
word of mouth and word of body.
It's the thing that gets
passed down over generations.
In some ways, the rope
is the thing that helps carry it.
You need some object
to carry memory through.
So, a jump rope, you can use it
for all different kinds of things.
It crosses cultures.
And I think it lasted
because people need to move.
And I think sometimes the simplest objects
can make the most creative uses.
According to the UN,
billions of people still live
without an address.
The economist Hernando de Soto said,
"Without an address,
you live outside the law.
You might as well not exist."
I'm here to tell you how my team and I
are trying to change that.
If you go to an online map
and look at a favela in Brazil
or a township in South Africa,
you'll see a few streets
but a lot of empty space.
But if you flip to satellite view,
there are thousands of people,
homes and businesses
in this vast, unmapped
and unaddressed spaces.
In Ghana's capital, Accra,
there are numbers and letters
scrawled onto the sides of walls,
where they piloted address systems
but not finished them.
But these places,
these unaddressed places,
hold huge economic potential.
Here's why the issue
of addressing stuck with me.
I worked in the music
business for 10 years,
and what you may not know
about the music world
is that every day, people struggle
with the problems of addressing.
So from the musicians
who have to find the gigs
to the production companies
who bring the equipment,
everyone somehow always gets lost.
We even had to add someone
to our schedules
who was the person you called
when you thought you'd arrived
but then realized you hadn't.
And we had some pretty bad days,
like in Italy, where a truck driver
unloaded all the equipment
an hour north of Rome,
not an hour south of Rome,
and a slightly worse day
where a keyboard player
called me and said,
"Chris, don't panic,
but we may have just sound-checked
at the wrong people's wedding."
(Laughter)
So not long after the fated Rome event,
I chatted this through
with a friend of mine
who is a mathematician,
and we thought it was a problem
we could do something about.
We thought, well,
we could make a new system,
but it shouldn't look like the old system.
We agreed that addresses were bad.
We knew we wanted something very precise,
but GPS coordinates,
latitude and longitude,
were just too complicated.
So we divided the world
into three-meter squares.
The world divides into around 57 trillion
three-meter squares,
and we found that there are
enough combinations
of three dictionary words
that we could name every three-meter
square in the world uniquely
with just three words.
We used 40,000 words,
so that's 40,000 cubed,
64 trillion combinations of three words,
which is more than enough for
the 57-trillion-odd three-meter squares,
with a few spare.
So that's exactly what we did.
We divided the world
into three-meter squares,
gave each one a unique,
three-word identifier --
what we call a three-word address.
So for example, right here,
I'm standing at mustards.coupons.pinup,
(Laughter)
but over here ...
I'm standing at pinched.
singularly.tutorial.
But we haven't just done this in English.
We thought it was essential that people
should be able to use this system
in their own language.
So far, we've built it into 14 languages,
including French, Swahili and Arabic,
and we're working on more now,
like Xhosa, Zulu and Hindi.
But this idea can do a lot more
than just get my musicians
to their gigs on time.
If the 75 percent of countries
that struggle with reliable addressing
started using three-word addresses,
there's a stack of far more
important applications.
In Durban, South Africa,
an NGO called Gateway Health
have distributed 11,000
three-word address signs
to their community,
so the pregnant mothers,
when they go into labor,
can call the emergency services
and tell them exactly
where to pick them up from,
because otherwise, the ambulances
have often taken hours to find them.
In Mongolia, the National Post Service
have adopted the system
and are now doing deliveries
to many people's houses
for the first time.
The UN are using it
to geotag photos in disaster zones
so they can deliver aid
to exactly the right place.
Even Domino's Pizza
are using it in the Caribbean,
because they haven't been able
to find customers' homes,
but they really want to get
their pizza to them while its still hot.
Shortly, you'll be able to get into a car,
speak the three words,
and the car will navigate you
to that exact spot.
In Africa, the continent
has leapfrogged phone lines
to go to mobile phones,
bypassed traditional banks
to go straight to mobile payments.
We're really proud that the post services
of three African countries --
Nigeria, Djibouti and Côte d'Ivoire,
have gone straight to adopting
three-word addresses,
which means that people in those countries
have a really simple way
to explain where they live, today.
For me, poor addressing
was an annoying frustration,
but for billions of people,
it's a huge business inefficiency,
severely hampers
their infrastructure growth,
and can cost lives.
We're on a mission to change that,
three words at a time.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Five years ago, I experienced a bit
of what it must have been like to be Alice in Wonderland.
Penn State asked me, a communications teacher,
to teach a communications class for engineering students.
And I was scared. (Laughter)
Really scared. Scared of these students with their big brains
and their big books and their big, unfamiliar words.
But as these conversations unfolded,
I experienced what Alice must have when she went down
that rabbit hole and saw that door to a whole new world.
That's just how I felt as I had those conversations
with the students. I was amazed at the ideas
that they had, and I wanted others to experience this wonderland as well.
And I believe the key to opening that door
is great communication.
We desperately need great communication from our
scientists and engineers in order to change the world.
Our scientists and engineers are the ones
that are tackling our grandest challenges, from energy
to environment to health care, among others,
and if we don't know about it and understand it,
then the work isn't done, and I believe it's our responsibility
as non-scientists to have these interactions.
But these great conversations can't occur if our scientists
and engineers don't invite us in to see their wonderland.
So scientists and engineers, please, talk nerdy to us.
I want to share a few keys on how you can do that
to make sure that we can see that your science is sexy
and that your engineering is engaging.
First question to answer for us: so what?
Tell us why your science is relevant to us.
Don't just tell me that you study trabeculae,
but tell me that you study trabeculae, which is the mesh-like structure of our bones
because it's important to understanding and treating osteoporosis.
And when you're describing your science, beware of jargon.
Jargon is a barrier to our understanding of your ideas.
Sure, you can say "spatial and temporal," but why not just say
"space and time," which is so much more accessible to us?
And making your ideas accessible is not the same as dumbing it down.
Instead, as Einstein said, make everything
as simple as possible, but no simpler.
You can clearly communicate your science
without compromising the ideas.
A few things to consider are having examples, stories
and analogies. Those are ways to engage
and excite us about your content.
And when presenting your work, drop the bullet points.
Have you ever wondered why they're called bullet points? (Laughter)
What do bullets do? Bullets kill,
and they will kill your presentation.
A slide like this is not only boring, but it relies too much
on the language area of our brain, and causes us to become overwhelmed.
Instead, this example slide by Genevieve Brown is
much more effective. It's showing that the special structure
of trabeculae are so strong that they actually inspired
the unique design of the Eiffel Tower.
And the trick here is to use a single, readable sentence
that the audience can key into if they get a bit lost,
and then provide visuals which appeal to our other senses
and create a deeper sense of understanding
of what's being described.
So I think these are just a few keys that can help
the rest of us to open that door and see the wonderland
that is science and engineering.
And because the engineers that I've worked with have
taught me to become really in touch with my inner nerd,
I want to summarize with an equation. (Laughter)
Take your science, subtract your bullet points
and your jargon, divide by relevance,
meaning share what's relevant to the audience,
and multiply it by the passion that you have for
this incredible work that you're doing,
and that is going to equal incredible interactions
that are full of understanding.
And so, scientists and engineers, when you've solved
this equation, by all means, talk nerdy to me. (Laughter)
Thank you. (Applause)
Seventy-thousand years ago, our ancestors
were insignificant animals.
The most important thing to know
about prehistoric humans
is that they were unimportant.
Their impact on the world was not
much greater than that of jellyfish
or fireflies or woodpeckers.
Today, in contrast,
we control this planet.
And the question is:
How did we come from there to here?
How did we turn ourselves
from insignificant apes,
minding their own business
in a corner of Africa,
into the rulers of planet Earth?
Usually, we look for the difference
between us and all the other animals
on the individual level.
We want to believe -- I want to believe --
that there is something special about me,
about my body, about my brain,
that makes me so superior
to a dog or a pig, or a chimpanzee.
But the truth is that,
on the individual level,
I'm embarrassingly similar
to a chimpanzee.
And if you take me and a chimpanzee
and put us together on some lonely island,
and we had to struggle for survival
to see who survives better,
I would definitely place my bet
on the chimpanzee, not on myself.
And this is not something
wrong with me personally.
I guess if they took almost any one
of you, and placed you alone
with a chimpanzee on some island,
the chimpanzee would do much better.
The real difference between humans
and all other animals
is not on the individual level;
it's on the collective level.
Humans control the planet
because they are the only animals
that can cooperate both flexibly
and in very large numbers.
Now, there are other animals --
like the social insects,
the bees, the ants --
that can cooperate in large numbers,
but they don't do so flexibly.
Their cooperation is very rigid.
There is basically just one way
in which a beehive can function.
And if there's a new opportunity
or a new danger,
the bees cannot reinvent
the social system overnight.
They cannot, for example,
execute the queen
and establish a republic of bees,
or a communist dictatorship
of worker bees.
Other animals, like the social mammals --
the wolves, the elephants,
the dolphins, the chimpanzees --
they can cooperate much more flexibly,
but they do so only in small numbers,
because cooperation among chimpanzees
is based on intimate knowledge,
one of the other.
I'm a chimpanzee and you're a chimpanzee,
and I want to cooperate with you.
I need to know you personally.
What kind of chimpanzee are you?
Are you a nice chimpanzee?
Are you an evil chimpanzee?
Are you trustworthy?
If I don't know you, how can I
cooperate with you?
The only animal that can combine
the two abilities together
and cooperate both flexibly
and still do so in very large numbers
is us, Homo sapiens.
One versus one, or even 10 versus 10,
chimpanzees might be better than us.
But, if you pit 1,000 humans
against 1,000 chimpanzees,
the humans will win easily,
for the simple reason
that a thousand chimpanzees
cannot cooperate at all.
And if you now try to cram
100,000 chimpanzees
into Oxford Street,
or into Wembley Stadium,
or Tienanmen Square or the Vatican,
you will get chaos, complete chaos.
Just imagine Wembley Stadium
with 100,000 chimpanzees.
Complete madness.
In contrast, humans normally
gather there in tens of thousands,
and what we get is not chaos, usually.
What we get is extremely sophisticated
and effective networks of cooperation.
All the huge achievements
of humankind throughout history,
whether it's building the pyramids
or flying to the moon,
have been based not
on individual abilities,
but on this ability to cooperate
flexibly in large numbers.
Think even about this very talk
that I'm giving now:
I'm standing here in front of an audience
of about 300 or 400 people,
most of you are complete strangers to me.
Similarly, I don't really know
all the people who have organized
and worked on this event.
I don't know the pilot
and the crew members of the plane
that brought me over here,
yesterday, to London.
I don't know the people
who invented and manufactured
this microphone and these cameras,
which are recording what I'm saying.
I don't know the people
who wrote all the books and articles
that I read in preparation for this talk.
And I certainly don't know all the people
who might be watching this talk
over the Internet,
somewhere in Buenos Aires or in New Delhi.
Nevertheless, even though
we don't know each other,
we can work together to create
this global exchange of ideas.
This is something chimpanzees cannot do.
They communicate, of course,
but you will never catch a chimpanzee
traveling to some distant chimpanzee band
to give them a talk about bananas
or about elephants,
or anything else that might
interest chimpanzees.
Now cooperation is, of course,
not always nice;
all the horrible things humans
have been doing throughout history --
and we have been doing
some very horrible things --
all those things are also based
on large-scale cooperation.
Prisons are a system of cooperation;
slaughterhouses are a system
of cooperation;
concentration camps
are a system of cooperation.
Chimpanzees don't have slaughterhouses
and prisons and concentration camps.
Now suppose I've managed
to convince you perhaps that yes,
we control the world because we can
cooperate flexibly in large numbers.
The next question that immediately arises
in the mind of an inquisitive listener is:
How, exactly, do we do it?
What enables us alone, of all the animals,
to cooperate in such a way?
The answer is our imagination.
We can cooperate flexibly
with countless numbers of strangers,
because we alone, of all
the animals on the planet,
can create and believe fictions,
fictional stories.
And as long as everybody believes
in the same fiction,
everybody obeys and follows
the same rules,
the same norms, the same values.
All other animals use
their communication system
only to describe reality.
A chimpanzee may say, "Look!
There's a lion, let's run away!"
Or, "Look! There's a banana tree
over there! Let's go and get bananas!"
Humans, in contrast, use their language
not merely to describe reality,
but also to create new realities,
fictional realities.
A human can say, "Look,
there is a god above the clouds!
And if you don't do what I tell you to do,
when you die, God will punish you
and send you to hell."
And if you all believe this story
that I've invented,
then you will follow the same
norms and laws and values,
and you can cooperate.
This is something only humans can do.
You can never convince a chimpanzee
to give you a banana
by promising him, "... after you die,
you'll go to chimpanzee heaven ..."
(Laughter)
"... and you'll receive lots and lots
of bananas for your good deeds.
So now give me this banana."
No chimpanzee will ever
believe such a story.
Only humans believe such stories,
which is why we control the world,
whereas the chimpanzees are locked up
in zoos and research laboratories.
Now you may find it acceptable that yes,
in the religious field, humans cooperate
by believing in the same fictions.
Millions of people come together
to build a cathedral or a mosque
or fight in a crusade or a jihad, because
they all believe in the same stories
about God and heaven and hell.
But what I want to emphasize
is that exactly the same mechanism
underlies all other forms
of mass-scale human cooperation,
not only in the religious field.
Take, for example, the legal field.
Most legal systems today in the world
are based on a belief in human rights.
But what are human rights?
Human rights, just like God and heaven,
are just a story that we've invented.
They are not an objective reality;
they are not some biological effect
about homo sapiens.
Take a human being,
cut him open, look inside,
you will find the heart, the kidneys,
neurons, hormones, DNA,
but you won't find any rights.
The only place you find rights
are in the stories
that we have invented and spread around
over the last few centuries.
They may be very positive stories,
very good stories,
but they're still just fictional stories
that we've invented.
The same is true of the political field.
The most important factors
in modern politics are states and nations.
But what are states and nations?
They are not an objective reality.
A mountain is an objective reality.
You can see it, you can touch it,
you can even smell it.
But a nation or a state,
like Israel or Iran or France or Germany,
this is just a story that we've invented
and became extremely attached to.
The same is true of the economic field.
The most important actors today
in the global economy
are companies and corporations.
Many of you today, perhaps, work
for a corporation,
like Google or Toyota or McDonald's.
What exactly are these things?
They are what lawyers call legal fictions.
They are stories invented and maintained
by the powerful wizards we call lawyers.
(Laughter)
And what do corporations do all day?
Mostly, they try to make money.
Yet, what is money?
Again, money is not an objective reality;
it has no objective value.
Take this green piece
of paper, the dollar bill.
Look at it -- it has no value.
You cannot eat it, you cannot drink it,
you cannot wear it.
But then came along
these master storytellers --
the big bankers,
the finance ministers,
the prime ministers --
and they tell us a very convincing story:
"Look, you see this green piece of paper?
It is actually worth 10 bananas."
And if I believe it, and you believe it,
and everybody believes it,
it actually works.
I can take this worthless piece of paper,
go to the supermarket,
give it to a complete stranger
whom I've never met before,
and get, in exchange, real bananas
which I can actually eat.
This is something amazing.
You could never do it with chimpanzees.
Chimpanzees trade, of course:
"Yes, you give me a coconut,
I'll give you a banana."
That can work.
But, you give me
a worthless piece of paper
and you except me to give you a banana?
No way!
What do you think I am, a human?
(Laughter)
Money, in fact, is
the most successful story
ever invented and told by humans,
because it is the only story
everybody believes.
Not everybody believes in God,
not everybody believes in human rights,
not everybody believes in nationalism,
but everybody believes in money,
and in the dollar bill.
Take, even, Osama Bin Laden.
He hated American politics
and American religion
and American culture,
but he had no objection
to American dollars.
He was quite fond of them, actually.
(Laughter)
To conclude, then:
We humans control the world
because we live in a dual reality.
All other animals live
in an objective reality.
Their reality consists
of objective entities,
like rivers and trees
and lions and elephants.
We humans, we also live
in an objective reality.
In our world, too, there are rivers
and trees and lions and elephants.
But over the centuries,
we have constructed on top
of this objective reality
a second layer of fictional reality,
a reality made of fictional entities,
like nations, like gods,
like money, like corporations.
And what is amazing is that
as history unfolded,
this fictional reality became
more and more powerful
so that today, the most powerful
forces in the world
are these fictional entities.
Today, the very survival of rivers
and trees and lions and elephants
depends on the decisions and wishes
of fictional entities,
like the United States, like Google,
like the World Bank --
entities that exist only
in our own imagination.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Bruno Giussani: Yuval, you have
a new book out.
After Sapiens, you wrote another one,
and it's out in Hebrew, but not
yet translated into ...
Yuval Noah Harari: I'm working on
the translation as we speak.
BG: In the book, if I
understand it correctly,
you argue that the amazing breakthroughs
that we are experiencing right now
not only will potentially
make our lives better,
but they will create -- and I quote you --
"... new classes and new class struggles,
just as the industrial revolution did."
Can you elaborate for us?
YNH: Yes. In the industrial revolution,
we saw the creation of a new class
of the urban proletariat.
And much of the political and social
history of the last 200 years involved
what to do with this class,
and the new problems and opportunities.
Now, we see the creation of a new
massive class of useless people.
(Laughter)
As computers become better and better
in more and more fields,
there is a distinct possibility that
computers will out-perform us
in most tasks and will make
humans redundant.
And then the big political
and economic question
of the 21st century will be,
"What do we need humans for?",
or at least, "What do we need
so many humans for?"
BG: Do you have an answer in the book?
YNH: At present, the best guess
we have is to keep them happy
with drugs and computer games ...
(Laughter)
but this doesn't sound
like a very appealing future.
BG: Ok, so you're basically saying
in the book and now,
that for all the discussion
about the growing evidence
of significant economic inequality,
we are just kind of at the beginning
of the process?
YNH: Again, it's not a prophecy;
it's seeing all kinds
of possibilities before us.
One possibility is this creation
of a new massive class of useless people.
Another possibility is
the division of humankind
into different biological castes,
with the rich being upgraded
into virtual gods,
and the poor being degraded
to this level of useless people.
BG: I feel there is another TED talk
coming up in a year or two.
Thank you, Yuval, for making the trip.
YNH: Thanks!
(Applause)
Hetain Patel: (In Chinese)
Yuyu Rau: Hi, I'm Hetain. I'm an artist.
And this is Yuyu,
who is a dancer I have been working with.
I have asked her to translate for me.
HP: (In Chinese)
YR: If I may, I would like to tell you
a little bit about myself
and my artwork.
HP: (In Chinese)
YR: I was born and raised near Manchester,
in England,
but I'm not going to say it in English to you,
because I'm trying to avoid any assumptions
that might be made from my northern accent.
(Laughter)
HP: (In Chinese)
YR: The only problem with masking it
with Chinese Mandarin
is I can only speak this paragraph,
which I have learned by heart
when I was visiting in China. (Laughter)
So all I can do is keep repeating it in different tones
and hope you won't notice.
(Laughter)
HP: (In Chinese)
(Laughter)
YR: Needless to say, I would like to apologize
to any Mandarin speakers in the audience.
As a child, I would hate being made
to wear the Indian kurta pajama,
because I didn't think it was very cool.
It felt a bit girly to me, like a dress,
and it had this baggy trouser part
you had to tie really tight
to avoid the embarrassment of them falling down.
My dad never wore it,
so I didn't see why I had to.
Also, it makes me feel a bit uncomfortable,
that people assume I represent something
genuinely Indian when I wear it,
because that's not how I feel.
HP: (In Chinese)
YR: Actually, the only way I feel comfortable
wearing it is by pretending
they are the robes of a kung fu warrior
like Li Mu Bai from that film,
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon."
(Music)
Okay.
So my artwork is about identity and language,
challenging common assumptions
based on how we look like or where we come from,
gender, race, class.
What makes us who we are anyway?
HP: (In Chinese)
YR: I used to read Spider-Man comics,
watch kung fu movies,
take philosophy lessons from Bruce Lee.
He would say things like --
HP: Empty your mind.
(Laughter)
Be formless, shapeless, like water.
Now you put water into a cup.
It becomes the cup.
You put water into a bottle, it becomes the bottle.
Put it in a teapot, it becomes the teapot.
Now, water can flow
or it can crash.
Be water, my friend. (Applause)
YR: This year, I am 32 years old,
the same age Bruce Lee was when he died.
I have been wondering recently,
if he were alive today,
what advice he would give me
about making this TED Talk.
HP: Don't imitate my voice.
It offends me.
(Laughter)
YR: Good advice,
but I still think that we learn who we are
by copying others.
Who here hasn't imitated their childhood hero
in the playground, or mum or father?
I have.
HP: A few years ago, in order to make this video
for my artwork, I shaved off all my hair
so that I could grow it back as my father had it
when he first emigrated from India
to the U.K. in the 1960s.
He had a side parting and a neat mustache.
At first, it was going very well.
I even started to get discounts in Indian shops.
(Laughter)
But then very quickly,
I started to underestimate
my mustache growing ability,
and it got way too big.
It didn't look Indian anymore.
Instead, people from across the road,
they would shout things like --
HP and YR: Arriba! Arriba! Ándale! Ándale!
(Laughter)
HP: Actually, I don't know why I am even talking like this.
My dad doesn't even have an Indian accent anymore.
He talks like this now.
So it's not just my father that I've imitated.
A few years ago I went to China for a few months,
and I couldn't speak Chinese,
and this frustrated me,
so I wrote about this and had it translated
into Chinese, and then I learned this by heart,
like music, I guess.
YR: This phrase is now etched into my mind
clearer than the pin number to my bank card,
so I can pretend I speak Chinese fluently.
When I had learned this phrase,
I had an artist over there hear me out
to see how accurate it sounded.
I spoke the phrase, and then he laughed
and told me, "Oh yeah, that's great,
only it kind of sounds like a woman."
I said, "What?"
He said, "Yeah, you learned from a woman?"
I said, "Yes. So?"
He then explained the tonal differences
between male and female voices
are very different and distinct, and that I had learned it very well,
but in a woman's voice.
(Laughter)
(Applause)
HP: Okay. So this imitation business
does come with risk.
It doesn't always go as you plan it,
even with a talented translator.
But I am going to stick with it,
because contrary to what we might usually assume,
imitating somebody can reveal something unique.
So every time I fail
to become more like my father,
I become more like myself.
Every time I fail to become Bruce Lee,
I become more authentically me.
This is my art.
I strive for authenticity,
even if it comes in a shape
that we might not usually expect.
It's only recently that I've started to understand
that I didn't learn to sit like this
through being Indian.
I learned this from Spider-Man.
(Laughter)
Thank you.
(Applause)
Good morning!
Are you awake?
They took my name tag,
but I wanted to ask you,
did anyone here write their name
on the tag in Arabic?
Anyone! No one?
All right, no problem.
Once upon a time, not long ago,
I was sitting in a restaurant with my friend,
ordering food.
So I looked at the waiter and said,
"Do you have a menu (Arabic)?"
He looked at me strangely,
thinking that he misheard.
He said, "Sorry? (English)."
I said,
"The menu (Arabic), please."
He replied,
"Don't you know what they call it?"
"I do."
He said, "No! It's called "menu" (English),
or "menu" (French)."
Is the French pronunciation correct?
"Come, come, take care of this one!"
said the waiter.
He was disgusted when talking to me,
as if he was saying to himself,
"If this was the last girl on Earth,
I wouldn't look at her!"
What's the meaning
of saying "menu" in Arabic?
Two words made a Lebanese young man
judge a girl as being backward
and ignorant.
How could she speak that way?
At that moment, I started thinking.
It made me mad.
It definitely hurts!
I'm denied the right to speak
my own language in my own country?
Where could this happen?
How did we get here?
Well, while we are here,
there are many people like me,
who would reach a stage in their lives,
where they involuntarily give up
everything
that has happened to them in the past,
just so they can say that they're modern
and civilized.
Should I forget all my culture, thoughts,
intellect and all my memories?
Childhood stories might be the best memories
we have of the war!
Should I forget everything
I learned in Arabic, just to conform?
To be one of them?
Where's the logic in that?
Despite all that,
I tried to understand him.
I didn't want to judge him
with the same cruelty that he judged me.
The Arabic language
doesn't satisfy today's needs.
It's not a language for science,
research,
a language we're used to in universities,
a language we use in the workplace,
a language we rely on if we were to perform
an advanced research project,
and it definitely isn't a language
we use at the airport.
If we did so,
they'd strip us of our clothes.
Where can I use it, then?
We could all ask this question!
So, you want us to use Arabic.
Where are we to do so?
This is one reality.
But we have another more important reality
that we ought to think about.
Arabic is the mother tongue.
Research says that mastery
of other languages
demands mastery of the mother tongue.
Mastery of the mother tongue is a prerequisite
for creative expression in other languages.
How?
Gibran Khalil Gibran,
when he first started writing,
he used Arabic.
All his ideas, imagination and philosophy
were inspired by this little boy
in the village
where he grew up,
smelling a specific smell,
hearing a specific voice,
and thinking a specific thought.
So, when he started writing in English,
he had enough baggage.
Even when he wrote in English,
when you read his writings in English,
you smell the same smell,
sense the same feeling.
You can imagine that that's him
writing in English,
the same boy who came from the mountain.
From a village on Mount Lebanon.
So, this is an example
no one can argue with.
Second, it's often said
that if you want to kill a nation,
the only way to kill a nation,
is to kill its language.
This is a reality
that developed societies are aware of.
The Germans, French, Japanese and Chinese,
all these nations are aware of this.
That's why they legislate
to protect their language.
They make it sacred.
That's why they use it in production,
they pay a lot of money to develop it.
Do we know better than them?
All right,
we aren't from the developed world,
this advanced thinking
hasn't reached us yet,
and we would like to catch up
with the civilized world.
Countries that were once like us,
but decided to strive for development,
do research,
and catch up with those countries,
such as Turkey, Malaysia and others,
they carried their language with them
as they were climbing the ladder,
protected it like a diamond.
They kept it close to them.
Because if you get any product
from Turkey or elsewhere
and it's not labeled in Turkish,
then it isn't a local product.
You wouldn't believe it's a local product.
They'd go back to being consumers,
clueless consumers, like we are
most of the time.
So, in order for them to innovate and produce,
they had to protect their language.
If I say, "Freedom, sovereignty,
independence (Arabic),"
what does this remind you of?
It doesn't ring a bell, does it?
Regardless of the who, how and why.
Language isn't just for conversing,
just words coming out of our mouths.
Language represents specific stages
in our lives,
and terminology
that is linked to our emotions.
So when we say,
"Freedom, sovereignty, independence,"
each one of you draws a specific image
in their own mind,
there are specific feelings
of a specific day
in a specific historical period.
Language isn't one, two
or three words or letters put together.
It's an idea inside
that relates to how we think,
and how we see each other
and how others see us.
What is our intellect?
How do you say
whether this guy understands or not?
So, if I say, "Freedom, sovereignty,
independence (English),"
or if your son came up to you and said,
"Dad, have you lived through the period of
the freedom (English) slogan?"
How would you feel?
If you don't see a problem,
then I'd better leave,
and stop talking in vain.
The idea is that these expressions
remind us of a specific thing.
I have a francophone friend
who's married to a French man.
I asked her once how things were going.
She said,
"Everything is fine,
but once, I spent a whole night
asking and trying to translate
the meaning of the word
'toqborni' for him."
(Laughter)
(Applause)
The poor woman had mistakenly told him
"toqborni,"
and then spent the whole night
trying to explain it to him.
He was puzzled by the thought:
"How could anyone be this cruel?
Does she want to commit suicide?
'Bury me?' (English)"
This is one of the few examples.
It made us feel that she's unable to tell
that word to her husband,
since he won't understand,
and he's right not to;
his way of thinking is different.
She said to me,
"He listens to Fairuz with me,
and one night,
I tried to translate for him
so he can feel what I feel when
I listen to Fairuz."
The poor woman tried to translate
this for him:
"From them I extended my hands
and stole you --"
(Laughter)
And here's the pickle:
"And because you belong to them,
I returned my hands and left you."
(Laughter)
Translate that for me.
(Applause)
So, what have we done to protect
the Arabic language?
We turned this into a concern
of the civil society,
and we launched a campaign to preserve
the Arabic language.
Even though many people told me,
"Why do you bother?
Forget about this headache
and go have fun."
No problem!
The campaign to preserve Arabic
launched a slogan that says,
"I talk to you from the East,
but you reply from the West."
We didn't say,
"No! We do not accept this or that."
We didn't adopt this style because
that way, we wouldn't be understood.
And when someone talks to me that way,
I hate the Arabic language.
We say--
(Applause)
We want to change our reality,
and be convinced in a way that reflects
our dreams, aspirations and day-to-day life.
In a way that dresses like us
and thinks like we do.
So, "I talk to you from the East,
but you reply from the West"
has hit the spot.
Something very easy,
yet creative and persuasive.
After that,
we launched another campaign
with scenes of letters on the ground.
You've seen an example of it outside,
a scene of a letter surrounded
by black and yellow tape
with "Don't kill your language!"
written on it.
Why?
Seriously, don't kill your language.
We really shouldn't kill our language.
If we were to kill the language,
we'd have to find an identity.
We'd have to find an existence.
We'd go back to the beginning.
This is beyond just missing our chance
of being modern and civilized.
After that we released photos
of guys and girls wearing the Arabic letter.
Photos of "cool" guys and girls.
We are very cool!
And to whoever might say,
"Ha! You used an English word!"
I say,
"No! I adopt the word 'cool.'"
Let them object however they want,
but give me a word that's nicer
and matches the reality better.
I will keep on saying "Internet"
I wouldn't say:
"I'm going to the world wide web"
(Laughs)
Because it doesn't fit!
We shouldn't kid ourselves.
But to reach this point,
we all have to be convinced
that we shouldn't allow anyone
who is bigger
or thinks they have any authority over us
when it comes to language,
to control us or make us think and feel
what they want.
Creativity is the idea.
So, if we can't reach space
or build a rocket and so on,
we can be creative.
At this moment, every one of you
is a creative project.
Creativity in your mother tongue
is the path.
Let's start from this moment.
Let's write a novel
or produce a short film.
A single novel could make us global again.
It could bring the Arabic language
back to being number one.
So, it's not true that there's no solution;
there is a solution!
But we have to know that, and be convinced
that a solution exists,
that we have a duty
to be part of that solution.
In conclusion, what can you do today?
Now, tweets, who's tweeting?
Please, I beg of you,
even though my time has finished,
either Arabic, English, French
or Chinese.
But don't write Arabic
with Latin characters mixed with numbers!
(Applause)
It's a disaster!
That's not a language.
You'd be entering a virtual world
with a virtual language.
It's not easy to come back
from such a place and rise.
That's the first thing we can do.
Second, there are many other things
that we can do.
We're not here today to convince
each other.
We're here to bring attention
to the necessity of preserving this language.
Now I will tell you a secret.
A baby first identifies its father
through language.
When my daughter is born, I'll tell her,
"This is your father, honey (Arabic)."
I wouldn't say,
"This is your dad, honey (English)."
And in the supermarket,
I promise my daughter Noor,
that if she says to me,
"Thanks (Arabic),"
I won't say, "Dis, 'Merci, Maman,'"
and hope no one has heard her.
(Applause)
Let's get rid of this cultural cringe.
(Applause)
So I thought, "I will talk about death."
Seemed to be the passion today.
Actually, it's not about death.
It's inevitable, terrible, but really what I want to talk about is,
I'm just fascinated by the legacy people leave when they die.
That's what I want to talk about.
So Art Buchwald left his legacy of humor with a video
that appeared soon after he died, saying,
"Hi! I'm Art Buchwald, and I just died."
And Mike, who I met at Galapagos, a trip which I won at TED,
is leaving notes on cyberspace where he is chronicling
his journey through cancer.
And my father left me a legacy of his handwriting
through letters and a notebook.
In the last two years of his life, when he was sick,
he filled a notebook with his thoughts about me.
He wrote about my strengths, weaknesses,
and gentle suggestions for improvement,
quoting specific incidents, and held a mirror to my life.
After he died, I realized that no one writes to me anymore.
Handwriting is a disappearing art.
I'm all for email and thinking while typing,
but why give up old habits for new?
Why can't we have letter writing and email exchange in our lives?
There are times when I want to trade all those years
that I was too busy to sit with my dad and chat with him,
and trade all those years for one hug.
But too late.
But that's when I take out his letters and I read them,
and the paper that touched his hand is in mine,
and I feel connected to him.
So maybe we all need to leave our children
with a value legacy, and not a financial one.
A value for things with a personal touch --
an autographed book, a soul-searching letter.
If a fraction of this powerful TED audience
could be inspired to buy a beautiful paper --
John, it'll be a recycled one -- and write a beautiful letter
to someone they love, we actually may start a revolution
where our children may go to penmanship classes.
So what do I plan to leave for my son?
I collect autographed books, and those of you authors
in the audience know I hound you for them --
and CDs too, Tracy.
I plan to publish my own notebook.
As I witnessed my father's body being swallowed by fire,
I sat by his funeral pyre and wrote.
I have no idea how I'm going to do it,
but I am committed to compiling his thoughts and mine
into a book, and leave that published book for my son.
I'd like to end with a few verses of what I wrote
at my father's cremation.
And those linguists, please pardon the grammar,
because I've not looked at it in the last 10 years.
I took it out for the first time to come here.
"Picture in a frame, ashes in a bottle,
boundless energy confined in the bottle,
forcing me to deal with reality,
forcing me to deal with being grown up.
I hear you and I know that you would want me to be strong,
but right now, I am being sucked down, surrounded
and suffocated by these raging emotional waters,
craving to cleanse my soul, trying to emerge
on a firm footing one more time, to keep on fighting and flourishing
just as you taught me.
Your encouraging whispers in my whirlpool of despair,
holding me and heaving me to shores of sanity,
to live again and to love again."
Thank you.
There's a question I've been
puzzling over and writing about
for pretty much all of my adult life.
Why do some large-scale crises
jolt us awake and inspire us
to change and evolve
while others might jolt us a bit,
but then it's back to sleep?
Now, the kind of shocks
I'm talking about are big --
a cataclysmic market crash,
rising fascism,
an industrial accident
that poisons on a massive scale.
Now, events like this
can act like a collective alarm bell.
Suddenly, we see a threat,
we get organized.
We discover strength and resolve
that was previously unimaginable.
It's as if we're no longer
walking, but leaping.
Except, our collective alarm
seems to be busted.
Faced with a crisis,
we often fall apart, regress
and that becomes a window
for antidemocratic forces
to push societies backwards,
to become more unequal and more unstable.
Ten years ago, I wrote
about this backwards process
and I called it the "Shock Doctrine."
So what determines which road
we navigate through crisis?
Whether we grow up fast
and find those strengths
or whether we get knocked back.
And I'd say this is
a pressing question these days.
Because things are
pretty shocking out there.
Record-breaking storms, drowning cities,
record-breaking fires
threatening to devour them,
thousands of migrants
disappearing beneath the waves.
And openly supremacist movements rising,
in many of our countries
there are torches in the streets.
And now there's no shortage
of people who are sounding the alarm.
But as a society,
I don't think we can honestly say
that we're responding
with anything like the urgency
that these overlapping crises
demand from us.
And yet, we know from history
that it is possible for crisis
to catalyze a kind of evolutionary leap.
And one of the most striking examples
of this progressive power of crisis
is the Great Crash of 1929.
There was the shock
of the sudden market collapse
followed by all of the aftershocks,
the millions who lost everything
thrown onto breadlines.
And this was taken by many as a message
that the system itself was broken.
And many people listened
and they leapt into action.
In the United States and elsewhere,
governments began to weave a safety net
so that the next time there was a crash
there would be programs
like social security to catch people.
There were huge job-creating
public investments
in housing, electrification and transit.
And there was a wave
of aggressive regulation
to reign in the banks.
Now, these reforms were far from perfect.
In the US, African American workers,
immigrants and women
were largely excluded.
But the Depression period,
along with the transformation
of allied nations and economies
during the World War II effort,
show us that it is possible
for complex societies
to rapidly transform themselves
in the face of a collective threat.
Now, when we tell this story
of the 1929 Crash,
that's usually the formula
that it follows --
that there was a shock
and it induced a wake-up call
and that produced a leap to a safer place.
Now, if that's really what it took,
then why isn't it working anymore?
Why do today's non-stop shocks --
why don't they spur us into action?
Why don't they produce leaps?
Especially when it comes
to climate change.
So I want to talk to you today
about what I think is a much more
complete recipe for deep transformation
catalyzed by shocking events.
And I'm going to focus
on two key ingredients
that usually get left out
of the history books.
One has to do with imagination,
the other with organization.
Because it's in the interplay
between the two
where revolutionary power lies.
So let's start with imagination.
The victories of the New Deal
didn't happen just because suddenly
everybody understood
the brutalities of laissez-faire.
This was a time, let's remember,
of tremendous ideological ferment,
when many different ideas
about how to organize societies
did battle with one another
in the public square.
A time when humanity dared to dream big
about different kinds of futures,
many of them organized
along radically egalitarian lines.
Now, not all of these ideas were good
but this was an era
of explosive imagining.
This meant that the movements
demanding change
knew what they were against --
crushing poverty, widening inequality --
but just as important,
they knew what they were for.
They had their "no"
and they had their "yes," too.
They also had very different
models of political organization
than we do today.
For decades, social and labor movements
had been building up
their membership bases,
linking their causes together
and increasing their strength.
Which meant that by the time
the Crash happened,
there was already a movement
that was large and broad enough
to, for instance, stage strikes
that didn't just shut down factories,
but shut down entire cities.
The big policy wins of the New Deal
were actually offered as compromises.
Because the alternative
seemed to be revolution.
So, let's adjust
that equation from earlier.
A shocking event plus utopian imagination
plus movement muscle,
that's how we get a real leap.
So how does our present moment measure up?
We are living, once again, at a time
of extraordinary political engagements.
Politics is a mass obsession.
Progressive movements are growing
and resisting with tremendous courage.
And yet, we know from history
that "no" is not enough.
Now, there are some "yeses"
out there that are emerging.
And they're actually getting
a lot bolder quickly.
Where climate activists
used to talk about changing light bulbs,
now we're pushing
for 100 percent of our energy
to come from the sun, wind and waves,
and to do it fast.
Movements catalyzed
by police violence against black bodies
are calling for an end
to militarized police, mass incarceration
and even for reparations for slavery.
Students are not just
opposing tuition increases,
but from Chile to Canada to the UK,
they are calling for free tuition
and debt cancellation.
And yet, this still doesn't add up
to the kind of holistic
and universalist vision
of a different world
than our predecessors had.
So why is that?
Well, very often
we think about political change
in defined compartments these days.
Environment in one box,
inequality in another,
racial and gender justice
in a couple of other boxes,
education over here, health over there.
And within each compartment,
there are thousands upon thousands
of different groups and NGOs,
each competing with one another
for credit, name recognition
and of course, resources.
In other words, we act
a lot like corporate brands.
Now, this is often referred to
as the problem of silos.
Now, silos are understandable.
They carve up our complex world
into manageable chunks.
They help us feel less overwhelmed.
But in the process,
they also train our brains to tune out
when somebody else's issue comes up
and when somebody else's issue
needs our help and support.
And they also keep us from seeing
glaring connections between our issues.
So for instance, the people fighting
poverty and inequality
rarely talk about climate change.
Even though we see time and again
that it's the poorest of people
who are the most vulnerable
to extreme weather.
The climate change people
rarely talk about war and occupation.
Even though we know
that the thirst for fossil fuels
has been a major driver of conflict.
The environmental movement
has gotten better at pointing out
that the nations that are getting
hit hardest by climate change
are populated overwhelmingly
by black and brown people.
But when black lives
are treated as disposable
in prisons, in schools and on the streets,
these connections are too rarely made.
The walls between our silos
also means that our solutions,
when they emerge,
are also disconnected from each other.
So progressives now have this long list
of demands that I was mentioning earlier,
those "yeses."
But what we're still missing
is that coherent picture
of the world we're fighting for.
What it looks like, what it feels like,
and most of all, what its core values are.
And that really matters.
Because when large-scale crises hit us
and we are confronted with the need
to leap somewhere safer,
there isn't any agreement
on what that place is.
And leaping without a destination
looks a lot like jumping up and down.
(Laughter)
Fortunately, there are all kinds
of conversations and experiments going on
to try to overcome these divisions
that are holding us back.
And I want to finish
by talking about one of them.
A couple of years ago,
a group of us in Canada
decided that we were hitting the limits
of what we could accomplish
in our various silos.
So we locked ourselves
in a room for two days,
and we tried to figure out
what bound us together.
In that room were people
who rarely get face to face.
There were indigenous elders
with hipsters working on transit.
There was the head of Greenpeace
with a union leader
representing oil workers and loggers.
There were faith leaders
and feminist icons and many more.
And we gave ourselves
a pretty ambitious assignment:
agreeing on a short statement
describing the world after we win.
The world after we've already
made the transition to a clean economy
and a much fairer society.
In other words,
instead of trying to scare people
about what will happen if we don't act,
we decided to try to inspire them
with what could happen if we did act.
Sensible people are always telling us
that change needs to come
in small increments.
That politics is the art of the possible
and that we can't let the perfect
be the enemy of the good.
Well, we rejected all of that.
We wrote a manifesto,
and we called it "The Leap."
I have to tell you
that agreeing on our common "yes"
across such diversity of experiences
and against a backdrop
of a lot of painful history
was not easy work.
But it was also pretty thrilling.
Because as soon as we gave ourselves
permission to dream,
those threads connecting
much of our work became self-evident.
We realized, for instance,
that the bottomless quest for profits
that is forcing so many people
to work more than 50 hours a week,
without security,
and that is fueling
this epidemic of despair
is the same quest for bottomless
profits and endless growth
that is at the heart
of our ecological crisis
and is destabilizing our planet.
It also became clear what we need to do.
We need to create
a culture of care-taking.
In which no one
and nowhere is thrown away.
In which the inherent value of all people
and every ecosystem is foundational.
So we came up with this people's platform,
and don't worry, I'm not going to read
the whole thing to you out loud --
if you're interested,
you can read it at theleap.org.
But I will give you a taste
of what we came up with.
So we call for that 100 percent
renewable economy in a hurry,
but we went further.
Calls for new kinds of trade deals,
a robust debate
on a guaranteed annual income,
full rights for immigrant workers,
getting corporate money out of politics,
free universal day care,
electoral reform and more.
What we discovered
is that a great many of us
are looking for permission to act
less like brands and more like movements.
Because movements don't care about credit.
They want good ideas
to spread far and wide.
What I love about The Leap
is that it rejects the idea
that there is this hierarchy of crisis,
and it doesn't ask anyone
to prioritize one struggle over another
or wait their turn.
And though it was birthed in Canada,
we've discovered that it travels well.
Since we launched, The Leap
has been picked up around the world
with similar platforms,
being written from Nunavut to Australia,
to Norway to the UK and the US,
where it's gaining a lot of traction
in cities like Los Angeles,
where it's being localized.
And also in rural communities
that are traditionally very conservative,
but where politics is failing
the vast majority of people.
Here's what I've learned from studying
shocks and disasters for two decades.
Crises test us.
We either fall apart or we grow up fast.
Finding new reserves of strength
and capacity that we never knew we had.
The shocking events
that fill us with dread today
can transform us, and they can
transform the world for the better.
But first we need to picture the world
that we're fighting for.
And we have to dream it up together.
Right now, every alarm in our house
is going off simultaneously.
It's time to listen.
It's time to leap.
Thank you.
(Applause)
One way to change our genes is to make new ones,
as Craig Venter has so elegantly shown.
Another is to change our lifestyles.
And what we're learning is how powerful and dynamic these changes can be,
that you don't have to wait very long to see the benefits.
When you eat healthier, manage stress, exercise and love more,
your brain actually gets more blood flow and more oxygen.
But more than that, your brain gets measurably bigger.
Things that were thought impossible just a few years ago
can actually be measured now.
This was figured out by Robin Williams
a few years before the rest of us.
Now, there's some things that you can do
to make your brain grow new brain cells.
Some of my favorite things, like chocolate and tea, blueberries,
alcohol in moderation, stress management
and cannabinoids found in marijuana.
I'm just the messenger.
(Laughter)
What were we just talking about?
(Laughter)
And other things that can make it worse,
that can cause you to lose brain cells.
The usual suspects, like saturated fat and sugar,
nicotine, opiates, cocaine, too much alcohol and chronic stress.
Your skin gets more blood flow when you change your lifestyle,
so you age less quickly. Your skin doesn't wrinkle as much.
Your heart gets more blood flow.
We've shown that you can actually reverse heart disease.
That these clogged arteries that you see on the upper left,
after only a year become measurably less clogged.
And the cardiac PET scan shown on the lower left,
the blue means no blood flow.
A year later -- orange and white is maximum blood flow.
We've shown you may be able to stop and reverse the progression
of early prostate cancer and, by extension, breast cancer,
simply by making these changes.
We've found that tumor growth in vitro was inhibited
70 percent in the group that made these changes,
whereas only nine percent in the comparison group.
These differences were highly significant.
Even your sexual organs get more blood flow,
so you increase sexual potency.
One of the most effective anti-smoking ads was done
by the Department of Health Services,
showing that nicotine, which constricts your arteries,
can cause a heart attack or a stroke,
but it also causes impotence.
Half of guys who smoke are impotent.
How sexy is that?
Now we're also about to publish a study --
the first study showing you can change gene expression in men with prostate cancer.
This is what's called a heat map --
and the different colors -- and along the side, on the right, are different genes.
And we found that over 500 genes were favorably changed --
in effect, turning on the good genes, the disease-preventing genes,
turning off the disease-promoting genes.
And so these findings I think are really very powerful,
giving many people new hope and new choices.
And companies like Navigenics and DNA Direct and 23andMe,
that are giving you your genetic profiles,
are giving some people a sense of, "Gosh, well, what can I do about it?"
Well, our genes are not our fate, and if we make these changes --
they're a predisposition -- but if we make bigger changes
than we might have made otherwise,
we can actually change how our genes are expressed.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Hi. I'm Kevin Allocca, I'm the trends manager at YouTube,
and I professionally watch YouTube videos.
It's true.
So we're going to talk a little bit today about how videos go viral
and then why that even matters.
We all want to be stars --
celebrities, singers, comedians --
and when I was younger, that seemed so very, very hard to do.
But now Web video has made it
so that any of us or any of the creative things that we do
can become completely famous
in a part of our world's culture.
Any one of you could be famous on the Internet
by next Saturday.
But there are over 48 hours of video uploaded to YouTube
every minute.
And of that, only a tiny percentage
ever goes viral and gets tons of views and becomes a cultural moment.
So how does it happen?
Three things:
tastemakers, communities of participation
and unexpectedness.
All right, let's go.
(Video) Bear Vasquez: Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Oh, my God!
Wooo!
Ohhhhh, wowwww!
KA: Last year, Bear Vasquez posted this video
that he had shot outside his home in Yosemite National Park.
In 2010, it was viewed 23 million times.
(Laughter)
This is a chart of what it looked like
when it first became popular last summer.
But he didn't actually set out to make a viral video, Bear.
He just wanted to share a rainbow.
Because that's what you do when your name is Yosemite Mountain Bear.
(Laughter)
And he had posted lots of nature videos in fact.
And this video had actually been posted
all the way back in January.
So what happened here?
Jimmy Kimmel actually.
Jimmy Kimmel posted this tweet
that would eventually propel the video to be as popular as it would become.
Because tastemakers like Jimmy Kimmel
introduce us to new and interesting things
and bring them to a larger audience.
(Video) Rebecca Black: ♫ It's Friday, Friday. Gotta get down on Friday. ♫
♫ Everybody's looking forward to the weekend, weekend. ♫
♫ Friday, Friday. Gettin' down on Friday. ♫
KA: So you didn't think that we could actually have this conversation
without talking about this video I hope.
Rebecca Black's "Friday" is one of the most popular videos of the year.
It's been seen nearly 200 million times this year.
This is a chart of what it looked like.
And similar to "Double Rainbow,"
it seems to have just sprouted up out of nowhere.
So what happened on this day?
Well it was a Friday, this is true.
And if you're wondering about those other spikes, those are also Fridays.
(Laughter)
But what about this day,
this one particular Friday?
Well Tosh.0 picked it up, a lot of blogs starting writing about.
Michael J. Nelson from Mystery Science Theater
was one of the first people to post a joke about the video on Twitter.
But what's important is that an individual or a group of tastemakers
took a point of view
and they shared that with a larger audience, accelerating the process.
And so then this community formed
of people who shared this big inside joke
and they started talking about it and doing things with it.
And now there are 10,000 parodies of "Friday" on YouTube.
Even in the first seven days,
there was one parody for every other day of the week.
(Laughter)
Unlike the one-way entertainment of the 20th century,
this community participation
is how we become a part of the phenomenon --
either by spreading it or by doing something new with it.
(Music)
So "Nyan Cat" is a looped animation
with looped music.
It's this, just like this.
It's been viewed nearly 50 million times this year.
And if you think that that is weird,
you should know that there is a three-hour version of this
that's been viewed four million times.
(Laughter)
Even cats were watching this video.
(Laughter)
Cats were watching other cats watch this video.
(Laughter)
But what's important here
is the creativity that it inspired
amongst this techie, geeky Internet culture.
There were remixes.
(Laughter)
Someone made an old timey version.
(Laughter)
And then it went international.
(Laughter)
An entire remix community sprouted up
that brought it from being just a stupid joke
to something that we can all actually be a part of.
Because we don't just enjoy now,
we participate.
And who could have predicted any of this?
Who could have predicted "Double Rainbow" or Rebecca Black
or "Nyan Cat?"
What scripts could you have written
that would have contained this in it?
In a world where over two days of video
get uploaded every minute,
only that which is truly unique and unexpected
can stand out in the way that these things have.
When a friend of mine told me that I needed to see this great video
about a guy protesting bicycle fines in New York City,
I admit I wasn't very interested.
(Video) Casey Niestat: So I got a ticket for not riding in the bike lane,
but often there are obstructions
that keep you from properly riding in the bike lane.
(Laughter)
KA: By being totally surprising and humorous,
Casey Niestat got his funny idea and point
seen five million times.
And so this approach holds
for anything new that we do creatively.
And so it all brings us
to one big question ...
(Video) Bear Vasquez: What does this mean?
Ohhhh.
(Laughter)
KA: What does it mean?
Tastemakers, creative participating communities,
complete unexpectedness,
these are characteristics of a new kind of media and a new kind of culture
where anyone has access
and the audience defines the popularity.
I mean, as mentioned earlier,
one of the biggest stars in the world right now, Justin Bieber,
got his start on YouTube.
No one has to green-light your idea.
And we all now feel some ownership
in our own pop culture.
And these are not characteristics of old media,
and they're barely true of the media of today,
but they will define the entertainment of the future.
Thank you.
(Applause)
We all have milestones in life
that we remember so vividly.
The first one for me
was when I was entering kindergarten.
My big brother was in school,
and by golly, it was my time.
And I went trottin' down that hallway.
I was so excited, I almost wet myself.
And I go to the door,
and there was the teacher
with a warm welcome,
and she took me into the classroom,
showed me my little cubbyhole --
we all remember those
little cubbyholes, don't we --
and we put our stuff in there.
And then she said, "Go over to the circle
and play with the kids
until class starts."
So I went over there
and plopped down like I owned the place,
and I'm playing,
and all of a sudden, the boy next to me,
he was wearing a white shirt
with blue shorts.
I remember it like it was yesterday.
Suddenly he stopped playing and he said,
"Why are you so short?"
And I just kept playing.
I didn't think he was talking to me.
(Laughter)
And in a louder voice, he said,
"Hey, why are you so short?"
So I looked up and I said,
"What are you talking about?
Let's just play. We're happy.
I've been waiting for this."
And so we played,
and about a minute later,
the girl next to him,
in a white shirt and a pink skirt,
stood up, put her hands on her hips,
and said, "Yeah,
why do you look so different?"
And I went, "What are you talking about?
I don't look different. I'm not short.
Again, let's just play."
About this time, I looked
all around the circle I was in,
and all the kids had stopped playing
and they were all looking at me.
And I'm thinking --
in today's language,
it would be "OMG" or "WTF."
(Laughter)
What just happened?
So all the confidence
that I went in with that morning
was withering away as the morning went on
and the questions kept coming.
And at the end of the morning,
before I went home,
the teacher had us in a circle,
and I actually found myself
outside of the circle.
I couldn't look at anybody.
I could not understand what just happened.
And over the next few years,
I hated to go out in public.
I felt every stare, every giggle,
every pointed finger,
not the finger,
but every pointed finger,
and I hated it.
I would hide behind my parents' legs
like nobody could see me.
And as a child,
you can't understand
another child's curiosity,
nor an adult's ignorance.
It became very apparent to me
that the real world was not built
for someone of my size,
both literally or figuratively.
And so I have no anonymity,
as you can probably tell,
and while you can see my size,
we all go through many challenges
through our lifetime.
And some you can see, like mine.
Most you can't.
You can't tell if someone's dealing
with a mental illness,
or they're struggling
with their gender identity,
they're caring for an aging parent,
they're having financial difficulty.
You can't see that kind of stuff.
So while you can see
one of my challenges is my size,
seeing does not mean you understand
what it's truly to be me on a daily basis,
or what I go through.
And so I'm here to debunk a myth.
I do not believe you can
walk in someone else's shoes,
and because of that, we must adopt
a new way of giving of ourselves.
Simply stated, I will never know
what it's like to be you
and you will never know
what it's like to be me.
I cannot face your fears
or chase your dreams,
and you can't do that for me,
but we can be supportive of each other.
Instead of trying to walk
in each other's shoes,
we must adopt a new way
of giving of ourselves.
I learned at an early age
that I did have to do some things
different than most people,
but I also learned there were things
I was on equal footing with,
and one of those was the classroom.
Heh, heh, heh. I was equal.
As a matter of fact,
I excelled in the classroom.
This was vitally important,
I discovered as I grew older
and realized I wasn't going to be able
to do a physical job.
I needed an education.
So I went on and got a university degree,
but I felt to be one step ahead
of everyone for employment,
I needed to have
an advanced university degree,
so I went ahead and got that.
Now I'm ready for my interview.
Remember your first interview?
What am I going to wear?
What questions?
And don't forget that firm handshake.
I was right there with you.
So 24 hours before my interview,
a friend of mine
who I've known all my life
called and said, "Michele,
the building you're going in has steps."
And she knew I couldn't climb steps.
So suddenly, my focus changed.
In my shoes, I was worried
about how am I going to get there?
So I went early and found a loading dock
and got in and had a great interview.
They had no idea what I went through
for the day and that's OK.
You're probably thinking my greatest
challenge that day was the interview,
or getting in the building.
In reality, my biggest challenge that day
was getting through the loading dock
without getting run over.
I am very vulnerable
in certain situations:
airports, hallways, parking lots,
loading docks.
And so I have to be very careful.
I have to anticipate and be flexible
and move as quickly as I can sometimes.
So I got the job,
and in my current role
I travel quite a bit.
And travel is a challenge
for all of us these days.
And so you probably get to the airport,
run through security, get to the gate.
Did I get my aisle seat or my window seat?
Did I get my upgrade?
Me, first of all,
I don't run through anything.
(Laughter)
And I especially don't run through the TSA
because I get to experience
the personal patdown.
I won't comment on that.
And then I make my way to the gate,
and with my gift of gab
that my parents said I was born with,
I talk to the gate agent, and then I say,
"By the way, my scooter weighs this much,
I have a dry cell battery,
and I can drive it down
to the door of the plane."
Also, the day before, I had called
the city where I'm traveling to
to find out where I could rent a scooter
in case mine gets broken on the way.
So in my shoes,
it's a little bit different.
When I get onto the plane,
I use my gift of gab to ask the lady
to put my bag up, and they graciously do.
I try not to eat or drink on a plane
because I don't want to have to
get up and walk on the plane,
but nature has its own schedule,
and not long ago,
it knocked and I answered.
So I walked up to the front of the plane
and gabbed with the flight attendant,
and said, "Can you watch the door?
I can't reach the lock."
So I'm in there doing my business,
and the door flies open.
And there's a gentleman there
with a look of horror on his face.
I'm sure I had the same look.
As I came out, I noticed
that he was sitting right across from me,
and he's in total, complete embarrassment.
So I walk up to him and I quietly go,
"Are you going to remember this
as much as I am?"
(Laughter)
And he goes, "I think so."
(Laughter)
Now, while he's probably
not talking about it publicly, I am.
(Laughter)
But we talked for the rest of the flight,
and we got to know each other,
our families, sports, work,
and when we landed, he said,
"Michele, I noticed
someone put your bag up.
Can I get that for you?"
And I said, "Of course, thank you."
And we wished each other well,
and the most important thing that day
was that he was not going to leave
with that embarrassment,
that experience of embarrassment.
He won't forget it, and neither will I,
but I think he will remember more
our chat and our different perspectives.
When you travel internationally,
it can be even more challenging
in certain ways.
A few years ago, I was in Zanzibar,
and I come wheeling in,
and think about that.
Short, white, blond woman in a chair.
That doesn't probably happen every day.
So I go up, and with my gift of gab,
I start to talk to the agent.
So friendly, and I ask
about their culture and so forth,
and I notice there wasn't a jet bridge.
So I had to kind of say,
"Not only do you have to lift my chair,
I could use some help
getting up the steps."
So we got to spend about an hour together
while we waited for the flight,
and it was the most magnificent hour.
Our perspective changed
for both of us that day.
And once I got on the flight,
he patted me on the back
and wished me well,
and I thanked him so much.
And again, I think he's going
to remember that experience more
than when I first came in,
and there was a bit of hesitation.
And as you notice, I get a lot of help.
I would not be where I am today
if it was not for my family,
my friends, my colleagues
and the many strangers
that help me every single day of my life.
And it's important
that we all have a support system.
Asking for help is a strength,
not a weakness.
(Applause)
We all need help throughout our lifetime,
but it is just as important
that we are part
of other people's support systems.
We must adopt that way of giving back.
We all obviously have a role to play
in our own successes,
but think about the role we have to play
in other people's successes,
just like people do for me
every single day.
It's vitally important
that we help each other,
because society is increasingly
placing people in silos
based on biases and ideologies.
And we must look past the surface
and be confronted with the truth
that none of us are what you can see.
There's more to us than that,
and we're all dealing with things
that you cannot see.
So living a life free of judgment
allows all of us to share
those experiences together
and have a totally different perspective,
just like the couple of people
I mentioned earlier in my stories.
So remember, the only shoes
you truly can walk in are your own.
I cannot walk in yours.
I know you can't walk in my size 1s --
(Laughter)
but you can try.
But we can do something better than that.
With compassion,
courage and understanding,
we can walk side by side
and support one another,
and think about how society can change
if we all do that
instead of judging
on only what you can see.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Thank you.
For the past decade,
I've been studying non-state armed groups:
armed organizations like terrorists,
insurgents or militias.
I document what these groups do
when they're not shooting.
My goal is to better understand
these violent actors
and to study ways to encourage transition
from violent engagement
to nonviolent confrontation.
I work in the field, in the policy world
and in the library.
Understanding non-state armed groups
is key to solving most ongoing conflict,
because war has changed.
It used to be a contest between states.
No longer.
It is now a conflict between states
and non-state actors.
For example, of the 216 peace agreements
signed between 1975 and 2011,
196 of them were between a state
and a non-state actor.
So we need to understand these groups;
we need to either engage them
or defeat them in any conflict resolution
process that has to be successful.
So how do we do that?
We need to know what makes
these organizations tick.
We know a lot about
how they fight, why they fight,
but no one looks at what they're doing
when they're not fighting.
Yet, armed struggle
and unarmed politics are related.
It is all part of the same organization.
We cannot understand these groups,
let alone defeat them,
if we don't have the full picture.
And armed groups today
are complex organizations.
Take the Lebanese Hezbollah,
known for its violent
confrontation against Israel.
But since its creation in the early 1980s,
Hezbollah has also set up
a political party,
a social-service network,
and a military apparatus.
Similarly, the Palestinian Hamas,
known for its suicide attacks
against Israel,
also runs the Gaza Strip since 2007.
So these groups do way more
than just shoot.
They multi-task.
They set up complex
communication machines --
radio stations, TV channels,
Internet websites
and social media strategies.
And up here, you have the ISIS magazine,
printed in English
and published to recruit.
Armed groups also invest
in complex fund-raising --
not looting, but setting up
profitable businesses;
for example, construction companies.
Now, these activities are keys.
They allow these groups
to increase their strength,
increase their funds,
to better recruit
and to build their brand.
Armed groups also do something else:
they build stronger bonds
with the population
by investing in social services.
They build schools, they run hospitals,
they set up vocational-training programs
or micro-loan programs.
Hezbollah offers all
of these services and more.
Armed groups also seek
to win the population over
by offering something
that the state is not providing:
safety and security.
The initial rise of the Taliban
in war-torn Afghanistan,
or even the beginning
of the ascent of ISIS,
can be understood also by looking
at these groups' efforts
to provide security.
Now, unfortunately, in these cases,
the provision of security
came at an unbearably high price
for the population.
But in general, providing
social services fills a gap,
a governance gap left by the government,
and allows these groups
to increase their strength
and their power.
For example, the 2006 electoral victory
of the Palestinian Hamas
cannot be understood without
acknowledging the group's social work.
Now, this is a really complex picture,
yet in the West,
when we look at armed groups,
we only think of the violent side.
But that's not enough to understand
these groups' strength,
strategy or long-term vision.
These groups are hybrid.
They rise because they fill a gap
left by the government,
and they emerge
to be both armed and political,
engage in violent struggle
and provide governance.
And the more these organizations
are complex and sophisticated,
the less we can think of them
as the opposite of a state.
Now, what do you call
a group like Hezbollah?
They run part of a territory,
they administer all their functions,
they pick up the garbage,
they run the sewage system.
Is this a state? Is it a rebel group?
Or maybe something else,
something different and new?
And what about ISIS?
The lines are blurred.
We live in a world of states,
non-states, and in-between,
and the more states are weak,
like in the Middle East today,
the more non-state actors
step in and fill that gap.
This matters for governments,
because to counter these groups,
they will have to invest more
in non-military tools.
Filling that governance gap
has to be at the center
of any sustainable approach.
This also matters very much
for peacemaking and peacebuilding.
If we better understand armed groups,
we will better know
what incentives to offer
to encourage the transition
from violence to nonviolence.
So in this new contest
between states and non-states,
military power can win some battles,
but it will not give us
peace nor stability.
To achieve these objectives,
what we need is a long-term investment
in filling that security gap,
in filling that governance gap
that allowed these groups
to thrive in the first place.
Thank you.
(Applause)
What is going to be the future of learning?
I do have a plan,
but in order for me to tell you what that plan is,
I need to tell you a little story,
which kind of sets the stage.
I tried to look at
where did the kind of learning we do in schools,
where did it come from?
And you can look far back into the past,
but if you look at present-day schooling the way it is,
it's quite easy to figure out where it came from.
It came from about 300 years ago,
and it came from the last
and the biggest of the empires on this planet. ["The British Empire"]
Imagine trying to run the show,
trying to run the entire planet,
without computers, without telephones,
with data handwritten on pieces of paper,
and traveling by ships.
But the Victorians actually did it.
What they did was amazing.
They created a global computer
made up of people.
It's still with us today.
It's called the bureaucratic administrative machine.
In order to have that machine running,
you need lots and lots of people.
They made another machine to produce those people:
the school.
The schools would produce the people
who would then become parts of the
bureaucratic administrative machine.
They must be identical to each other.
They must know three things:
They must have good handwriting, because the data is handwritten;
they must be able to read;
and they must be able to do multiplication,
division, addition and subtraction in their head.
They must be so identical that you could pick one up from New Zealand
and ship them to Canada
and he would be instantly functional.
The Victorians were great engineers.
They engineered a system that was so robust
that it's still with us today,
continuously producing identical people
for a machine that no longer exists.
The empire is gone,
so what are we doing with that design
that produces these identical people,
and what are we going to do next
if we ever are going to do anything else with it?
["Schools as we know them are obsolete"]
So that's a pretty strong comment there.
I said schools as we know them now, they're obsolete.
I'm not saying they're broken.
It's quite fashionable to say that the education system's broken.
It's not broken. It's wonderfully constructed.
It's just that we don't need it anymore. It's outdated.
What are the kind of jobs that we have today?
Well, the clerks are the computers.
They're there in thousands in every office.
And you have people who guide those computers
to do their clerical jobs.
Those people don't need to be able to write beautifully by hand.
They don't need to be able to multiply numbers in their heads.
They do need to be able to read.
In fact, they need to be able to read discerningly.
Well, that's today, but we don't even know
what the jobs of the future are going to look like.
We know that people will work from wherever they want,
whenever they want, in whatever way they want.
How is present-day schooling going to prepare them
for that world?
Well, I bumped into this whole thing completely by accident.
I used to teach people how to write computer programs
in New Delhi, 14 years ago.
And right next to where I used to work, there was a slum.
And I used to think, how on Earth are those kids
ever going to learn to write computer programs?
Or should they not?
At the same time, we also had lots of parents,
rich people, who had computers,
and who used to tell me, "You know, my son,
I think he's gifted,
because he does wonderful things with computers.
And my daughter -- oh, surely she is extra-intelligent."
And so on. So I suddenly figured that,
how come all the rich people are having
these extraordinarily gifted children?
(Laughter)
What did the poor do wrong?
I made a hole in the boundary wall
of the slum next to my office,
and stuck a computer inside it just to see what would happen
if I gave a computer to children who never would have one,
didn't know any English, didn't know what the Internet was.
The children came running in.
It was three feet off the ground, and they said, "What is this?"
And I said, "Yeah, it's, I don't know."
(Laughter)
They said, "Why have you put it there?"
I said, "Just like that."
And they said, "Can we touch it?"I said, "If you wish to."
And I went away.
About eight hours later,
we found them browsing and teaching each other how to browse.
So I said, "Well that's impossible, because --
How is it possible? They don't know anything."
My colleagues said, "No, it's a simple solution.
One of your students must have been passing by,
showed them how to use the mouse."
So I said, "Yeah, that's possible."
So I repeated the experiment. I went 300 miles out of Delhi
into a really remote village
where the chances of a passing software development engineer
was very little. (Laughter)
I repeated the experiment there.
There was no place to stay, so I stuck my computer in,
I went away, came back after a couple of months,
found kids playing games on it.
When they saw me, they said,
"We want a faster processor and a better mouse."
(Laughter)
So I said, "How on Earth do you know all this?"
And they said something very interesting to me.
In an irritated voice, they said,
"You've given us a machine that works only in English,
so we had to teach ourselves English in order to use it." (Laughter)
That's the first time, as a teacher,
that I had heard the word "teach ourselves" said so casually.
Here's a short glimpse from those years.
That's the first day at the Hole in the Wall.
On your right is an eight-year-old.
To his left is his student. She's six.
And he's teaching her how to browse.
Then onto other parts of the country,
I repeated this over and over again,
getting exactly the same results that we were.
["Hole in the wall film - 1999"]
An eight-year-old telling his elder sister what to do.
And finally a girl explaining in Marathi what it is,
and said, "There's a processor inside."
So I started publishing.
I published everywhere. I wrote down and measured everything,
and I said, in nine months, a group of children
left alone with a computer in any language
will reach the same standard as an office secretary in the West.
I'd seen it happen over and over and over again.
But I was curious to know, what else would they do
if they could do this much?
I started experimenting with other subjects,
among them, for example, pronunciation.
There's one community of children in southern India
whose English pronunciation is really bad,
and they needed good pronunciation because that would improve their jobs.
I gave them a speech-to-text engine in a computer,
and I said, "Keep talking into it until it types what you say."
(Laughter)
They did that, and watch a little bit of this.
Computer: Nice to meet you.Child: Nice to meet you.
Sugata Mitra: The reason I ended with the face
of this young lady over there is because I suspect many of you know her.
She has now joined a call center in Hyderabad
and may have tortured you about your credit card bills
in a very clear English accent.
So then people said, well, how far will it go?
Where does it stop?
I decided I would destroy my own argument
by creating an absurd proposition.
I made a hypothesis, a ridiculous hypothesis.
Tamil is a south Indian language, and I said,
can Tamil-speaking children in a south Indian village
learn the biotechnology of DNA replication in English
from a streetside computer?
And I said, I'll measure them. They'll get a zero.
I'll spend a couple of months, I'll leave it for a couple of months,
I'll go back, they'll get another zero.
I'll go back to the lab and say, we need teachers.
I found a village. It was called Kallikuppam in southern India.
I put in Hole in the Wall computers there,
downloaded all kinds of stuff from the Internet about DNA replication,
most of which I didn't understand.
The children came rushing, said, "What's all this?"
So I said, "It's very topical, very important. But it's all in English."
So they said, "How can we understand such big English words
and diagrams and chemistry?"
So by now, I had developed a new pedagogical method,
so I applied that. I said, "I haven't the foggiest idea."
(Laughter)
"And anyway, I am going away."
(Laughter)
So I left them for a couple of months.
They'd got a zero. I gave them a test.
I came back after two months
and the children trooped in and said, "We've understood nothing."
So I said, "Well, what did I expect?"
So I said, "Okay, but how long did it take you
before you decided that you can't understand anything?"
So they said, "We haven't given up.
We look at it every single day."
So I said, "What? You don't understand these screens
and you keep staring at it for two months? What for?"
So a little girl who you see just now,
she raised her hand, and she says to me in broken Tamil and English,
she said, "Well, apart from the fact that
improper replication of the DNA molecule causes disease,
we haven't understood anything else."
(Laughter) (Applause)
So I tested them.
I got an educational impossibility, zero to 30 percent
in two months in the tropical heat
with a computer under the tree in a language they didn't know
doing something that's a decade ahead of their time.
Absurd. But I had to follow the Victorian norm.
Thirty percent is a fail.
How do I get them to pass? I have to get them 20 more marks.
I couldn't find a teacher. What I did find was a friend that they had,
a 22-year-old girl who was an accountant
and she played with them all the time.
So I asked this girl, "Can you help them?"
So she says, "Absolutely not.
I didn't have science in school. I have no idea
what they're doing under that tree all day long. I can't help you."
I said, "I'll tell you what. Use the method of the grandmother."
So she says, "What's that?"
I said, "Stand behind them.
Whenever they do anything, you just say,
'Well, wow, I mean, how did you do that?
What's the next page? Gosh, when I was your age, I could have never done that.'
You know what grannies do."
So she did that for two more months.
The scores jumped to 50 percent.
Kallikuppam had caught up
with my control school in New Delhi,
a rich private school with a trained biotechnology teacher.
When I saw that graph I knew there is a way to level the playing field.
Here's Kallikuppam.
(Children speaking) Neurons ... communication.
I got the camera angle wrong. That one is just amateur stuff,
but what she was saying, as you could make out,
was about neurons, with her hands were like that,
and she was saying neurons communicate.
At 12.
So what are jobs going to be like?
Well, we know what they're like today.
What's learning going to be like? We know what it's like today,
children pouring over with their mobile phones on the one hand
and then reluctantly going to school to pick up their books with their other hand.
What will it be tomorrow?
Could it be that we don't need to go to school at all?
Could it be that, at the point in time when you need to know something,
you can find out in two minutes?
Could it be -- a devastating question,
a question that was framed for me by Nicholas Negroponte --
could it be that we are heading towards or maybe in
a future where knowing is obsolete?
But that's terrible. We are homo sapiens.
Knowing, that's what distinguishes us from the apes.
But look at it this way.
It took nature 100 million years
to make the ape stand up
and become Homo sapiens.
It took us only 10,000 to make knowing obsolete.
What an achievement that is.
But we have to integrate that into our own future.
Encouragement seems to be the key.
If you look at Kuppam,
if you look at all of the experiments that I did,
it was simply saying, "Wow," saluting learning.
There is evidence from neuroscience.
The reptilian part of our brain, which sits in the center of our brain,
when it's threatened, it shuts down everything else,
it shuts down the prefrontal cortex, the parts which learn,
it shuts all of that down.
Punishment and examinations are seen as threats.
We take our children, we make them shut their brains down,
and then we say, "Perform."
Why did they create a system like that?
Because it was needed.
There was an age in the Age of Empires
when you needed those people who can survive under threat.
When you're standing in a trench all alone,
if you could have survived, you're okay, you've passed.
If you didn't, you failed.
But the Age of Empires is gone.
What happens to creativity in our age?
We need to shift that balance back
from threat to pleasure.
I came back to England looking for British grandmothers.
I put out notices in papers saying,
if you are a British grandmother, if you have broadband and a web camera,
can you give me one hour of your time per week for free?
I got 200 in the first two weeks.
I know more British grandmothers than anyone in the universe. (Laughter)
They're called the Granny Cloud.
The Granny Cloud sits on the Internet.
If there's a child in trouble, we beam a Gran.
She goes on over Skype and she sorts things out.
I've seen them do it from a village called Diggles
in northwestern England,
deep inside a village in Tamil Nadu, India,
6,000 miles away.
She does it with only one age-old gesture.
"Shhh."
Okay?
Watch this.
Grandmother: You can't catch me. You say it.
You can't catch me.
Children: You can't catch me.
Grandmother: I'm the Gingerbread Man.Children: I'm the Gingerbread Man.
Grandmother: Well done! Very good.
SM: So what's happening here?
I think what we need to look at is
we need to look at learning
as the product of educational self-organization.
If you allow the educational process to self-organize,
then learning emerges.
It's not about making learning happen.
It's about letting it happen.
The teacher sets the process in motion
and then she stands back in awe
and watches as learning happens.
I think that's what all this is pointing at.
But how will we know? How will we come to know?
Well, I intend to build
these Self-Organized Learning Environments.
They are basically broadband, collaboration
and encouragement put together.
I've tried this in many, many schools.
It's been tried all over the world, and teachers
sort of stand back and say, "It just happens by itself?"
And I said, "Yeah, it happens by itself.""How did you know that?"
I said, "You won't believe the children who told me
and where they're from."
Here's a SOLE in action.
(Children talking)
This one is in England.
He maintains law and order,
because remember, there's no teacher around.
Girl: The total number of electrons is not equal to the total number of protons -- SM: Australia
Girl: -- giving it a net positive or negative electrical charge.
The net charge on an ion is equal to the number of protons
in the ion minus the number of electrons.
SM: A decade ahead of her time.
So SOLEs, I think we need a curriculum of big questions.
You already heard about that. You know what that means.
There was a time when Stone Age men and women
used to sit and look up at the sky and say,
"What are those twinkling lights?"
They built the first curriculum, but we've lost sight of those wondrous questions.
We've brought it down to the tangent of an angle.
But that's not sexy enough.
The way you would put it to a nine-year-old is to say,
"If a meteorite was coming to hit the Earth,
how would you figure out if it was going to or not?"
And if he says, "Well, what? how?"
you say, "There's a magic word. It's called the tangent of an angle,"
and leave him alone. He'll figure it out.
So here are a couple of images from SOLEs.
I've tried incredible, incredible questions --
"When did the world begin? How will it end?" —
to nine-year-olds.
This one is about what happens to the air we breathe.
This is done by children without the help of any teacher.
The teacher only raises the question,
and then stands back and admires the answer.
So what's my wish?
My wish is
that we design the future of learning.
We don't want to be spare parts
for a great human computer, do we?
So we need to design a future for learning.
And I've got to -- hang on,
I've got to get this wording exactly right,
because, you know, it's very important.
My wish is to help design a future of learning
by supporting children all over the world
to tap into their wonder and their ability to work together.
Help me build this school.
It will be called the School in the Cloud.
It will be a school where children go on these intellectual adventures
driven by the big questions which their mediators put in.
The way I want to do this
is to build a facility where I can study this.
It's a facility which is practically unmanned.
There's only one granny
who manages health and safety.
The rest of it's from the cloud.
The lights are turned on and off by the cloud,
etc., etc., everything's done from the cloud.
But I want you for another purpose.
You can do Self-Organized Learning Environments
at home, in the school, outside of school, in clubs.
It's very easy to do. There's a great document
produced by TED which tells you how to do it.
If you would please, please do it
across all five continents
and send me the data,
then I'll put it all together, move it into the School of Clouds,
and create the future of learning.
That's my wish.
And just one last thing.
I'll take you to the top of the Himalayas.
At 12,000 feet, where the air is thin,
I once built two Hole in the Wall computers,
and the children flocked there.
And there was this little girl who was following me around.
And I said to her, "You know, I want to give a computer to everybody, every child.
I don't know, what should I do?"
And I was trying to take a picture of her quietly.
She suddenly raised her hand like this, and said to me,
"Get on with it."
(Laughter) (Applause)
I think it was good advice.
I'll follow her advice. I'll stop talking.
Thank you. Thank you very much.
(Applause)
Thank you. Thank you. (Applause)
Thank you very much. Wow. (Applause)
When you come to TEDx,
you always think about technology,
the world changing,
becoming more innovative.
You think about the driverless.
Everyone's talking
about driverless cars these days,
and I love the concept
of a driverless car,
but when I go in one, you know,
I want it really slow,
I want access to the steering wheel
and the brake, just in case.
I don't know about you,
but I am not ready for a driverless bus.
I am not ready for a driverless airplane.
How about a driverless world?
And I ask you that
because we are increasingly in one.
It's not supposed to be that way.
We're number one,
the United States is large and in charge.
Americanization and globalization
for the last several generations
have basically been the same thing.
Right? Whether it's
the World Trade Organization
or it's the IMF, the World Bank,
the Bretton Woods Accord on currency,
these were American institutions,
our values, our friends, our allies,
our money, our standards.
That was the way the world worked.
So it's sort of interesting,
if you want to look at how the US looks,
here it is.
This is our view of how the world is run.
President Obama has got the red carpet,
he goes down Air Force One,
and it feels pretty good,
it feels pretty comfortable.
Well, I don't know how many of you
saw the China trip last week
and the G20.
Oh my God. Right?
This is how we landed
for the most important meeting
of the world's leaders in China.
The National Security Advisor
was actually spewing expletives
on the tarmac --
no red carpet,
kind of left out the bottom of the plane
along with all the media
and everybody else.
Later on in the G20,
well, there's Obama.
(Laughter)
Hi, George.
Hi, Norman.
They look like they're
about to get into a cage match, right?
And they did. It was 90 minutes long,
and they talked about Syria.
That's what Putin wanted to talk about.
He's increasingly calling the shots.
He's the one willing to do stuff there.
There's not a lot of mutual like or trust,
but it's not as if the Americans
are telling him what to do.
How about when the whole 20
are getting together?
Surely, when the leaders are all onstage,
then the Americans
are pulling their weight.
Uh-oh.
(Laughter)
Xi Jinping seems fine.
Angela Merkel has -- she always does --
that look, she always does that.
But Putin is telling
Turkish president Erdogan what to do,
and Obama is like,
what's going on over there?
You see. And the problem is
it's not a G20,
the problem is
it's a G-Zero world that we live in,
a world order where there is
no single country or alliance
that can meet the challenges
of global leadership.
The G20 doesn't work,
the G7, all of our friends,
that's history.
So globalization is continuing.
Goods and services and people
and capital are moving across borders
faster and faster than ever before,
but Americanization is not.
So if I've convinced you of that,
I want to do two things
with the rest of this talk.
I want to talk
about the implications of that
for the whole world.
I'll go around it.
And then I want to talk about
what we think right here
in the United States and in New York.
So why? What are the implications.
Why are we here?
Well, we're here
because the United States,
we spent two trillion dollars
on wars in Iraq and Afghanistan
that were failed.
We don't want to do that anymore.
We have large numbers
of middle and working classes
that feel like they've not benefited
from promises of globalization,
so they don't want to see it particularly.
And we have an energy revolution
where we don't need OPEC
or the Middle East the way we used to.
We produce all that right here
in the United States.
So the Americans don't want
to be the global sheriff for security
or the architect of global trade.
The Americans don't want to even be
the cheerleader of global values.
Well, then you look to Europe,
and the most important
alliance in the world
has been the transatlantic relationship.
But it is now weaker than it has been
at any point since World War II,
all of the crises,
the Brexit conversations,
the hedging going on
between the French and the Russians,
or the Germans and the Turks,
or the Brits and the Chinese.
China does want to do more leadership.
They do, but only in the economic sphere,
and they want their own values,
standards, currency,
in competition with that of the US.
The Russians want to do more leadership.
You see that in Ukraine,
in the Baltic states, in the Middle East,
but not with the Americans.
They want their own preferences and order.
That's why we are where we are.
So what happens going forward?
Let's start easy,
with the Middle East.
(Laughter)
You know, I left a little out,
but you get the general idea.
Look, there are three reasons
why the Middle East
has had stability such as it is. Right?
One is because there was
a willingness to provide
some level of military security
by the US and allies.
Number two, it was easy to take
a lot of cheap money out of the ground
because oil was expensive.
And number three
was no matter how bad the leaders were,
the populations were relatively quiescent.
They didn't have the ability,
and many didn't have the will
to really rise up against.
Well, I can tell you, in a G-Zero world,
all three of those things
are increasingly not true,
and so failed states,
terrorism, refugees and the rest.
Does the entire Middle East fall apart?
No, the Kurds will do better,
and Iraq, Israel, Iran over time.
But generally speaking,
it's not a good look.
OK, how about this guy?
He's playing a poor hand very well.
There's no question
he's hitting above his weight.
But long term -- I didn't mean that.
But long term, long term,
if you think that the Russians
were antagonized by the US and Europe
expanding NATO right up to their borders
when we said they weren't going to,
and the EU encroaching them,
just wait until the Chinese
put hundreds of billions of dollars
in every country around Russia
they thought they had influence in.
The Chinese are going to dominate it.
The Russians are picking up the crumbs.
In a G-Zero world, this is going to be
a very tense 10 years for Mr. Putin.
It's not all bad. Right?
Asia actually looks a lot better.
There are real leaders across Asia,
they have a lot of political stability.
They're there for a while.
Mr. Modi in India,
Mr. Abe, who is probably
about to get a third term written in
in the Liberal Democratic Party in Japan,
of course Xi Jinping
who is consolidating enormous power,
the most powerful leader in China
since Mao.
Those are the three
most important economies in Asia.
Now look, there are problems in Asia.
We see the sparring
over the South China Sea.
We see that Kim Jong Un,
just in the last couple of days,
tested yet another nuclear weapon.
But the leaders in Asia
do not feel the need
to wave the flag,
to go xenophobic,
to actually allow escalation
of the geopolitical
and cross-border tensions.
They want to focus on long-term
economic stability and growth.
And that's what they're actually doing.
Let's turn to Europe.
Europe does look a little scared
in this environment.
So much of what is happening
in the Middle East
is washing up quite literally
onto European shores.
You see Brexit and you see
the concerns of populism
across all of the European states.
Let me tell you that over the long term,
in a G-Zero world,
European expansion
will be seen to have gone too far.
Europe went right up to Russia,
went right down to the Middle East,
and if the world were truly becoming
more flat and more Americanized,
that would be less of a problem,
but in a G-Zero world,
those countries nearest Russia
and nearest the Middle East
actually have different
economic capabilities,
different social stability
and different political preferences
and systems than core Europe.
So Europe was able to truly expand
under the G7,
but under the G-Zero,
Europe will get smaller.
Core Europe around Germany
and France and others
will still work, be functional,
stable, wealthy, integrated.
But the periphery,
countries like Greece
and Turkey and others,
will not look that good at all.
Latin America, a lot of populism,
made the economies not go so well.
They had been more opposed
to the United States for decades.
Increasingly, they're coming back.
We see that in Argentina.
We see it with the openness in Cuba.
We will see it in Venezuela
when Maduro falls.
We will see it in Brazil
after the impeachment
and when we finally see
a new legitimate president elected there.
The only place you see
that is moving in another direction
is the unpopularity
of Mexican president Peña Nieto.
There you could actually see
a slip away from the United States
over the coming years.
The US election matters a lot
on that one, too.
(Laughter)
Africa, right?
A lot of people have said
it's going to be Africa's decade, finally.
In a G-Zero world,
it is absolutely an amazing time
for a few African countries,
those governed well
with a lot of urbanization,
a lot of smart people,
women really getting into the workforce,
entrepreneurship taking off.
But for most of the countries in Africa,
it's going to be a lot more dicey:
extreme climate conditions,
radicalism both from Islam
and also Christianity,
very poor governance,
borders you can't defend,
lots of forced migration.
Those countries can fall off the map.
So you're really going to see
an extreme segregation going on
between the winners
and the losers across Africa.
Finally, back to the United States.
What do I think about us?
Because there are a lot of upset people,
not here at TEDx, I know,
but in the United States, my God,
after 15 months of campaigning,
we should be upset.
I understand that.
But a lot of people are upset
because they say, "Washington's broken,
we don't trust the establishment,
we hate the media."
Heck, even globalists like me
are taking it on the chin.
Look, I do think we have to recognize,
my fellow campers,
that when you are being
chased by the bear,
in the global context,
you need not outrun the bear,
you need to only outrun
your fellow campers.
(Laughter)
Now, I just told you
about our fellow campers.
Right? And from that perspective,
we look OK.
A lot of people in that context say,
"Let's go dollar.
Let's go New York real estate.
Let's send our kids
to American universities."
You know, our neighbors are awesome:
Canada, Mexico
and two big bodies of water.
You know how much Turkey
would love to have neighbors like that?
Those are awesome neighbors.
Terrorism is a problem
in the United States.
God knows we know it here in New York.
But it's a much bigger problem
in Europe than the US.
It's a much bigger problem
in the Middle East
than it is in Europe.
These are factors of large magnitude.
We just accepted 10,000 Syrian refugees,
and we're complaining bitterly about it.
You know why?
Because they can't swim here.
Right? I mean, the Turks would love
to have only 10,000 Syrian refugees.
The Jordanians,
the Germans, the Brits. Right?
That's not the situation.
That's the reality of the United States.
Now, that sounds pretty good.
Here's the challenge.
In a G-Zero world, the way you lead
is by example.
If we know we don't want to be
the global cop anymore,
if we know we're not going to be
the architect of global trade,
we're not going to be
the cheerleader of global values,
we're not going to do it
the way we used to,
the 21st century is changing,
we need to lead by example --
be so compelling
that all these other people
are going to still say,
it's not just they're faster campers.
Even when the bear is not chasing us,
this is a good place to be.
We want to emulate them.
The election process this year
is not proving a good option
for leading by example.
Hillary Clinton says
it's going to be like the '90s.
We can still be
that cheerleader on values.
We can still be
the architect of global trade.
We can still be the global sheriff.
And Donald Trump wants
to bring us back to the '30s.
He's saying, "Our way or the highway.
You don't like it, lump it." Right?
Neither are recognizing
a fundamental truth of the G-Zero,
which is that even though
the US is not in decline,
it is getting objectively harder
for the Americans to impose their will,
even have great influence,
on the global order.
Are we prepared to truly lead by example?
What would we have to do to fix this
after November,
after the next president comes in?
Well, either we have to have
another crisis that forces us to respond.
A depression would do that.
Another global financial
crisis could do this.
God forbid, another 9/11 could do that.
Or, absent crisis,
we need to see that the hollowing out,
the inequality, the challenges
that are growing and growing
in the United States,
are themselves urgent enough
to force our leaders to change,
and that we have those voices.
Through our cell phones, individually,
we have those voices
to compel them to change.
There is, of course, a third choice,
perhaps the most likely one,
which is that we do
neither of those things,
and in four years time you invite me back,
and I will give this speech yet again.
Thank you very, very much.
(Applause)
Imagine being unable to say,
"I am hungry," "I am in pain,"
"thank you," or "I love you."
Being trapped inside your body,
a body that doesn't respond to commands.
Surrounded by people,
yet utterly alone.
Wishing you could reach out,
to connect, to comfort, to participate.
For 13 long years, that was my reality.
Most of us never think twice
about talking, about communicating.
I've thought a lot about it.
I've had a lot of time to think.
For the first 12 years of my life,
I was a normal, happy, healthy little boy.
Then everything changed.
I contracted a brain infection.
The doctors weren't sure what it was,
but they treated me the best they could.
However, I progressively got worse.
Eventually, I lost my ability
to control my movements,
make eye contact,
and finally, my ability to speak.
While in hospital,
I desperately wanted to go home.
I said to my mother, "When home?"
Those were the last words
I ever spoke with my own voice.
I would eventually fail every test
for mental awareness.
My parents were told
I was as good as not there.
A vegetable, having the intelligence
of a three-month-old baby.
They were told to take me home
and try to keep me comfortable
until I died.
My parents, in fact
my entire family's lives,
became consumed by taking care of me
the best they knew how.
Their friends drifted away.
One year turned to two,
two turned to three.
It seemed like the person I once was
began to disappear.
The Lego blocks and electronic circuits
I'd loved as a boy were put away.
I had been moved out of my bedroom
into another more practical one.
I had become a ghost,
a faded memory of a boy
people once knew and loved.
Meanwhile, my mind began
knitting itself back together.
Gradually, my awareness started to return.
But no one realized
that I had come back to life.
I was aware of everything,
just like any normal person.
I could see and understand everything,
but I couldn't find a way
to let anybody know.
My personality was entombed
within a seemingly silent body,
a vibrant mind hidden in plain sight
within a chrysalis.
The stark reality hit me
that I was going to spend
the rest of my life locked inside myself,
totally alone.
I was trapped with only
my thoughts for company.
I would never be rescued.
No one would ever show me tenderness.
I would never talk to a friend.
No one would ever love me.
I had no dreams, no hope,
nothing to look forward to.
Well, nothing pleasant.
I lived in fear,
and, to put it bluntly,
was waiting for death
to finally release me,
expecting to die all alone in a care home.
I don't know if it's truly possible
to express in words
what it's like not to be able
to communicate.
Your personality appears
to vanish into a heavy fog
and all of your emotions and desires are
constricted, stifled and muted within you.
For me, the worst was the feeling
of utter powerlessness.
I simply existed.
It's a very dark place to find yourself
because in a sense, you have vanished.
Other people controlled
every aspect of my life.
They decided what I ate and when.
Whether I was laid on my side
or strapped into my wheelchair.
I often spent my days
positioned in front of the TV
watching Barney reruns.
I think because Barney
is so happy and jolly,
and I absolutely wasn't,
it made it so much worse.
I was completely powerless
to change anything in my life
or people's perceptions of me.
I was a silent, invisible observer
of how people behaved
when they thought no one was watching.
Unfortunately, I wasn't only an observer.
With no way to communicate,
I became the perfect victim:
a defenseless object,
seemingly devoid of feelings
that people used
to play out their darkest desires.
For more than 10 years,
people who were charged with my care
abused me physically,
verbally and sexually.
Despite what they thought, I did feel.
The first time it happened,
I was shocked and filled with disbelief.
How could they do this to me?
I was confused.
What had I done to deserve this?
Part of me wanted to cry
and another part wanted to fight.
Hurt, sadness and anger
flooded through me.
I felt worthless.
There was no one to comfort me.
But neither of my parents
knew this was happening.
I lived in terror, knowing
it would happen again and again.
I just never knew when.
All I knew was that I would
never be the same.
I remember once listening
to Whitney Houston singing,
"No matter what they take from me,
they can't take away my dignity."
And I thought to myself,
"You want to bet?"
Perhaps my parents could have
found out and could have helped.
But the years of constant caretaking,
having to wake up
every two hours to turn me,
combined with them essentially
grieving the loss of their son,
had taken a toll on my mother and father.
Following yet another heated argument
between my parents,
in a moment of despair and desperation,
my mother turned to me
and told me that I should die.
I was shocked, but as I thought
about what she had said,
I was filled with enormous compassion
and love for my mother,
yet I could do nothing about it.
There were many moments when I gave up,
sinking into a dark abyss.
I remember one particularly low moment.
My dad left me alone in the car
while he quickly went
to buy something from the store.
A random stranger walked past,
looked at me and he smiled.
I may never know why, but that simple act,
the fleeting moment of human connection,
transformed how I was feeling,
making me want to keep going.
My existence was tortured by monotony,
a reality that was often too much to bear.
Alone with my thoughts,
I constructed intricate fantasies
about ants running across the floor.
I taught myself to tell the time
by noticing where the shadows were.
As I learned how the shadows moved
as the hours of the day passed,
I understood how long it would be
before I was picked up and taken home.
Seeing my father walk
through the door to collect me
was the best moment of the day.
My mind became a tool that I could use
to either close down
to retreat from my reality
or enlarge into a gigantic space
that I could fill with fantasies.
I hoped that my reality would change
and someone would see
that I had come back to life.
But I had been washed away
like a sand castle
built too close to the waves,
and in my place was the person
people expected me to be.
To some I was Martin,
a vacant shell, the vegetable,
deserving of harsh words,
dismissal and even abuse.
To others, I was the tragically
brain-damaged boy
who had grown to become a man.
Someone they were kind to and cared for.
Good or bad, I was a blank canvas
onto which different versions
of myself were projected.
It took someone new
to see me in a different way.
An aromatherapist began coming
to the care home about once a week.
Whether through intuition
or her attention to details
that others failed to notice,
she became convinced that I could
understand what was being said.
She urged my parents
to have me tested by experts
in augmentative
and alternative communication.
And within a year,
I was beginning to use
a computer program to communicate.
It was exhilarating,
but frustrating at times.
I had so many words in my mind,
that I couldn't wait
to be able to share them.
Sometimes, I would say things to myself
simply because I could.
In myself, I had a ready audience,
and I believed that by expressing
my thoughts and wishes,
others would listen, too.
But as I began to communicate more,
I realized that it was in fact
only just the beginning
of creating a new voice for myself.
I was thrust into a world
I didn't quite know how to function in.
I stopped going to the care home
and managed to get my first job
making photocopies.
As simple as this may sound,
it was amazing.
My new world was really exciting
but often quite overwhelming
and frightening.
I was like a man-child,
and as liberating as it often was,
I struggled.
I also learned that many of those
who had known me for a long time
found it impossible to abandon the idea
of Martin they had in their heads.
While those I had only just met
struggled to look past the image
of a silent man in a wheelchair.
I realized that some people
would only listen to me
if what I said was in line
with what they expected.
Otherwise, it was disregarded
and they did what they felt was best.
I discovered that true communication
is about more than merely
physically conveying a message.
It is about getting the message
heard and respected.
Still, things were going well.
My body was slowly getting stronger.
I had a job in computing that I loved,
and had even got Kojak, the dog
I had been dreaming about for years.
However, I longed to share
my life with someone.
I remember staring out the window
as my dad drove me home from work,
thinking I have so much love inside of me
and nobody to give it to.
Just as I had resigned myself
to being single for the rest of my life,
I met Joan.
Not only is she the best thing
that has ever happened to me,
but Joan helped me to challenge
my own misconceptions about myself.
Joan said it was through my words
that she fell in love with me.
However, after all I had been through,
I still couldn't shake the belief
that nobody could truly see
beyond my disability
and accept me for who I am.
I also really struggled
to comprehend that I was a man.
The first time someone
referred to me as a man,
it stopped me in my tracks.
I felt like looking around
and asking, "Who, me?"
That all changed with Joan.
We have an amazing connection
and I learned how important it is
to communicate openly and honestly.
I felt safe, and it gave me the confidence
to truly say what I thought.
I started to feel whole again,
a man worthy of love.
I began to reshape my destiny.
I spoke up a little more at work.
I asserted my need for independence
to the people around me.
Being given a means of communication
changed everything.
I used the power of words and will
to challenge the preconceptions
of those around me
and those I had of myself.
Communication is what makes us human,
enabling us to connect
on the deepest level
with those around us --
telling our own stories,
expressing wants, needs and desires,
or hearing those of others
by really listening.
All this is how the world
knows who we are.
So who are we without it?
True communication increases understanding
and creates a more caring
and compassionate world.
Once, I was perceived
to be an inanimate object,
a mindless phantom
of a boy in a wheelchair.
Today, I am so much more.
A husband, a son, a friend,
a brother, a business owner,
a first-class honors graduate,
a keen amateur photographer.
It is my ability to communicate
that has given me all this.
We are told that actions
speak louder than words.
But I wonder,
do they?
Our words, however we communicate them,
are just as powerful.
Whether we speak the words
with our own voices,
type them with our eyes,
or communicate them non-verbally
to someone who speaks them for us,
words are among our most powerful tools.
I have come to you through
a terrible darkness,
pulled from it by caring souls
and by language itself.
The act of you listening to me today
brings me farther into the light.
We are shining here together.
If there is one most difficult obstacle
to my way of communicating,
it is that sometimes I want to shout
and other times simply to whisper
a word of love or gratitude.
It all sounds the same.
But if you will,
please imagine these next two words
as warmly as you can:
Thank you.
(Applause)
Clearly, we're living in a moment of crisis.
Arguably the financial markets have failed us
and the aid system is failing us,
and yet I stand firmly with the optimists
who believe that there has probably never been a more exciting moment to be alive.
Because of some of technologies we've been talking about.
Because of the resources, the skills,
and certainly the surge of talent we're seeing all around the world,
with the mindset to create change.
And we've got a president who sees himself as a global citizen,
who recognizes that no longer is there a single superpower,
but that we've got to engage in a different way with the world.
And by definition, every one of you who is in this room
must consider yourself a global soul,
a global citizen.
You work on the front lines. And you've seen the best and the worst
that human beings can do for one another and to one another.
And no matter what country you live or work in,
you've also seen the extraordinary things that individuals are capable of,
even in their most ordinariness.
Today there is a raging debate
as to how best we lift people out of poverty,
how best we release their energies.
On the one hand, we have people that say
the aid system is so broken we need to throw it out.
And on the other we have people who say
the problem is that we need more aid.
And what I want to talk about is something that compliments both systems.
We call it patient capital.
The critics point to the 500 billion dollars spent
in Africa since 1970
and say, and what do we have but environmental degradation
and incredible levels of poverty, rampant corruption?
They use Mobutu as metaphor.
And their policy prescription is to
make government more accountable,
focus on the capital markets,
invest, don't give anything away.
On the other side, as I said, there are those who say
the problem is that we need more money.
That when it comes to the rich, we'll bail out
and we'll hand a lot of aid,
but when it comes to our poor brethren,
we want little to do with it.
They point to the successes of aid:
the eradication of smallpox,
and the distribution of tens of millions
of malaria bed nets and antiretrovirals.
Both sides are right.
And the problem is that neither side is listening to the other.
Even more problematic, they're not listening to
poor people themselves.
After 25 years of working on issues of
poverty and innovation,
it's true that there are probably no more market-oriented
individuals on the planet
than low-income people.
They must navigate markets daily,
making micro-decisions, dozens and dozens,
to move their way through society,
and yet if a single catastrophic health problem
impacts their family,
they could be put back into poverty, sometimes for generations.
And so we need both the market
and we need aid.
Patient capital works between,
and tries to take the best of both.
It's money that's invested in entrepreneurs who know their communities
and are building solutions
to healthcare, water, housing, alternative energy,
thinking of low income people not as passive recipients of charity,
but as individual customers, consumers, clients,
people who want to make decisions in their own lives.
Patient capital requires that we have
incredible tolerance for risk,
a long time horizon in terms of allowing those
entrepreneurs time to experiment,
to use the market as the best listening device that we have,
and the expectation of below-market returns,
but outsized social impact.
It recognizes that the market has its limitation,
and so patient capital also works
with smart subsidy to extend the benefits of a global economy
to include all people.
Now, entrepreneurs need patient capital
for three reasons.
First, they tend to work in markets
where people make one, two, three dollars a day
and they are making all of their decisions within that income level.
Second, the geographies in which they work
have terrible infrastructure --
no roads to speak of, sporadic electricity
and high levels of corruption.
Third, they are often creating markets.
Even if you're bringing clean water
for the first time into rural villages, it is something new.
And so many low-income people
have seen so many failed promises broken
and seen so many quacks and sporadic medicines offered to them
that building trust takes a lot of time,
takes a lot of patience.
It also requires being connected to a lot of management assistance.
Not only to build the systems,
the business models that allow us
to reach low income people in a sustainable way,
but to connect those business
to other markets, to governments, to corporations --
real partnerships if we want to get to scale.
I want to share one story
about an innovation called drip irrigation.
In 2002 I met this incredible entrepreneur
named Amitabha Sadangi from India,
who'd been working for 20 years with some of the poorest farmers on the planet.
And he was expressing his frustration
that the aid market had bypassed low-income farmers altogether,
despite the fact that 200 million farmers
alone in India make under a dollar a day.
They were creating subsidies
either for large farms,
or they were giving inputs to the farmers
that they thought they should use, rather than
that the farmers wanted to use.
At the same time Amitabha was
obsessed with this drip irrigation technology
that had been invented in Israel.
It was a way of bringing small amounts of water
directly to the stalk of the plant.
And it could transform
swaths of desert land into fields of emerald green.
But the market also had bypassed low income farmers,
because these systems were both too expensive,
and they were constructed for fields that were too large.
The average small village farmer
works on two acres or less.
And so, Amitabha decided that he would take that innovation
and he would redesign it from the perspective
of the poor farmers themselves,
because he spent so many years listening to what they needed
not what he thought that they should have.
And he used three fundamental principles.
The first one was miniaturization.
The drip irrigation system
had to be small enough that a farmer only had
to risk a quarter acre,
even if he had two,
because it was too frightening, given all that he had at stake.
Second, it had to be extremely affordable.
In other words, that risk on the quarter acre
needed to be repaid in a single harvest,
or else they wouldn't take the risk.
And third, it had to be what Amitabha calls
infinitely expandable.
What I mean is with the profits from the first quarter acre,
the farmers could buy a second
and a third and a fourth.
As of today, IDE India, Amitabha's organization,
has sold over 300,000 farmers these systems
and has seen their yields and incomes
double or triple on average,
but this didn't happen overnight.
In fact, when you go back to the beginning,
there were no private investors
who would be willing to take a risk on building a new technology
for a market class that made under a dollar a day,
that were known to be some of the most risk-averse people on the planet
and that were working in one of the riskiest sectors, agriculture.
And so we needed grants. And he used significant grants
to research, to experiment, to fail,
to innovate and try again.
And when he had a prototype
and had a better understanding of how to market to farmers,
that's when patient capital could come in.
And we helped him build a company, for profit,
that would build on IDE's knowledge,
and start looking at sales and exports,
and be able to tap into other kinds of capital.
Secondarily, we wanted to see if we could export
this drip irrigation and bring it into other countries.
And so we met Dr. Sono Khangharani in Pakistan.
And while, again, you needed patience
to move a technology for the poor
in India into Pakistan,
just to get the permits,
over time we were able to start a company
with Dr. Sono, who runs a large
community development organization in the Thar Desert,
which is one of the remote and poorest areas of the country.
And though that company has just started,
our assumption is that there too
we'll see the impact on millions.
But drip irrigation isn't the only innovation.
We're starting to see these happening all around the world.
In Arusha, Tanzania, A to Z Textile Manufacturing
has worked in partnership with us,
with UNICEF, with the Global Fund,
to create a factory that now employs 7,000 people, mostly women.
And they produce 20 million lifesaving bednets
for Africans around the world.
Lifespring Hospital
is a joint venture between Acumen and the government of India
to bring quality, affordable maternal health care
to low-income women,
and it's been so successful that it's currently building
a new hospital every 35 days.
And 1298 Ambulances decided that it was going to
reinvent a completely broken industry,
building an ambulance service in Bombay
that would use the technology of Google Earth,
a sliding scale pricing system
so that all people could have access,
and a severe and public decision
not to engage in any form of corruption.
So that in the terrorist attacks of November
they were the first responder,
and are now beginning to scale, because of partnership.
They've just won four government contracts to build off their 100 ambulances,
and are one of the largest and most effective ambulance companies
in India.
This idea of scale is critical.
Because we're starting to see these enterprises
reach hundreds of thousands of people. All of the ones I discussed
have reached at least a quarter million people.
But that's obviously not enough.
And it's where the idea of partnership
becomes so important.
Whether it's by finding those innovations
that can access the capital markets,
government itself, or partner with major corporations,
there is unbelievable opportunity for innovation.
President Obama understands that.
He recently authorized the creation of a Social Innovation Fund
to focus on what works in this country,
and look at how we can scale it.
And I would submit that it's time to consider
a global innovation fund
that would find these entrepreneurs around the world
who really have innovations, not only for their country,
but ones that we can use in the developed world as well.
Invest financial assistance, but also management assistance.
And then measure the returns,
both from a financial perspective
and from a social impact perspective.
When we think about new approaches to aid,
it's impossible not to talk about Pakistan.
We've had a rocky relationship with that country
and, in all fairness,
the United States has not always been a very reliable partner.
But again I would say that this is our moment
for extraordinary things to happen.
And if we take that notion of a global innovation fund,
we could use this time to invest
not directly in government, though we would have government's blessing,
nor in international experts,
but in the many existing entrepreneurs
and civil society leaders
who already are building wonderful innovations
that are reaching people all across the country.
People like Rashani Zafar,
who created one of the largest microfinance banks in the country,
and is a real role model for women inside and outside the country.
And Tasneem Siddiqui, who developed a way
called incremental housing,
where he has moved 40,000 slum dwellers
into safe, affordable community housing.
Educational initiatives like DIL and The Citizen Foundation
that are building schools across the country.
It's not hyperbole
to say that these civil society institutions
and these social entrepreneurs
are building real alternatives to the Taliban.
I've invested in Pakistan for over seven years now,
and those of you who've also worked there
can attest that Pakistanis are an incredibly hard working population,
and there is a fierce upward mobility in their very nature.
President Kennedy said that
those who make peaceful revolution impossible
make violent revolution inevitable.
I would say that the converse is true.
That these social leaders
who really are looking at innovation
and extending opportunity
to the 70 percent of Pakistanis who make less than two dollars a day,
provide real pathways to hope.
And as we think about how we construct aid for Pakistan,
while we need to strengthen the judiciary,
build greater stability,
we also need to think about lifting those leaders
who can be role models for the rest of the world.
On one of my last visits to Pakistan,
I asked Dr. Sono if he would take me
to see some of the drip irrigation in the Thar Desert.
And we left Karachi one morning before dawn.
It was about 115 degrees.
And we drove for eight hours
along this moonscape-like landscape
with very little color, lots of heat,
very little discussion, because we were exhausted.
And finally, at the end of the journey,
I could see this thin little yellow line across the horizon.
And as we got closer, its significance became apparent.
That there in the desert
was a field of sunflowers growing seven feet tall.
Because one of the poorest farmers on Earth
had gotten access to a technology
that had allowed him to change his own life.
His name was Raja,
and he had kind, twinkly hazel eyes
and warm expressive hands
that reminded me of my father.
And he said it was the first dry season
in his entire life that he hadn't taken
his 12 children and 50 grandchildren
on a two day journey across the desert
to work as day laborers at a commercial farm
for about 50 cents a day.
Because he was building these crops.
And with the money he earned he could stay this year.
And for the first time ever in three generations,
his children would go to school.
We asked him if he would send his daughters as well as his sons.
And he said, "Of course I will.
Because I don't want them discriminated against anymore."
When we think about solutions to poverty,
we cannot deny individuals
their fundamental dignity.
Because at the end of the day,
dignity is more important to the human spirit than wealth.
And what's exciting is to see so many entrepreneurs across sectors
who are building innovations that recognize
that what people want is freedom
and choice and opportunity.
Because that is where dignity really starts.
Martin Luther King said that
love without power is anemic and sentimental,
and that power without love
is reckless and abusive.
Our generation has seen both approaches tried,
and often fail.
But I think our generation also might be the first
to have the courage to embrace both love and power.
For that is what we'll need, as we move forward
to dream and imagine what it will really take
to build a global economy that includes all of us,
and to finally extend that fundamental proposition
that all men are created equal to every human being on the planet.
The time for us to begin innovating
and looking for new solutions, a cross sector, is now.
I can only talk from my own experience,
but in eight years of running Acumen fund,
I've seen the power of patient capital.
Not only to inspire innovation and risk taking,
but to truly build systems that have created
more than 25,000 jobs
and delivered tens of millions of services and products
to some of the poorest people on the planet.
I know it works.
But I know that many other kinds of innovation also work.
And so I urge you, in whatever sector you work,
in whatever job you do,
to start thinking about how we might
build solutions that start
from the perspective of those we're trying to help.
Rather than what we think that they might need.
It will take embracing the world with both arms.
And it will take living with the spirit of generosity and accountability,
with a sense of integrity and perseverance.
And yet these are the very qualities
for which men and women have been honored
throughout the generations.
And there is so much good that we can do.
Just think of all those sunflowers in the desert.
Thank you.
(Applause)
I was around 10 when one day,
I discovered a box
of my father's old things.
In it, under a bunch
of his college textbooks,
was a pair of black corduroy
bell-bottom pants.
These pants were awful --
musty and moth-eaten.
And of course, I fell in love with them.
I'd never seen anything like them.
Until that day,
all I'd ever known and worn
was my school uniform,
which, in fact, I was pretty grateful for,
because from quite a young age,
I'd realized I was somewhat different.
I'd never been one of the boys my age;
terrible at sports,
possibly the unmanliest little boy ever.
(Laughter)
I was bullied quite a bit.
And so, I figured that to survive
I would be invisible,
and the uniform helped me
to seem no different from any other child.
(Laughter)
Well, almost.
This became my daily prayer:
"God, please make me
just like everybody else."
I think this went straight
to God's voicemail, though.
(Laughter)
And eventually, it became pretty clear
that I was not growing up to be
the son that my father always wanted.
Sorry, Dad.
No, I was not going to magically change.
And over time, I grew less and less sure
that I actually wanted to.
Therefore, the day those black corduroy
bell-bottom pants came into my life,
something happened.
I didn't see pants;
I saw opportunity.
The very next day,
I had to wear them to school,
come what may.
And once I pulled on those god-awful pants
and belted them tight,
almost instantly, I developed
what can only be called a swagger.
(Laughter)
All the way to school,
and then all the way back
because I was sent home at once --
(Laughter)
I transformed into
a little brown rock star.
(Laughter)
I finally didn't care anymore
that I could not conform.
That day, I was suddenly celebrating it.
That day, instead of being invisible,
I chose to be looked at,
just by wearing something different.
That day, I discovered
the power of what we wear.
That day, I discovered
the power of fashion,
and I've been in love with it ever since.
Fashion can communicate our differences
to the world for us.
And with this simple act of truth,
I realized that these differences --
they stopped being our shame.
They became our expressions,
expressions of our very unique identities.
And we should express ourselves,
wear what we want.
What's the worst that could happen?
The fashion police are going to get you
for being so last season?
(Laughter)
Yeah.
Well, unless the fashion police
meant something entirely different.
Nobel Prize laureate Malala
survived Taliban extremists
in October 2012.
However, in October 2017,
she faced a different enemy,
when online trolls viciously
attacked the photograph
that showed the 20-year-old
wearing jeans that day.
The comments,
the hatred she received,
ranged from "How long
before the scarf comes off?"
to, and I quote,
"That's the reason the bullet
directly targeted her head
a long time ago."
Now, when most of us decide
to wear a pair of jeans
someplace like New York,
London, Milan, Paris,
we possibly don't stop
to think that it's a privilege;
something that somewhere else
can have consequences,
something that can one day
be taken away from us.
My grandmother was a woman
who took extraordinary pleasure
in dressing up.
Her fashion was colorful.
And the color she loved to wear so much
was possibly the only thing
that was truly about her,
the one thing she had agency over,
because like most other women
of her generation in India,
she'd never been allowed to exist
beyond what was dictated
by custom and tradition.
She'd been married at 17,
and after 65 years of marriage,
when my grandfather died suddenly one day,
her loss was unbearable.
But that day, she was going to lose
something else as well,
the one joy she had:
to wear color.
In India, according to custom,
when a Hindu woman becomes a widow,
all she's allowed to wear is white
from the day of the death of her husband.
No one made my grandmother wear white.
However, every woman she'd known
who had outlived her husband,
including her mother,
had done it.
This oppression was so internalized,
so deep-rooted,
that she herself refused a choice.
She passed away this year,
and until the day she died,
she continued to wear only white.
I have a photograph with her
from earlier, happier times.
In it, you can't really see
what she's wearing --
the photo is in black and white.
However, from the way she's smiling in it,
you just know she's wearing color.
This is also what fashion can do.
It has the power to fill us with joy,
the joy of freedom to choose for ourselves
how we want to look,
how we want to live --
a freedom worth fighting for.
And fighting for freedom, protest,
comes in many forms.
Widows in India like my grandmother,
thousands of them,
live in a city called Vrindavan.
And so, it's been a sea
of white for centuries.
However, only as recently as 2013,
the widows of Vrindavan
have started to celebrate Holi,
the Indian festival of color,
which they are prohibited
from participating in.
On this one day in March,
these women take the traditional
colored powder of the festival
and color each other.
With every handful of the powder
they throw into the air,
their white saris slowly start
to suffuse with color.
And they don't stop until
they're completely covered
in every hue of the rainbow
that's forbidden to them.
The color washes off the next day,
however, for that moment in time,
it's their beautiful disruption.
This disruption,
any kind of dissonance,
can be the first gauntlet we throw down
in a battle against oppression.
And fashion --
it can create visual disruption for us --
on us, literally.
Lessons of defiance
have always been taught
by fashion's great revolutionaries:
its designers.
Jean Paul Gaultier taught us
that women can be kings.
Thom Browne --
he taught us that men can wear heels.
And Alexander McQueen,
in his spring 1999 show,
had two giant robotic arms
in the middle of his runway.
And as the model, Shalom Harlow
began to spin in between them,
these two giant arms --
furtively at first and then furiously,
began to spray color onto her.
McQueen, thus,
before he took his own life,
taught us that this body
of ours is a canvas,
a canvas we get to paint however we want.
Somebody who loved this world of fashion
was Karar Nushi.
He was a student and actor from Iraq.
He loved his vibrant, eclectic clothes.
However, he soon started receiving
death threats for how he looked.
He remained unfazed.
He remained fabulous,
until July 2017,
when Karar was discovered dead
on a busy street in Baghdad.
He'd been kidnapped.
He'd been tortured.
And eyewitnesses say that his body
showed multiple wounds.
Stab wounds.
Two thousand miles away in Peshawar,
Pakistani transgender activist Alisha
was shot multiple times in May 2016.
She was taken to the hospital,
but because she dressed
in women's clothing,
she was refused access
to either the men's or the women's wards.
What we choose to wear can sometimes
be literally life and death.
And even in death,
we sometimes don't get to choose.
Alisha died that day
and then was buried as a man.
What kind of world is this?
Well, it's one in which
it's natural to be afraid,
to be frightened of this surveillance,
this violence against our bodies
and what we wear on them.
However, the greater fear
is that once we surrender,
blend in
and begin to disappear
one after the other,
the more normal this false
conformity will look,
the less shocking
this oppression will feel.
For the children we are raising,
the injustice of today could become
the ordinary of tomorrow.
They'll get used to this,
and they, too, might begin to see
anything different as dirty,
something to be hated,
something to be extinguished,
like lights to be put out,
one by one,
until darkness becomes a way of life.
However, if I today,
then you tomorrow,
maybe even more of us someday,
if we embrace our right
to look like ourselves,
then in the world that's been
violently whitewashed,
we will become the pinpricks
of color pushing through,
much like those widows of Vrindavan.
How then, with so many of us,
will the crosshairs of a gun
be able to pick out Karar,
Malala,
Alisha?
Can they kill us all?
The time is now to stand up,
to stand out.
Where sameness is safeness,
with something as simple as what we wear,
we can draw every eye to ourselves
to say that there are differences
in this world, and there always will be.
Get used to it.
And this we can say without a single word.
Fashion can give us
a language for dissent.
It can give us courage.
Fashion can let us literally wear
our courage on our sleeves.
So wear it.
Wear it like armor.
Wear it because it matters.
And wear it because you matter.
Thank you.
(Applause)
[A provocation from Danny Hillis:]
[It's time to start talking
about engineering our climate]
What if there was a way
to build a thermostat
that allowed you to turn down
the temperature of the earth
anytime you wanted?
Now, you would think if somebody
had a plausible idea about how to do that,
everybody would be very excited about it,
and there would be lots
of research on how to do it.
But in fact, a lot of people
do understand how to do that.
But there's not much support
for research in this area.
And I think part of it
is because there are some real
misunderstandings about it.
So I'm not going to try to convince you
today that this is a good idea.
But I am going to try to get
your curiosity going about it
and clear up some
of the misunderstandings.
So, the basic idea of solar geoengineering
is that we can cool things down
just by reflecting
a little bit more sunlight
back into space.
And ideas about how to do this
have been around literally for decades.
Clouds are a great way to do that,
these low-lying clouds.
Everybody knows it's cooler under a cloud.
I like this cloud because it has exactly
the same water content
as the transparent air around it.
And it just shows that even a little bit
of a change in the flow of the air
can cause a cloud to form.
We make artificial clouds all the time.
These are contrails,
which are artificial water clouds
that are made by the passing
of a jet engine.
And so, we're already changing
the clouds on earth.
By accident.
Or, if you like to believe it,
by supersecret government conspiracy.
(Laughter)
But we are already doing this quite a lot.
This is a NASA picture of shipping lanes.
Passing ships actually cause
clouds to form,
and this is a big enough effect
that it actually helps reduce
global warming already by about a degree.
So we already are doing solar engineering.
There's lots of ideas
about how to do this.
People have looked at everything,
from building giant parasols
out into space
to fizzing bubble waters in the ocean.
And some of these are actually
very plausible ideas.
One that was published recently
by David Keith at Harvard
is to take chalk and put dust
up into the stratosphere,
where it reflects off sunlight.
And that's a really neat idea,
because chalk is one of the most
common minerals on earth,
and it's very safe -- it's so safe,
we put it into baby food.
And basically, if you throw chalk
up into the stratosphere,
it comes down in a couple of years
all by itself, dissolved in rainwater.
Now, before you start worrying
about all this chalk in your rainwater,
let me explain to you
how little of it it actually takes.
And that turns out to be
very easy to calculate.
This is a back-of-the-envelope
calculation I made.
(Laughter)
(Applause)
I assure you, people have done
much more careful calculations,
and it comes out with the same answer,
which is that you have to put chalk up
at the rate of about 10 teragrams a year
to undo the effects of the CO2
that we've already done --
just in terms of temperature,
not all the effects, but the temperature.
So what does that look like?
I can't visualize 10 teragrams per year.
So I asked the Cambridge
Fire Department and Taylor Milsal
to lend me a hand.
This is a hose pumping water
at 10 teragrams a year.
And that is how much
you would have to pump
into the stratosphere
to cool the earth back down
to pre-industrial levels.
And it's amazingly little;
it's like one hose for the entire earth.
Now of course, you wouldn't
really use a hose,
you'd fly it up in airplanes
or something like that.
But it's so little, it would be like
putting a handful of chalk
into every Olympic
swimming pool full of rain.
It's almost nothing.
So why don't people like this idea?
Why isn't it taken more seriously?
And there are some
very good reasons for that.
A lot of people really don't think
we should be talking about this at all.
And, in fact, I have some
very good friends in the audience
who I respect a lot,
who really don't think
I should be talking about this.
And the reason is that they're concerned
that if people imagine
there's some easy way out,
that we won't give up
our addiction to fossil fuels.
And I do worry about that.
I think it's actually a serious problem.
But there's also, I think,
a deeper problem,
which is: nobody likes the idea
of messing with the entire earth --
I certainly don't.
I love this planet, I really do.
And I don't want to mess with it.
But we're already changing our atmosphere,
we're already messing with it.
And so I think it makes sense
for us to look for ways
to mitigate that impact.
And we need to do research to do that.
We need to understand
the science behind that.
I've noticed that there's a theme
that's kind of developed at TED,
which is kind of, "fear versus hope,"
or "creativity versus caution."
And of course, we need both of those.
So there aren't any silver bullets.
This is certainly not a silver bullet.
But we need science to tell us
what our options are;
that informs both
our creativity and our caution.
So I am an optimist
about our future selves,
but I'm not an optimist
because I think our problems are small.
I'm an optimist because I think
our capacity to deal with our problems
is much greater than we imagine.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
This talk sparked
a lot of controversy at TED2017,
and we encourage you
to look at discussions online
to see other points of view.
I'd like you to ask yourself,
what do you feel when you hear
the words "organic chemistry?"
What comes to mind?
There is a course offered
at nearly every university,
and it's called Organic Chemistry,
and it is a grueling, heavy
introduction to the subject,
a flood of content
that overwhelms students,
and you have to ace it if you want
to become a doctor or a dentist
or a veterinarian.
And that is why so many students
perceive this science like this ...
as an obstacle in their path,
and they fear it and they hate it
and they call it a weed-out course.
What a cruel thing for a subject
to do to young people,
weed them out.
And this perception spread
beyond college campuses long ago.
There is a universal anxiety
about these two words.
I happen to love this science,
and I think this position
in which we have placed it
is inexcusable.
It's not good for science,
and it's not good for society,
and I don't think it has to be this way.
And I don't mean that this class
should be easier. It shouldn't.
But your perception of these two words
should not be defined
by the experiences of premed students
who frankly are going through
a very anxious time of their lives.
So I'm here today because I believe
that a basic knowledge
of organic chemistry is valuable,
and I think that it can be made
accessible to everybody,
and I'd like to prove that to you today.
Would you let me try?
Audience: Yeah!
Jakob Magolan: All right, let's go for it.
(Laughter)
Here I have one of these
overpriced EpiPens.
Inside it is a drug called epinephrine.
Epinephrine can restart
the beat of my heart,
or it could stop a life-threatening
allergic reaction.
An injection of this
right here will do it.
It would be like turning
the ignition switch
in my body's fight-or-flight machinery.
My heart rate, my blood pressure would
go up so blood could rush to my muscles.
My pupils would dilate.
I would feel a wave of strength.
Epinephrine has been the difference
between life and death for many people.
This is like a little miracle
that you can hold in your fingers.
Here is the chemical structure
of epinephrine.
This is what organic chemistry looks like.
It looks like lines and letters ...
No meaning to most people.
I'd like to show you what I see
when I look at that picture.
I see a physical object
that has depth and rotating parts,
and it's moving.
We call this a compound or a molecule,
and it is 26 atoms that are stitched
together by atomic bonds.
The unique arrangement of these atoms
gives epinephrine its identity,
but nobody has ever
actually seen one of these,
because they're very small,
so we're going to call this
an artistic impression,
and I want to explain to you
how small this is.
In here, I have less than
half a milligram of it dissolved in water.
It's the mass of a grain of sand.
The number of epinephrine
molecules in here is one quintillion.
That's 18 zeroes.
That number is hard to visualize.
Seven billion of us on this planet?
Maybe 400 billion stars in our galaxy?
You're not even close.
If you wanted to get
into the right ballpark,
you'd have to imagine every grain of sand
on every beach,
under all the oceans and lakes,
and then shrink them all
so they fit in here.
Epinephrine is so small
we will never see it,
not through any microscope ever,
but we know what it looks like,
because it shows itself
through some sophisticated machines
with fancy names
like "nuclear magnetic
resonance spectrometers."
So visible or not, we know
this molecule very well.
We know it is made
of four different types of atoms,
hydrogen, carbon, oxygen and nitrogen.
These are the colors
we typically use for them.
Everything in our universe
is made of little spheres
that we call atoms.
There's about a hundred
of these basic ingredients,
and they're all made
from three smaller particles:
protons, neutrons, electrons.
We arrange these atoms
into this familiar table.
We give them each a name and a number.
But life as we know it
doesn't need all of these,
just a smaller subset, just these.
And there are four atoms in particular
that stand apart from the rest
as the main building blocks of life,
and they are the same ones
that are found in epinephrine:
hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen and oxygen.
Now what I tell you next
is the most important part.
When these atoms
connect to form molecules,
they follow a set of rules.
Hydrogen makes one bond,
oxygen always makes two,
nitrogen makes three
and carbon makes four.
That's it.
HONC -- one, two, three, four.
If you can count to four,
and you can misspell the word "honk,"
you're going to remember this
for the rest of your lives.
(Laughter)
Now here I have four bowls
with these ingredients.
We can use these to build molecules.
Let's start with epinephrine.
Now, these bonds between atoms,
they're made of electrons.
Atoms use electrons like arms
to reach out and hold their neighbors.
Two electrons in each bond,
like a handshake,
and like a handshake,
they are not permanent.
They can let go of one atom
and grab another.
That's what we call a chemical reaction,
when atoms exchange partners
and make new molecules.
The backbone of epinephrine
is made mostly of carbon atoms,
and that's common.
Carbon is life's favorite
structural building material,
because it makes
a good number of handshakes
with just the right grip strength.
That's why we define organic chemistry
as the study of carbon molecules.
Now, if we build the smallest molecules
we can think of that follow our rules,
they highlight our rules,
and they have familiar names:
water, ammonia and methane,
H20 and NH3 and CH4.
The words "hydrogen,"
"oxygen" and "nitrogen" --
we use the same words
to name these three molecules
that have two atoms each.
They still follow the rules,
because they have one, two
and three bonds between them.
That's why oxygen gets called O2.
I can show you combustion.
Here's carbon dioxide, CO2.
Above it, let's place water and oxygen,
and beside it, some flammable fuels.
These fuels are made
of just hydrogen and carbon.
That's why we call them hydrocarbons.
We're very creative.
(Laughter)
So when these crash
into molecules of oxygen,
as they do in your engine
or in your barbecues,
they release energy and they reassemble,
and every carbon atom
ends up at the center of a CO2 molecule,
holding on to two oxygens,
and all the hydrogens end up
as parts of waters,
and everybody follows the rules.
They are not optional,
and they're not optional
for bigger molecules either,
like these three.
This is our favorite vitamin
sitting next to our favorite drug,
(Laughter)
and morphine is one of the most
important stories in medical history.
It marks medicine's first
real triumph over physical pain,
and every molecule has a story,
and they are all published.
They're written by scientists,
and they're read by other scientists,
so we have handy representations
to do this quickly on paper,
and I need to teach you how to do that.
So we lay epinephrine flat on a page,
and then we replace all the spheres
with simple letters,
and then the bonds
that lie in the plane of the page,
they just become regular lines,
and the bonds that point
forwards and backwards,
they become little triangles,
either solid or dashed to indicate depth.
We don't actually draw these carbons.
We save time by just hiding them.
They're represented
by corners between the bonds,
and we also hide every hydrogen
that's bonded to a carbon.
We know they're there
whenever a carbon is showing us
any fewer than four bonds.
The last thing that's done
is the bonds between OH and NH.
We just get rid of those
to make it cleaner,
and that's all there is to it.
This is the professional way
to draw molecules.
This is what you see on Wikipedia pages.
It takes a little bit of practice,
but I think everyone here could do it,
but for today, this is epinephrine.
This is also called adrenaline.
They're one and the same.
It's made by your adrenal glands.
You have this molecule swimming
through your body right now.
It's a natural molecule.
This EpiPen would just give you
a quick quintillion more of them.
(Laughter)
We can extract epinephrine
from the adrenal glands
of sheep or cattle,
but that's not
where this stuff comes from.
We make this epinephrine in a factory
by stitching together smaller molecules
that come mostly from petroleum.
And this is 100 percent synthetic.
And that word, "synthetic,"
makes some of us uncomfortable.
It's not like the word "natural,"
which makes us feel safe.
But these two molecules,
they cannot be distinguished.
We're not talking about two cars
that are coming off an assembly line here.
A car can have a scratch on it,
and you can't scratch an atom.
These two are identical in a surreal,
almost mathematical sense.
At this atomic scale,
math practically touches reality.
And a molecule of epinephrine ...
it has no memory of its origin.
It just is what it is,
and once you have it,
the words "natural" and "synthetic,"
they don't matter,
and nature synthesizes
this molecule just like we do,
except nature is much better
at this than we are.
Before there was life on earth,
all the molecules were small, simple:
carbon dioxide, water, nitrogen,
just simple things.
The emergence of life changed that.
Life brought biosynthetic factories
that are powered by sunlight,
and inside these factories,
small molecules crash into each other
and become large ones:
carbohydrates, proteins, nucleic acids,
multitudes of spectacular creations.
Nature is the original organic chemist,
and her construction also fills our sky
with the oxygen gas we breathe,
this high-energy oxygen.
All of these molecules are infused
with the energy of the sun.
They store it like batteries.
So nature is made of chemicals.
Maybe you guys can help me
to reclaim this word, "chemical,"
because it has been stolen from us.
It doesn't mean toxic,
and it doesn't mean harmful,
and it doesn't mean man-made or unnatural.
It just means "stuff," OK?
(Laughter)
You can't have
chemical-free lump charcoal.
That is ridiculous.
(Laughter)
And I'd like to do one more word.
The word "natural" doesn't mean "safe,"
and you all know that.
Plenty of nature's
chemicals are quite toxic,
and others are delicious,
and some are both ...
(Laughter)
toxic and delicious.
The only way to tell
whether something is harmful
is to test it,
and I don't mean you guys.
Professional toxicologists:
we have these people.
They're well-trained,
and you should trust them like I do.
So nature's molecules are everywhere,
including the ones that have decomposed
into these black mixtures
that we call petroleum.
We refine these molecules.
There's nothing unnatural about them.
We purify them.
Now, our dependence on them for energy --
that means that every one of those carbons
gets converted into a molecule of CO2.
That's a greenhouse gas
that is messing up our climate.
Maybe knowing this chemistry
will make that reality easier to accept
for some people, I don't know,
but these molecules
are not just fossil fuels.
They're also the cheapest
available raw materials
for doing something
that we call synthesis.
We're using them like pieces of LEGO.
We have learned how to connect them
or break them apart with great control.
I have done a lot of this myself,
and I still think it's amazing
it's even possible.
What we do is kind of like assembling LEGO
by dumping boxes of it
into washing machines,
but it works.
We can make molecules that are
exact copies of nature, like epinephrine,
or we can make creations of our own
from scratch, like these two.
One of these eases the symptoms
of multiple sclerosis;
the other one cures a type of blood cancer
that we call T-cell lymphoma.
A molecule with the right size and shape,
it's like a key in a lock,
and when it fits, it interferes
with the chemistry of a disease.
That's how drugs work.
Natural or synthetic,
they're all just molecules that happen
to fit snugly somewhere important.
But nature is much better
at making them than we are,
so hers look more impressive than ours,
like this one.
This is called vancomycin.
She gave this majestic beast
two chlorine atoms
to wear like a pair of earrings.
We found vancomycin in a puddle of mud
in a jungle in Borneo in 1953.
It's made by a bacteria.
We can't synthesize this
cost-efficiently in a lab.
It's too complicated for us, but we
can harvest it from its natural source,
and we do, because this is
one of our most powerful antibiotics.
And new molecules are reported
in our literature every day.
We make them or we find them
in every corner of this planet.
And that's where drugs come from,
and that's why your doctors
have amazing powers ...
(Laughter)
to cure deadly infections
and everything else.
Being a physician today
is like being a knight in shining armor.
They fight battles
with courage and composure,
but also with good equipment.
So let's not forget the role
of the blacksmith in this picture,
because without the blacksmith,
things would look a little different ...
(Laughter)
But this science is bigger than medicine.
It is oils and solvents and flavors,
fabrics, all plastics,
the cushions that
you're sitting on right now --
they're all manufactured,
and they're mostly carbon,
so that makes all of it organic chemistry.
This is a rich science.
I left out a lot today:
phosphorus and sulfur and the other atoms,
and why they all bond the way they do,
and symmetry
and non-bonding electrons,
and atoms that are charged,
and reactions and their mechanisms,
and it goes on and on and on,
and synthesis takes a long time to learn.
But I didn't come here to teach
you guys organic chemistry --
I just wanted to show it to you,
and I had a lot of help with that today
from a young man named Weston Durland,
and you've already seen him.
He's an undergraduate
student in chemistry,
and he also happens to be
pretty good with computer graphics.
(Laughter)
So Weston designed
all the moving molecules
that you saw today.
He and I wanted to demonstrate
through the use of graphics like these
to help someone talk
about this intricate science.
But our main goal was just to show you
that organic chemistry
is not something to be afraid of.
It is, at its core, a window
through which the beauty
of the natural world looks richer.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Hi. Today, I'm going to take you through glimpses
of about eight of my projects,
done in collaboration with Danish artist Soren Pors.
We call ourselves Pors and Rao,
and we live and work in India.
I'd like to begin with my very first object,
which I call "The Uncle Phone."
And it was inspired by my uncle's peculiar habit
of constantly asking me to do things for him,
almost like I were an extension of his body --
to turn on the lights or to bring him a glass of water,
a pack of cigarettes.
And as I grew up, it became worse and worse,
And I started to think of it as a form of control.
But of course, I could never say anything,
because the uncle is a respected figure
in the Indian family.
And the situation that irked me and mystified me the most
was his use of a landline telephone.
He would hold on to the receiver and expect me to dial a number for him.
And so as a response and as a gift to my uncle,
I made him "The Uncle Phone."
It's so long that it requires two people to use it.
It's exactly the way my uncle uses a phone that's designed for one person.
But the problem is that, when I left home and went to college,
I started missing his commands.
And so I made him a golden typewriter
through which he could dispense his commands
to nephews and nieces around the world as an email.
So what he had to do was take a piece of paper, roll it into the carriage,
type his email or command and pull the paper out.
This device would automatically send the intended person
the letter as an email.
So here you can see, we embedded a lot of electronics
that understands all of the mechanical actions
and converts it to digital.
So my uncle is only dealing with a mechanical interface.
And of course, the object had to be very grand and have a sense of ritualism,
the way my uncle likes it.
The next work is a sound-sensitive installation
that we affectionately call "The Pygmies."
And we wanted to work with a notion of being
surrounded by a tribe of very shy, sensitive and sweet creatures.
So how it works is we have these panels, which we have on the wall,
and behind them, we have these little creatures which hide.
And as soon as it's silent, they sort of creep out.
And if it's even more silent, they stretch their necks out.
And at the slightest sound, they hide back again.
So we had these panels on three walls of a room.
And we had over 500 of these little pygmies hiding behind them.
So this is how it works.
This is a video prototype.
So when it's quiet, it's sort of coming out from behind the panels.
And they hear like humans do, or real creatures do.
So they get immune to sounds that scare them after awhile.
And they don't react to background sounds.
You'll hear a train in moment that they don't react to.
(Noise)
But they react to foreground sounds. You'll hear that in a second.
(Whistling)
So we worked very hard
to make them as lifelike as possible.
So each pygmy has its own behavior, psyche,
mood swings, personalities and so on.
So this is a very early prototype.
Of course, it got much better after that.
And we made them react to people,
but we found that people were being quite playful and childlike with them.
This is a video installation called "The Missing Person."
And we were quite intrigued
with playing with the notion of invisibility.
How would it be possible to experience a sense of invisibility?
So we worked with a company
that specializes in camera surveillance,
and we asked them to develop a piece of software with us,
using a camera
that could look at people in the room, track them
and replace one person with the background, rendering them invisible.
So I'm just going to show you a very early prototype.
On the right side you can see my colleague Soren,
who's actually in the space.
And on the left side, you'll see the processed video
where the camera has made him invisible.
Soren enters the room. Pop! He goes invisible.
And you can see that the camera is tracking him and erasing.
It's a very early video,
so we haven't yet dealt with the overlap and all of that,
but that got refined pretty soon, later.
So how we used it was in a room where we had a camera looking into the space,
and we had one monitor, one on each wall.
And as people walked into the room,
they would see themselves in the monitor, except with one difference:
one person was constantly invisible
wherever they moved in the room.
So this is a work called "The Sun Shadow."
And it was almost like a sheet of paper,
like a cutout of a childlike drawing
of an oil spill or a sun.
And from the front, this object appeared to be very strong and robust,
and from the side, it almost seemed very weak.
So people would walking into the room and they'd almost ignore it,
thinking it was some crap laying around.
But as soon as they passed by,
it would start to climb up the wall in jerky fashion.
And it would get exhausted, and it would collapse every time.
(Laughter)
So this work
is a caricature of an upside-down man.
His head is so heavy, full of heavy thoughts,
that it's sort of fallen into his hat,
and his body's grown out of him almost like a plant.
Well what he does is he moves around
in a very drunken fashion on his head
in a very unpredictable and extremely slow movement.
And it's kind of constrained by that circle.
Because if that circle weren't there, and the floor was very even,
it would start to wander about in the space.
And there's no wires.
So I'll just show you an instance --
so when people enter the room, it activates this object.
And it very slowly, over a few minutes,
sort of painfully goes up,
and then it gains momentum
and it looks like it's almost about to fall.
And this is an important moment,
because we wanted to instill in the viewer
an instinct to almost go and help, or save the subject.
But it doesn't really need it,
because it, again, sort of manages to pull itself up.
So this work was a real technical challenge for us,
and we worked very hard, like most of our works, over years
to get the mechanics right and the equilibrium and the dynamics.
And it was very important for us
to establish the exact moment that it would fall,
because if we made it in a way that it would topple over,
then it would damage itself,
and if it didn't fall enough, it wouldn't instill that fatalism,
or that sense of wanting to go and help it.
So I'm going to show you a very quick video
where we are doing a test scenario -- it's much faster.
That's my colleague. He's let it go.
Now he's getting nervous, so he's going to go catch it.
But he doesn't need to,
because it manages to lift itself up on its own.
So this is a work that we were very intrigued with,
working with the aesthetic of fur
embedded with thousands of tiny different sizes
of fiber optics, which twinkle like the night sky.
And it's at the scale of the night sky.
So we wrapped this around a blob-like form,
which is in the shape of a teddy bear,
which was hanging from the ceiling.
And the idea was to sort of contrast
something very cold and distant and abstract like the universe
into the familiar form of a teddy bear,
which is very comforting and intimate.
And the idea was that at some point
you would stop looking at the form of a teddy bear
and you would almost perceive it to be a hole in the space,
and as if you were looking out into the twinkling night sky.
So this is the last work, and a work in progress,
and it's called "Space Filler."
Well imagine a small cube that's about this big
standing in front of you in the middle of the room,
and as you approached it, it tried to intimidate you
by growing into a cube
that's twice its height and [eight] times its volume.
And so this object is constantly expanding and contracting
to create a dynamic with people moving around it --
almost like it were trying
to conceal a secret within its seams or something.
So we work with a lot of technology,
but we don't really love technology,
because it gives us a lot of pain in our work over years and years.
But we use it because we're interested
in the way that it can help us
to express the emotions and behavioral patterns
in these creatures that we create.
And once a creature pops into our minds,
it's almost like the process of creation
is to discover the way this creature really wants to exist
and what form it wants to take and what way it wants to move.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Probably a lot of you know
the story of the two salesmen
who went down to Africa in the 1900s.
They were sent down to find
if there was any opportunity
for selling shoes,
and they wrote telegrams
back to Manchester.
And one of them wrote,
"Situation hopeless. Stop.
They don't wear shoes."
And the other one wrote,
"Glorious opportunity.
They don't have any shoes yet."
(Laughter)
Now, there's a similar situation
in the classical music world,
because there are some people who think
that classical music is dying.
And there are some of us
who think you ain't seen nothing yet.
And rather than go
into statistics and trends,
and tell you about all the orchestras
that are closing,
and the record companies that are folding,
I thought we should do
an experiment tonight.
Actually, it's not really an experiment,
because I know the outcome.
(Laughter)
But it's like an experiment.
Now, before we start --
(Laughter)
Before we start, I need to do two things.
One is I want to remind you
of what a seven-year-old child
sounds like when he plays the piano.
Maybe you have this child at home.
He sounds something like this.
(Music)
(Music ends)
I see some of you recognize this child.
Now, if he practices for a year
and takes lessons, he's now eight
and he sounds like this.
(Music)
(Music ends)
He practices for another year
and takes lessons -- he's nine.
(Music)
(Music ends)
Then he practices for another year
and takes lessons -- now he's 10.
(Music)
(Music ends)
At that point, they usually give up.
(Laughter)
(Applause)
Now, if you'd waited for one more year,
you would have heard this.
(Music)
(Music ends)
Now, what happened was not
maybe what you thought,
which is, he suddenly
became passionate, engaged,
involved, got a new teacher,
he hit puberty, or whatever it is.
What actually happened
was the impulses were reduced.
You see, the first time, he was playing
with an impulse on every note.
(Music)
And the second,
with an impulse every other note.
(Music)
You can see it by looking at my head.
(Laughter)
The nine-year-old put
an impulse on every four notes.
(Music)
The 10-year-old, on every eight notes.
(Music)
And the 11-year-old,
one impulse on the whole phrase.
(Music)
I don't know how
we got into this position.
(Laughter)
I didn't say, "I'm going to move
my shoulder over, move my body."
No, the music pushed me over,
which is why I call it
one-buttock playing.
(Music)
It can be the other buttock.
(Music)
You know, a gentleman was once
watching a presentation I was doing,
when I was working with a young pianist.
He was the president
of a corporation in Ohio.
I was working with
this young pianist, and said,
"The trouble with you
is you're a two-buttock player.
You should be a one-buttock player."
I moved his body while he was playing.
And suddenly, the music took off.
It took flight.
The audience gasped
when they heard the difference.
Then I got a letter from this gentleman.
He said, "I was so moved.
I went back and I transformed
my entire company
into a one-buttock company."
(Laughter)
Now, the other thing I wanted
to do is to tell you about you.
There are 1,600 people, I believe.
My estimation is that probably 45 of you
are absolutely passionate
about classical music.
You adore classical music.
Your FM is always on that classical dial.
You have CDs in your car,
and you go to the symphony,
your children are playing instruments.
You can't imagine your life
without classical music.
That's the first group, quite small.
Then there's another bigger group.
The people who don't mind classical music.
(Laughter)
You know, you've come home
from a long day,
and you take a glass of wine,
and you put your feet up.
A little Vivaldi in the background
doesn't do any harm.
That's the second group.
Now comes the third group:
people who never listen
to classical music.
It's just simply not part of your life.
You might hear it like second-hand
smoke at the airport ...
(Laughter)
-- and maybe a little bit
of a march from "Aida"
when you come into the hall.
But otherwise, you never hear it.
That's probably the largest group.
And then there's a very small group.
These are the people
who think they're tone-deaf.
Amazing number of people think
they're tone-deaf.
Actually, I hear a lot,
"My husband is tone-deaf."
(Laughter)
Actually, you cannot be tone-deaf.
Nobody is tone-deaf.
If you were tone-deaf,
you couldn't change the gears
on your car, in a stick shift car.
You couldn't tell the difference between
somebody from Texas
and somebody from Rome.
And the telephone. The telephone.
If your mother calls
on the miserable telephone,
she calls and says, "Hello,"
you not only know who it is,
you know what mood she's in.
You have a fantastic ear.
Everybody has a fantastic ear.
So nobody is tone-deaf.
But I tell you what.
It doesn't work for me
to go on with this thing,
with such a wide gulf
between those who understand,
love and are passionate
about classical music,
and those who have
no relationship to it at all.
The tone-deaf people,
they're no longer here.
But even between those three categories,
it's too wide a gulf.
So I'm not going to go on
until every single person in this room,
downstairs and in Aspen,
and everybody else looking,
will come to love
and understand classical music.
So that's what we're going to do.
Now, you notice that there is not
the slightest doubt in my mind
that this is going to work,
if you look at my face, right?
It's one of the characteristics
of a leader that he not doubt
for one moment the capacity
of the people he's leading
to realize whatever he's dreaming.
Imagine if Martin Luther King
had said, "I have a dream.
Of course, I'm not sure
they'll be up to it."
(Laughter)
All right. So I'm going
to take a piece of Chopin.
This is a beautiful prelude by Chopin.
Some of you will know it.
(Music)
Do you know what I think
probably happened here?
When I started, you thought,
"How beautiful that sounds."
(Music)
"I don't think we should
go to the same place
for our summer holidays next year."
(Laughter)
It's funny, isn't it?
It's funny how those thoughts
kind of waft into your head.
And of course --
(Applause)
Of course, if the piece is long
and you've had a long day,
you might actually drift off.
Then your companion
will dig you in the ribs
and say, "Wake up! It's culture!"
And then you feel even worse.
(Laughter)
But has it ever occurred to you
that the reason you feel sleepy
in classical music is not
because of you, but because of us?
Did anybody think while I was playing,
"Why is he using so many impulses?"
If I'd done this with my head you
certainly would have thought it.
(Music)
(Music ends)
And for the rest of your life,
every time you hear classical music,
you'll always be able to know
if you hear those impulses.
So let's see what's really going on here.
We have a B. This is a B.
The next note is a C.
And the job of the C is to make the B sad.
And it does, doesn't it?
(Laughter)
Composers know that.
If they want sad music,
they just play those two notes.
(Music)
But basically, it's just a B,
with four sads.
(Laughter)
Now, it goes down to A.
Now to G.
And then to F.
So we have B, A, G, F.
And if we have B, A, G, F,
what do we expect next?
(Music)
That might have been a fluke.
Let's try it again.
(Music)
Oh, the TED choir.
(Laughter)
And you notice nobody is tone-deaf, right?
Nobody is.
You know, every village in Bangladesh
and every hamlet in China
-- everybody knows:
da, da, da, da -- da.
Everybody knows, who's expecting that E.
Chopin didn't want to reach the E there,
because what will have happened?
It will be over, like Hamlet.
Do you remember?
Act One, scene three,
he finds out his uncle killed his father.
He keeps on going up
to his uncle and almost killing him.
And then he backs away,
he goes up to him again, almost kills him.
The critics sitting in the back row there,
they have to have an opinion,
so they say, "Hamlet is a procrastinator."
Or they say, "Hamlet has
an Oedipus complex."
No, otherwise the play
would be over, stupid.
(Laughter)
That's why Shakespeare puts
all that stuff in Hamlet --
Ophelia going mad,
the play within the play,
and Yorick's skull, and the gravediggers.
That's in order to delay --
until Act Five, he can kill him.
It's the same with the Chopin.
He's just about to reach the E,
and he says, "Oops, better
go back up and do it again."
So he does it again.
Now, he gets excited.
(Music)
That's excitement, don't worry about it.
Now, he gets to F-sharp,
and finally he goes down to E,
but it's the wrong chord --
because the chord
he's looking for is this one,
and instead he does ...
Now, we call that a deceptive cadence,
because it deceives us.
I tell my students,
"If you have a deceptive cadence,
raise your eyebrows,
and everybody will know."
(Laughter)
(Applause)
Right.
He gets to E, but it's the wrong chord.
Now, he tries E again.
That chord doesn't work.
Now, he tries the E again.
That chord doesn't work.
Now, he tries E again,
and that doesn't work.
And then finally ...
There was a gentleman
in the front row who went, "Mmm."
(Laughter)
It's the same gesture
he makes when he comes home
after a long day, turns off
the key in his car and says,
"Aah, I'm home."
Because we all know where home is.
So this is a piece which goes
from away to home.
I'm going to play it all the way through
and you're going to follow.
B, C, B, C, B, C, B --
down to A, down to G, down to F.
Almost goes to E, but otherwise
the play would be over.
He goes back up to B,
he gets very excited.
Goes to F-sharp. Goes to E.
It's the wrong chord.
It's the wrong chord.
And finally goes to E, and it's home.
And what you're going to see
is one-buttock playing.
(Laughter)
Because for me, to join the B to the E,
I have to stop thinking
about every single note along the way,
and start thinking about the long,
long line from B to E.
You know, we were just in South Africa,
and you can't go to South Africa
without thinking of Mandela
in jail for 27 years.
What was he thinking about? Lunch?
No, he was thinking
about the vision for South Africa
and for human beings.
This is about vision.
This is about the long line.
Like the bird who flies over the field
and doesn't care about the fences
underneath, all right?
So now, you're going to follow
the line all the way from B to E.
And I've one last request before I play
this piece all the way through.
Would you think of somebody who you adore,
who's no longer there?
A beloved grandmother, a lover --
somebody in your life
who you love with all your heart,
but that person is no longer with you.
Bring that person into your mind,
and at the same time,
follow the line all the way from B to E,
and you'll hear everything
that Chopin had to say.
(Music)
(Music ends)
(Applause)
Now, you may be wondering --
(Applause)
(Applause ends)
You may be wondering why I'm clapping.
Well, I did this at a school in Boston
with about 70 seventh
graders, 12-year-olds.
I did exactly what I did with you,
and I explained the whole thing.
At the end, they went crazy, clapping.
I was clapping. They were clapping.
Finally, I said, "Why am I clapping?"
And one of them said,
"Because we were listening."
(Laughter)
Think of it. 1,600 people, busy people,
involved in all sorts of different things,
listening, understanding and being moved
by a piece by Chopin.
Now, that is something.
Am I sure that every single
person followed that,
understood it, was moved by it?
Of course, I can't be sure.
But I'll tell you what happened
to me in Ireland
during the Troubles, 10 years ago,
and I was working with some Catholic
and Protestant kids
on conflict resolution.
And I did this with them --
a risky thing to do,
because they were street kids.
And one of them came to me
the next morning
and he said,
"You know, I've never listened
to classical music in my life,
but when you played
that shopping piece ..."
(Laughter)
He said, "My brother was shot last year
and I didn't cry for him.
But last night,
when you played that piece,
he was the one I was thinking about.
And I felt the tears
streaming down my face.
And it felt really
good to cry for my brother."
So I made up my mind at that moment
that classical music is for everybody.
Everybody.
Now, how would you walk --
my profession, the music profession
doesn't see it that way.
They say three percent of the population
likes classical music.
If only we could move it to four percent,
our problems would be over.
(Laughter)
How would you walk?
How would you talk? How would you be?
If you thought, "Three percent
of the population likes classical music,
if only we could move it to four percent."
How would you walk or talk?
How would you be?
If you thought, "Everybody
loves classical music --
they just haven't found out about it yet."
See, these are totally different worlds.
Now, I had an amazing experience.
I was 45 years old,
I'd been conducting for 20 years,
and I suddenly had a realization.
The conductor of an orchestra
doesn't make a sound.
My picture appears
on the front of the CD --
(Laughter)
But the conductor doesn't make a sound.
He depends, for his power,
on his ability to make
other people powerful.
And that changed everything for me.
It was totally life-changing.
People in my orchestra said,
"Ben, what happened?"
That's what happened.
I realized my job was to awaken
possibility in other people.
And of course, I wanted to know
whether I was doing that.
How do you find out?
You look at their eyes.
If their eyes are shining,
you know you're doing it.
You could light up a village
with this guy's eyes.
(Laughter)
Right. So if the eyes are shining,
you know you're doing it.
If the eyes are not shining,
you get to ask a question.
And this is the question:
who am I being
that my players' eyes are not shining?
We can do that with our children, too.
Who am I being,
that my children's eyes are not shining?
That's a totally different world.
Now, we're all about to end
this magical, on-the-mountain week,
we're going back into the world.
And I say, it's appropriate
for us to ask the question,
who are we being as we go back
out into the world?
And you know, I have
a definition of success.
For me, it's very simple.
It's not about wealth and fame and power.
It's about how many shining eyes
I have around me.
So now, I have one last thought,
which is that it really makes
a difference what we say --
the words that come out of our mouth.
I learned this from a woman
who survived Auschwitz,
one of the rare survivors.
She went to Auschwitz
when she was 15 years old.
And ...
And her brother was eight,
and the parents were lost.
And she told me this, she said,
"We were in the train going to Auschwitz,
and I looked down and saw
my brother's shoes were missing.
I said, 'Why are you so stupid,
can't you keep your things together
for goodness' sake?'"
The way an elder sister might speak
to a younger brother.
Unfortunately, it was the last
thing she ever said to him,
because she never saw him again.
He did not survive.
And so when she came out
of Auschwitz, she made a vow.
She told me this.
She said, "I walked out
of Auschwitz into life
and I made a vow.
And the vow was,
"I will never say anything that couldn't
stand as the last thing I ever say."
Now, can we do that? No.
And we'll make ourselves wrong
and others wrong.
But it is a possibility to live into.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Shining eyes.
(Applause)
Shining eyes.
(Applause)
Thank you, thank you.
Contagious is a good word.
Even in the times of H1N1, I like the word.
Laughter is contagious. Passion is contagious.
Inspiration is contagious.
We've heard some remarkable stories from some remarkable speakers.
But for me, what was contagious about all of them
was that they were infected by something I call the
"I Can" bug.
So, the question is, why only them?
In a country of a billion people and some,
why so few?
Is it luck? Is it chance?
Can we all not systematically and consciously
get infected?
So, in the next eight minutes I would like to share with you my story.
I got infected when I was 17,
when, as a student of the design college,
I encountered adults who actually believed in my ideas,
challenged me and had lots of cups of chai with me.
And I was struck by just how wonderful it felt,
and how contagious that feeling was.
I also realized I should have got infected when I was seven.
So, when I started Riverside school 10 years ago it became a lab,
a lab to prototype and refine a design process
that could consciously infect the mind with the "I Can" bug.
And I uncovered
that if learning is embedded in real-world context,
that if you blur the boundaries between school and life,
then children go through a journey of "aware,"
where they can see the change,
"enable," be changed,
and then "empower," lead the change.
And that directly increased student wellbeing.
Children became more competent,
and less helpless.
But this was all common sense.
So, I'd like to show you a little glimpse of what
common practice looks like at Riverside.
A little background: when my grade five was learning about child rights,
they were made to roll incense sticks,
agarbattis, for eight hours
to experience what it means to be a child laborer.
It transformed them. What you will see is their journey,
and then their utter conviction
that they could go out and change the world.
(Music)
That's them rolling.
And in two hours, after their backs were broke,
they were changed.
And once that happened,
they were out in the city convincing everybody
that child labor just had to be abolished.
And look at Ragav, that moment when his face changes
because he's been able to understand that he
has shifted that man's mindset.
And that can't happen in a classroom.
So, when Ragav experienced that
he went from "teacher told me,"
to "I am doing it." And that's the "I Can" mindshift.
And it is a process that can be energized and nurtured.
But we had parents who said,
"Okay, making our children good human beings is all very well,
but what about math and science and English?
Show us the grades."
And we did. The data was conclusive.
When children are empowered,
not only do they do good,
they do well, in fact very well,
as you can see in this national benchmarking assessment
taken by over 2,000 schools in India,
Riverside children were outperforming the top 10 schools in India
in math, English and science.
So, it worked. It was now time to take it outside Riverside.
So, on August 15th, Independence Day, 2007,
the children of Riverside set out to infect Ahmedabad.
Now it was not about Riverside school.
It was about all children. So, we were shameless.
We walked into the offices of the municipal corporation, the police,
the press, businesses,
and basically said, "When are you going to wake up
and recognize the potential that resides in every child?
When will you include the child in the city?
Basically, open your hearts and your minds to the child."
So, how did the city respond?
Since 2007 every other month
the city closes down the busiest streets for traffic
and converts it into a playground for children and childhood.
Here was a city telling its child, "You can."
A glimpse of infection in Ahmedabad.
Video: [Unclear]
So, the busiest streets closed down.
We have the traffic police and municipal corporation helping us.
It gets taken over by children.
They are skating. They are doing street plays.
They are playing, all free, for all children.
(Music)
Atul Karwal: aProCh is an organization which has been doing things for kids earlier.
And we plan to extend this to other parts of the city.
(Music)
Kiran Bir Sethi: And the city will give free time.
And Ahmedabad got the first child-friendly zebra crossing in the world.
Geet Sethi: When a city gives to the children,
in the future the children will give back to the city.
(Music)
KBS: And because of that,
Ahmedabad is known as India's first child-friendly city.
So, you're getting the pattern. First 200 children at Riverside.
Then 30,000 children in Ahmedabad, and growing.
It was time now to infect India.
So, on August 15th,
again, Independence Day, 2009,
empowered with the same process,
we empowered 100,000 children to say, "I can."
How? We designed a simple toolkit,
converted it into eight languages,
and reached 32,000 schools.
We basically gave children a very simple challenge.
We said, take one idea,
anything that bothers you,
choose one week,
and change a billion lives.
And they did. Stories of change
poured in from all over India,
from Nagaland in the east,
to Jhunjhunu in the west,
from Sikkim in the north, to Krishnagiri in the south.
Children were designing solutions for a diverse range of problems.
Right from loneliness to filling potholes in the street
to alcoholism,
and 32 children who stopped 16 child marriages
in Rajasthan.
I mean, it was incredible.
Basically again reaffirming that when adults believe in children
and say, "You can," then they will.
Infection in India.
This is in Rajasthan, a rural village.
Child: Our parents are illiterate and we want to teach them how to read and write.
KBS: First time, a rally and a street play in a rural school --
unheard of -- to tell their parents why literacy is important.
Look at what their parents says.
Man: This program is wonderful.
We feel so nice that our children can teach us how to read and write.
Woman: I am so happy that my students did this campaign.
In the future, I will never doubt my students' abilities.
See? They have done it.
KBS: An inner city school in Hyderabad.
Girl: 581. This house is 581 ...
We have to start collecting from 555.
KBS: Girls and boys in Hyderabad, going out,
pretty difficult, but they did it.
Woman: Even though they are so young, they have done such good work.
First they have cleaned the society, then it will be Hyderabad, and soon India.
Woman: It was a revelation for me. It doesn't strike me
that they had so much inside them.
Girl: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
For our auction we have some wonderful paintings for you,
for a very good cause,
the money you give us will be used to buy hearing aids.
Are you ready, ladies and gentlemen? Audience: Yes!
Girl: Are you ready? Audience: Yes!
Girl: Are you ready? Audience: Yes!
KBS: So, the charter of compassion starts right here.
Street plays, auctions, petitions.
I mean, they were changing lives.
It was incredible.
So, how can we still stay immune?
How can we stay immune to that passion, that energy, that excitement?
I know it's obvious,
but I have to end with the most powerful symbol of change, Gandhiji.
70 years ago, it took one man
to infect an entire nation
with the power of "We can."
So, today who is it going to take
to spread the infection from 100,000 children
to the 200 million children in India?
Last I heard, the preamble still said, "We, the people of India," right?
So, if not us, then who?
If not now, then when?
Like I said, contagious is a good word.
Thank you.
(Applause)
I remember my aunt
brushing my hair when I was a child.
I felt this tingling in my stomach,
this swelling in my belly.
All her attention on me,
just me.
My beautiful Aunt Bea,
stroking my hair
with a fine-bristled brush.
Do you have a memory like that
that you can feel in your body right now?
Before language,
we're all sensation.
As children, that's how we learn
to differentiate ourselves
in the world -- through touch.
Everything goes in the mouth,
the hands, on the skin.
Sensation --
it is the way that we first
experience love.
It's the basis of human connection.
We want our children to grow up
to have healthy intimate relationships.
So as parents,
one of the things that we do
is we teach our children about sex.
We have books to help us,
we have sex ed at school for the basics.
There's porn to fill in the gaps --
and it will fill in the gaps.
(Laughter)
We teach our children "the talk"
about biology and mechanics,
about pregnancy and safe sex,
and that's what our kids grow up thinking
that sex is pretty much all about.
But we can do better than that.
We can teach our sons and daughters
about pleasure and desire,
about consent and boundaries,
about what it feels like
to be present in their body
and to know when they're not.
And we do that in the ways
that we model touch, play,
make eye contact --
all the ways that we engage their senses.
We can teach our children
not just about sex,
but about sensuality.
This is the kind of talk
that I needed as a girl.
I was extremely sensitive,
but by the time I was an adolescent,
I had numbed out.
The shame of boys mocking my changing body
and then girls exiling me for,
ironically, my interest in boys,
it was so much.
I didn't have any language
for what I was experiencing;
I didn't know it was going to pass.
So I did the best thing
I could at the time
and I checked out.
And you can't isolate
just the difficult feelings,
so I lost access to the joy,
the pleasure, the play,
and I spent decades like that,
with this his low-grade depression,
thinking that this is
what it meant to be a grown-up.
For the past year,
I've been interviewing men and women
about their relationship to sex
and I've heard my story again and again.
Girls who were told
they were too sensitive, too much.
Boys who were taught to man up --
"don't be so emotional."
I learned I was not alone in checking out.
It was my daughter who reminded me
of how much I used to feel.
We were at the beach.
It was this rare day.
I turned off my cell phone,
put in the calendar,
"Day at the beach with the girls."
I laid our towels down
just out of reach of the surf
and fell asleep.
And when I woke up,
I saw my daughter
drizzling sand on her arm like this,
and I could feel that light tickle
of sand on her skin
and I remembered my aunt brushing my hair.
So I curled up next to her
and I drizzled sand on her other arm
and then her legs.
And then I said,
"Hey, you want me to bury you?"
And her eyes got really big
and she was like, "Yeah!"
So we dug a hole
and I covered her in sand and shells
and drew this little mermaid tail.
And then I took her home
and lathered her up in the shower
and massaged her scalp
and I dried her off in a towel.
And I thought,
"Ah. How many times had I done that --
bathed her and dried her off --
but had I ever stopped and paid attention
to the sensations
that I was creating for her?"
I'd been treating her
like she was on some assembly line
of children needing to be fed
and put to bed.
And I realized
that when I dry my daughter off
in a towel tenderly the way a lover would,
I'm teaching her
to expect that kind of touch.
I'm teaching her in that moment
about intimacy.
About how to love her body
and respect her body.
I realized there are parts of the talk
that can't be conveyed in words.
In her book, "Girls and Sex,"
writer Peggy Orenstein finds
that young women are focusing
on their partner's pleasure,
not their own.
This is something I'm going to talk about
with my girls when they're older,
but for now, I look for ways to help them
identify what gives them pleasure
and to practice articulating that.
"Rub my back," my daughter says
when I tuck her in.
And I say, "OK, how do you want me
to rub your back?"
"I don't know," she says.
So I pause, waiting for her directions.
Finally she says,
"OK, up and to the right,
like you're tickling me."
I run my fingertips up her spine.
"What else?" I ask.
"Over to the left, a little harder now."
We need to teach our children
how to articulate their sensations
so they're familiar with them.
I look for ways to play games
with my girls at home to do this.
I scratch my fingernails
on my daughter's arm and say,
"Give me one word to describe this."
"Violent," she says.
I embrace her, hold her tight.
"Protected," she tells me.
I find opportunities
to tell them how I'm feeling,
what I'm experiencing,
so we have common language.
Like right now,
this tingling in my scalp down my spine
means I'm nervous and I'm excited.
You are likely experiencing sensations
in response to me.
The language I'm using,
the ideas I'm sharing.
And our tendency
is to judge these reactions
and sort them into a hierarchy:
better or worse,
and then seek or avoid them.
And that's because we live
in this binary culture
and we're taught from a very young age
to sort the world into good and bad.
"Did you like that book?"
"Did you have a good day?"
How about, "What did you
notice about that story?"
"Tell me a moment about your day.
What did you learn?"
Let's teach our children to stay open
and curious about their experiences,
like a traveler in a foreign land.
And that way they can stay with sensation
without checking out --
even the heightened
and challenging ones --
the way I did,
the way so many of us have.
This sense education,
this is education I want for my daughters.
Sense education is what I needed as girl.
It's what I hope for all of our children.
This awareness of sensation,
it's where we began as children.
It's what we can learn from our children
and it's what we can
in turn remind our children
as they come of age.
Thank you.
(Applause)
For me they normally happen,
these career crises,
often, actually, on a Sunday evening,
just as the sun is starting to set,
and the gap between my hopes for myself
and the reality of my life
starts to diverge so painfully
that I normally end up
weeping into a pillow.
I'm mentioning all this --
I'm mentioning all this because I think
this is not merely a personal problem;
you may think I'm wrong in this,
but I think we live in an age
when our lives are regularly punctuated
by career crises, by moments
when what we thought we knew --
about our lives, about our careers --
comes into contact
with a threatening sort of reality.
It's perhaps easier now than ever before
to make a good living.
It's perhaps harder than ever before
to stay calm, to be free
of career anxiety.
I want to look now, if I may,
at some of the reasons
why we might be feeling
anxiety about our careers.
Why we might be victims
of these career crises,
as we're weeping softly into our pillows.
One of the reasons
why we might be suffering
is that we are surrounded by snobs.
In a way, I've got some bad news,
particularly to anybody
who's come to Oxford from abroad.
There's a real problem with snobbery,
because sometimes people
from outside the U.K.
imagine that snobbery
is a distinctively U.K. phenomenon,
fixated on country houses and titles.
The bad news is that's not true.
Snobbery is a global phenomenon;
we are a global organization,
this is a global phenomenon.
What is a snob?
A snob is anybody who takes
a small part of you,
and uses that to come
to a complete vision of who you are.
That is snobbery.
The dominant kind of snobbery
that exists nowadays is job snobbery.
You encounter it within minutes
at a party, when you get asked
that famous iconic question
of the early 21st century,
"What do you do?"
According to how you answer that question,
people are either incredibly
delighted to see you,
or look at their watch
and make their excuses.
(Laughter)
Now, the opposite of a snob
is your mother.
(Laughter)
Not necessarily your mother,
or indeed mine,
but, as it were, the ideal mother,
somebody who doesn't care
about your achievements.
Unfortunately, most people
are not our mothers.
Most people make a strict correlation
between how much time,
and if you like, love --
not romantic love,
though that may be something --
but love in general, respect --
they are willing to accord us,
that will be strictly defined
by our position in the social hierarchy.
And that's a lot of the reason
why we care so much about our careers
and indeed start caring
so much about material goods.
You know, we're often told
that we live in very materialistic times,
that we're all greedy people.
I don't think we are
particularly materialistic.
I think we live in a society which has
simply pegged certain emotional rewards
to the acquisition of material goods.
It's not the material goods we want;
it's the rewards we want.
It's a new way of looking at luxury goods.
The next time you see somebody
driving a Ferrari, don't think,
"This is somebody who's greedy."
Think, "This is somebody who is incredibly
vulnerable and in need of love."
(Laughter)
Feel sympathy, rather than contempt.
There are other reasons --
(Laughter)
There are other reasons why it's perhaps
harder now to feel calm than ever before.
One of these, and it's paradoxical,
because it's linked to something
that's rather nice,
is the hope we all have for our careers.
Never before have
expectations been so high
about what human beings can
achieve with their lifespan.
We're told, from many sources,
that anyone can achieve anything.
We've done away with the caste system,
we are now in a system where anyone
can rise to any position they please.
And it's a beautiful idea.
Along with that is a kind
of spirit of equality;
we're all basically equal.
There are no strictly defined hierarchies.
There is one really big problem with this,
and that problem is envy.
Envy, it's a real taboo to mention envy,
but if there's one dominant emotion
in modern society, that is envy.
And it's linked to the spirit of equality.
Let me explain.
I think it would be very unusual
for anyone here, or anyone watching,
to be envious of the Queen of England.
Even though she is much richer
than any of you are,
and she's got a very large house,
the reason why we don't envy her
is because she's too weird.
(Laughter)
She's simply too strange.
We can't relate to her,
she speaks in a funny way,
she comes from an odd place.
So we can't relate to her,
and when you can't relate
to somebody, you don't envy them.
The closer two people are --
in age, in background,
in the process of identification --
the more there's a danger of envy,
which is incidentally why none of you
should ever go to a school reunion,
because there is no stronger reference
point than people one was at school with.
The problem of modern society is
it turns the whole world into a school.
Everybody's wearing jeans,
everybody's the same.
And yet, they're not.
So there's a spirit of equality
combined with deep inequality,
which can make for
a very stressful situation.
It's probably as unlikely
that you would nowadays
become as rich and famous as Bill Gates,
as it was unlikely in the 17th century
that you would accede to the ranks
of the French aristocracy.
But the point is,
it doesn't feel that way.
It's made to feel, by magazines
and other media outlets,
that if you've got energy, a few bright
ideas about technology, a garage --
you, too, could start a major thing.
(Laughter)
The consequences of this problem
make themselves felt in bookshops.
When you go to a large bookshop
and look at the self-help sections,
as I sometimes do --
if you analyze self-help books
produced in the world today,
there are basically two kinds.
The first kind tells you, "You can do it!
You can make it! Anything's possible!"
The other kind tells you how to cope with
what we politely call "low self-esteem,"
or impolitely call,
"feeling very bad about yourself."
There's a real correlation
between a society that tells people
that they can do anything,
and the existence of low self-esteem.
So that's another way in which something
quite positive can have a nasty kickback.
There is another reason why
we might be feeling more anxious --
about our careers, about our status
in the world today, than ever before.
And it's, again, linked to something nice.
And that nice thing is called meritocracy.
Everybody, all politicians
on Left and Right,
agree that meritocracy is a great thing,
and we should all be trying to make
our societies really, really meritocratic.
In other words --
what is a meritocratic society?
A meritocratic society is one in which,
if you've got talent and energy and skill,
you will get to the top,
nothing should hold you back.
It's a beautiful idea.
The problem is, if you
really believe in a society
where those who merit to get
to the top, get to the top,
you'll also, by implication,
and in a far more nasty way,
believe in a society where those
who deserve to get to the bottom
also get to the bottom and stay there.
In other words, your position in life
comes to seem not accidental,
but merited and deserved.
And that makes failure
seem much more crushing.
You know, in the Middle Ages, in England,
when you met a very poor person,
that person would be described
as an "unfortunate" --
literally, somebody who had not
been blessed by fortune, an unfortunate.
Nowadays, particularly
in the United States,
if you meet someone
at the bottom of society,
they may unkindly be
described as a "loser."
There's a real difference
between an unfortunate and a loser,
and that shows 400 years
of evolution in society
and our belief in who
is responsible for our lives.
It's no longer the gods, it's us.
We're in the driving seat.
That's exhilarating if you're doing well,
and very crushing if you're not.
It leads, in the worst cases --
in the analysis of a sociologist
like Emil Durkheim --
it leads to increased rates of suicide.
There are more suicides
in developed, individualistic countries
than in any other part of the world.
And some of the reason for that
is that people take what happens to them
extremely personally --
they own their success,
but they also own their failure.
Is there any relief
from some of these pressures
that I've been outlining?
I think there is.
I just want to turn to a few of them.
Let's take meritocracy.
This idea that everybody deserves
to get where they get to,
I think it's a crazy idea,
completely crazy.
I will support any politician
of Left and Right,
with any halfway-decent meritocratic idea;
I am a meritocrat in that sense.
But I think it's insane to believe
that we will ever make a society
that is genuinely meritocratic;
it's an impossible dream.
The idea that we will make a society
where literally everybody is graded,
the good at the top, bad at the bottom,
exactly done as it
should be, is impossible.
There are simply too many random factors:
accidents, accidents of birth,
accidents of things dropping
on people's heads, illnesses, etc.
We will never get to grade them,
never get to grade people as they should.
I'm drawn to a lovely quote
by St. Augustine in "The City of God,"
where he says, "It's a sin
to judge any man by his post."
In modern English that would mean
it's a sin to come to any view
of who you should talk to,
dependent on their business card.
It's not the post that should count.
According to St. Augustine, only God
can really put everybody in their place;
he's going to do that
on the Day of Judgment,
with angels and trumpets,
and the skies will open.
Insane idea, if you're
a secularist person, like me.
But something very valuable
in that idea, nevertheless.
In other words, hold your horses
when you're coming to judge people.
You don't necessarily know
what someone's true value is.
That is an unknown part of them,
and we shouldn't behave
as though it is known.
There is another source of solace
and comfort for all this.
When we think about failing in life,
when we think about failure,
one of the reasons why we fear failing
is not just a loss of income,
a loss of status.
What we fear is the judgment
and ridicule of others.
And it exists.
The number one organ of ridicule,
nowadays, is the newspaper.
If you open the newspaper
any day of the week,
it's full of people
who've messed up their lives.
They've slept with the wrong person,
taken the wrong substance,
passed the wrong piece of legislation --
whatever it is, and then
are fit for ridicule.
In other words, they have failed.
And they are described as "losers."
Now, is there any alternative to this?
I think the Western tradition shows us one
glorious alternative, which is tragedy.
Tragic art, as it developed
in the theaters of ancient Greece,
in the fifth century B.C.,
was essentially an art form
devoted to tracing how people fail,
and also according them
a level of sympathy,
which ordinary life would not
necessarily accord them.
A few years ago,
I was thinking about this,
and I went to "The Sunday Sport,"
a tabloid newspaper I don't
recommend you start reading
if you're not familiar with it already.
(Laughter)
And I went to talk to them
about certain of the great
tragedies of Western art.
I wanted to see how they would seize
the bare bones of certain stories,
if they came in as a news item
at the news desk on a Saturday afternoon.
I mentioned Othello; they'd not
heard of it but were fascinated.
(Laughter)
I asked them to write
a headline for the story.
They came up with "Love-Crazed
Immigrant Kills Senator's Daughter."
Splashed across the headline.
I gave them the plotline of Madame Bovary.
Again, a book they were
enchanted to discover.
And they wrote "Shopaholic Adulteress
Swallows Arsenic After Credit Fraud."
(Laughter)
And then my favorite --
they really do have a kind of genius
of their own, these guys --
my favorite is Sophocles'
Oedipus the King:
"Sex With Mum Was Blinding."
(Laughter)
(Applause)
In a way, if you like, at one end
of the spectrum of sympathy,
you've got the tabloid newspaper.
At the other end of the spectrum,
you've got tragedy and tragic art.
And I suppose I'm arguing
that we should learn a little bit
about what's happening in tragic art.
It would be insane to call Hamlet a loser.
He is not a loser, though he has lost.
And I think that is the message
of tragedy to us,
and why it's so very,
very important, I think.
The other thing about modern society
and why it causes this anxiety,
is that we have nothing at its center
that is non-human.
We are the first society
to be living in a world
where we don't worship
anything other than ourselves.
We think very highly of ourselves,
and so we should;
we've put people on the Moon,
done all sorts of extraordinary things.
And so we tend to worship ourselves.
Our heroes are human heroes.
That's a very new situation.
Most other societies have had,
right at their center,
the worship of something transcendent:
a god, a spirit, a natural force,
the universe, whatever it is --
something else that is being worshiped.
We've slightly lost
the habit of doing that,
which is, I think, why we're
particularly drawn to nature.
Not for the sake of our health,
though it's often presented that way,
but because it's an escape
from the human anthill.
It's an escape from our own competition,
and our own dramas.
And that's why we enjoy looking
at glaciers and oceans,
and contemplating the Earth
from outside its perimeters, etc.
We like to feel in contact
with something that is non-human,
and that is so deeply important to us.
What I think I've been talking
about really is success and failure.
And one of the interesting
things about success
is that we think we know what it means.
If I said that there's somebody
behind the screen who's very successful,
certain ideas would
immediately come to mind.
You'd think that person
might have made a lot of money,
achieved renown in some field.
My own theory of success --
I'm somebody who's
very interested in success,
I really want to be successful,
always thinking,
how can I be more successful?
But as I get older, I'm also very nuanced
about what that word "success" might mean.
Here's an insight
that I've had about success:
You can't be successful at everything.
We hear a lot of talk
about work-life balance.
Nonsense.
You can't have it all. You can't.
So any vision of success
has to admit what it's losing out on,
where the element of loss is.
And I think any wise life will accept,
as I say, that there is going to be
an element where we're not succeeding.
And the thing about a successful life
is that a lot of the time,
our ideas of what it would mean
to live successfully are not our own.
They're sucked in from other people;
chiefly, if you're a man, your father,
and if you're a woman, your mother.
Psychoanalysis has been drumming home
this message for about 80 years.
No one's quite listening hard enough,
but I very much believe it's true.
And we also suck in messages
from everything from the television,
to advertising, to marketing, etc.
These are hugely powerful forces
that define what we want
and how we view ourselves.
When we're told that banking
is a very respectable profession,
a lot of us want to go into banking.
When banking is no longer so respectable,
we lose interest in banking.
We are highly open to suggestion.
So what I want to argue for
is not that we should give up
on our ideas of success,
but we should make sure
that they are our own.
We should focus in on our ideas,
and make sure that we own them;
that we are truly the authors
of our own ambitions.
Because it's bad enough
not getting what you want,
but it's even worse to have
an idea of what it is you want,
and find out, at the end of the journey,
that it isn't, in fact,
what you wanted all along.
So, I'm going to end it there.
But what I really want to stress is:
by all means, success, yes.
But let's accept the strangeness
of some of our ideas.
Let's probe away
at our notions of success.
Let's make sure our ideas of success
are truly our own.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
Chris Anderson: That was fascinating.
But how do you reconcile this idea
of it being bad to think
of someone as a "loser,"
with the idea that a lot of people like,
of seizing control of your life,
and that a society that encourages that,
perhaps has to have
some winners and losers?
Alain De Botton: Yes, I think
it's merely the randomness
of the winning and losing process
that I want to stress,
because the emphasis nowadays is so much
on the justice of everything,
and politicians always talk about justice.
Now I'm a firm believer in justice,
I just think that it's impossible.
So we should do everything
we can to pursue it,
but we should always remember
that whoever is facing us,
whatever has happened in their lives,
there will be a strong
element of the haphazard.
That's what I'm trying to leave room for;
otherwise, it can get
quite claustrophobic.
CA: I mean, do you believe
that you can combine
your kind of kinder,
gentler philosophy of work
with a successful economy?
Or do you think that you can't,
but it doesn't matter that much that we're
putting too much emphasis on that?
AB: The nightmare thought
is that frightening people
is the best way to get work out of them,
and that somehow
the crueler the environment,
the more people will rise
to the challenge.
You want to think, who would you like
as your ideal dad?
And your ideal dad is somebody
who is tough but gentle.
And it's a very hard line to make.
We need fathers, as it were,
the exemplary father figures in society,
avoiding the two extremes,
which is the authoritarian
disciplinarian on the one hand,
and on the other,
the lax, no-rules option.
CA: Alain De Botton.
AB: Thank you very much.
(Applause)
Consider the following statement:
human beings only use 10 percent
of their brain capacity.
Well, as a neuroscientist, I can tell you
that while Morgan Freeman
delivered this line
with the gravitas
that makes him a great actor,
this statement is entirely false.
(Laughter)
The truth is, human beings use 100 percent
of their brain capacity.
The brain is a highly efficient,
energy-demanding organ
that gets fully utilized
and even though it is
at full capacity being used,
it suffers from a problem
of information overload.
There's far too much in the environment
than it can fully process.
So to solve this problem of overload,
evolution devised a solution,
which is the brain's attention system.
Attention allows us
to notice, select and direct
the brain's computational resources
to a subset of all that's available.
We can think of attention
as the leader of the brain.
Wherever attention goes,
the rest of the brain follows.
In some sense, it's your brain's boss.
And over the last 15 years,
I've been studying
the human brain's attention system.
In all of our studies,
I've been very interested in one question.
If it is indeed the case
that our attention is the brain's boss,
is it a good boss?
Does it actually guide us well?
And to dig in on this big question,
I wanted to know three things.
First, how does attention
control our perception?
Second, why does it fail us,
often leaving us feeling
foggy and distracted?
And third, can we do anything
about this fogginess,
can we train our brain
to pay better attention?
To have more strong and stable attention
in the work that we do in our lives.
So I wanted to give you a brief glimpse
into how we're going to look at this.
A very poignant example
of how our attention
ends up getting utilized.
And I want to do it using the example
of somebody that I know quite well.
He ends up being part of a very large
group of people that we work with,
for whom attention
is a matter of life and death.
Think of medical professionals
or firefighters
or soldiers or marines.
This is the story of a marine captain,
Captain Jeff Davis.
And the scene that I'm going to share
with you, as you can see,
is not about his time in the battlefield.
He was actually on a bridge, in Florida.
But instead of looking
at the scenery around him,
seeing the beautiful vistas
and noticing the cool ocean breezes,
he was driving fast and contemplating
driving off that bridge.
And he would later tell me that it took
all of everything he had not to do so.
You see, he'd just returned from Iraq.
And while his body was on that bridge,
his mind, his attention,
was thousands of miles away.
He was gripped with suffering.
His mind was worried and preoccupied
and had stressful memories
and, really, dread for his future.
And I'm really glad
that he didn't take his life.
Because he, as a leader,
knew that he wasn't the only one
that was probably suffering;
many of his fellow marines
probably were, too.
And in the year 2008, he partnered with me
in the first-of-its-kind project
that actually allowed us to test and offer
something called mindfulness training
to active-duty military personnel.
But before I tell you about
what mindfulness training is,
or the results of that study,
I think it's important to understand
how attention works in the brain.
So what we do in the laboratory
is that many of our studies of attention
involve brain-wave recordings.
In these brain wave recordings,
people wear funny-looking caps
that are sort of like swimming caps,
that have electrodes embedded in them.
These electrodes pick up
the ongoing brain electrical activity.
And they do it with millisecond
temporal precision.
So we can see these small yet detectable
voltage fluctuations over time.
And doing this, we can very precisely
plot the timing of the brain's activity.
About 170 milliseconds
after we show our research participants
a face on the screen,
we see a very reliable,
detectable brain signature.
It happens right at the back of the scalp,
above the regions of the brain
that are involved in face processing.
Now, this happens so reliably
and so on cue,
as the brain's face detector,
that we've even given
this brain-wave component a name.
We call it the N170 component.
And we use this component
in many of our studies.
It allows us to see the impact
that attention may have on our perception.
I'm going to give you a sense
of the kind of experiments
that we actually do in the lab.
We would show participants
images like this one.
You should see a face and a scene
overlaid on each other.
And what we do is we ask our participants
as they're viewing a series
of these types of overlaid images,
to do something with their attention.
On some trials, we'll ask them
to pay attention to the face.
And to make sure they're doing that,
we ask them to tell us,
by pressing a button,
if the face appeared to be male or female.
On other trials,
we ask them to tell what the scene was --
was it indoor or outdoor?
And in this way,
we can manipulate attention
and confirm that the participants
were actually doing what we said.
Our hypotheses about attention
were as follows:
if attention is indeed doing its job
and affecting perception,
maybe it works like an amplifier.
And what I mean by this
is that when we direct
attention to the face,
it becomes clearer and more salient,
it's easier to see.
But when we direct it to the scene,
the face becomes barely perceptible
as we process the scene information.
So what we wanted to do
is look at this brain-wave component
of face detection, the N170,
and see if it changed at all
as a function of where our participants
were paying attention --
to the scene or the face.
And here's what we found.
We found that when they paid
attention to the face,
the N170 was larger.
And when they paid attention to the scene,
as you can see in red, it was smaller.
And that gap you see
between the blue and red lines
is pretty powerful.
What it tells us is that attention,
which is really the only
thing that changed,
since the images they viewed
were identical in both cases --
attention changes perception.
And it does so very fast.
Within 170 milliseconds
of actually seeing a face.
In our follow-up studies,
we wanted to see what would happen,
how could we perturb
or diminish this effect.
And our hunch was that if you put people
in a very stressful environment,
if you distract them with disturbing,
negative images,
images of suffering and violence --
sort of like what you might see
on the news, unfortunately --
that doing this might
actually affect their attention.
And that's indeed what we found.
If we present stressful images
while they're doing this experiment,
this gap of attention shrinks,
its power diminishes.
So in some of our other studies,
we wanted to see, OK, great --
not great, actually, bad news
that stress does this to the brain --
but if it is the case that stress
has this powerful influence on attention
through external distraction,
what if we don't need
external distraction,
what if we distract ourselves?
And to do this,
we had to basically come up
with an experiment
in which we could have people
generate their own mind-wandering.
This is having off-task thoughts
while we're engaged
in an ongoing task of some sort.
And the trick to mind-wandering
is that essentially, you bore people.
So hopefully there's not a lot
of mind-wandering happening right now.
When we bore people,
people happily generate all kinds
of internal content to occupy themselves.
So we devised what might be considered
one of the world's
most boring experiments.
All the participants saw
were a series of faces on the screen,
one after another.
They pressed the button
every time they saw the face.
That was pretty much it.
Well, one trick was that sometimes,
the face would be upside down,
and it would happen very infrequently.
On those trials they were told
just to withhold the response.
Pretty soon, we could tell that
they were successfully mind-wandering,
because they pressed the button
when that face was upside down.
Even though it's quite plain to see
that it was upside down.
So we wanted to know what happens
when people have mind-wandering.
And what we found was that,
very similar to external stress
and external distraction
in the environment,
internal distraction,
our own mind wandering,
also shrinks the gap of attention.
It diminishes attention's power.
So what do all of these studies tell us?
They tell us that attention
is very powerful
in terms of affecting our perception.
Even though it's so powerful,
it's also fragile and vulnerable.
And things like stress
and mind-wandering diminish its power.
But that's all in the context of these
very controlled laboratory settings.
What about in the real world?
What about in our actual day-to-day life?
What about now?
Where is your attention right now?
To kind of bring it back,
I'd like to make a prediction
about your attention
for the remainder of my talk.
Are you up for it?
Here's the prediction.
You will be unaware of what I'm saying
for four out of the next eight minutes.
(Laughter)
It's a challenge,
so pay attention, please.
Now, why am I saying this?
I'm surely going to assume
that you're going to remain seated
and, you know, graciously keep
your eyes on me as I speak.
But a growing body of literature suggests
that we mind-wander,
we take our mind away
from the task at hand,
about 50 percent of our waking moments.
These might be small,
little trips that we take away,
private thoughts that we have.
And when this mind-wandering happens,
it can be problematic.
Now I don't think there will be
any dire consequences
with you all sitting here today,
but imagine a military leader missing
four minutes of a military briefing,
or a judge missing
four minutes of testimony.
Or a surgeon or firefighter
missing any time.
The consequences
in those cases could be dire.
So we might ask why do we do this?
Why do we mind-wander so much?
Well, part of the answer is that our mind
is an exquisite time-traveling master.
It can actually time travel very easily.
If we think of the mind as the metaphor
of the music player, we see this.
We can rewind the mind to the past
to reflect on events
that have already happened, right?
Or we can go and fast-future, to plan
for the next thing that we want to do.
And we land in this mental
time-travel mode of the past or the future
very frequently.
And we land there often
without our awareness,
most times without our awareness,
even if we want to be paying attention.
Think of just the last time
you were trying to read a book,
got to the bottom of the page
with no idea what the words were saying.
This happens to us.
And when this happens, when we mind-wander
without an awareness that we're doing it,
there are consequences.
We make errors.
We miss critical information, sometimes.
And we have difficulty making decisions.
What's worse is when we experience stress.
When we're in a moment of overwhelm.
We don't just reflect
on the past when we rewind,
we end up being in the past
ruminating, reliving or regretting
events that have already happened.
Or under stress, we fast-forward the mind.
Not just to productively plan.
But we end up catastrophizing or worrying
about events that haven't happened yet
and frankly may never happen.
So at this point, you might be
thinking to yourself, OK,
mind-wandering's happening a lot.
Often, it happens without our awareness.
And under stress, it's even worse --
we mind-wander more powerfully
and more often.
Is there anything
we can possibly do about this?
And I'm happy to say the answer is yes.
From our work, we're learning
that the opposite of a stressed
and wandering mind is a mindful one.
Mindfulness has to do
with paying attention
to our present-moment experience
with awareness.
And without any kind of emotional
reactivity of what's happening.
It's about keeping
that button right on play
to experience the moment-to-moment
unfolding of our lives.
And mindfulness is not just a concept.
It's more like practice,
you have to embody this mindful
mode of being to have any benefits.
And a lot of the work that we're doing,
we're offering people programs
that give our participants
a suite of exercises
that they should do daily
in order to cultivate more moments
of mindfulness in their life.
And for many of the groups
that we work with, high-stress groups,
like I said -- soldiers,
medical professionals --
for them, as we know,
mind-wandering can be really dire.
So we want to make sure
we offer them very accessible,
low time constraints
to optimize the training,
so they can benefit from it.
And when we do this, what we can do
is track to see what happens,
not just in their regular lives
but in the most demanding
circumstances that they may have.
Why do we want to do this?
Well, we want to, for example, give it
to students right around finals season.
Or we want to give the training
to accountants during tax season.
Or soldiers and marines
while they're deploying.
Why is that?
Because those are the moments
in which their attention
is most likely to be vulnerable,
because of stress and mind-wandering.
And those are also the moments
in which we want their attention
to be in peak shape
so they can perform well.
So what we do in our research
is we have them take
a series of attention tests.
We track their attention at the beginning
of some kind of high-stress interval,
and then two months later,
we track them again,
and we want to see
if there's a difference.
Is there any benefit of offering them
mindfulness training?
Can we protect against
the lapses in attention
that might arise over high stress?
So here's what we find.
Over a high-stress interval,
unfortunately, the reality is
if we don't do anything at all,
attention declines,
people are worse at the end
of this high-stress interval than before.
But if we offer mindfulness training,
we can protect against this.
They stay stable, even though
just like the other groups,
they were experiencing high stress.
And perhaps even more impressive
is that if people
take our training programs
over, let's say, eight weeks,
and they fully commit
to doing the daily mindfulness exercises
that allow them to learn
how to be in the present moment,
well, they actually get better over time,
even though they're in high stress.
And this last point
is actually important to realize,
because of what it suggests to us
is that mindfulness exercises
are very much like physical exercise:
if you don't do it, you don't benefit.
But if you do engage
in mindfulness practice,
the more you do, the more you benefit.
And I want to just bring it back
to Captain Jeff Davis.
As I mentioned to you at the beginning,
his marines were involved
in the very first project
that we ever did,
offering mindfulness training.
And they showed this exact pattern,
which was very heartening.
We had offered them
the mindfulness training
right before they were deployed to Iraq.
And upon their return,
Captain Davis shared with us
what he was feeling
was the benefit of this program.
He said that unlike last time,
after this deployment,
they were much more present.
They were discerning.
They were not as reactive.
And in some cases,
they were really more compassionate
with the people they were
engaging with and each other.
He said in many ways,
he felt that the mindfulness
training program we offered
gave them a really important tool
to protect against developing
post-traumatic stress disorder
and even allowing it to turn
into post-traumatic growth.
To us, this was very compelling.
And it ended up
that Captain Davis and I --
you know, this was about
a decade ago, in 2008 --
we've kept in touch all these years.
And he himself has gone on
to continue practicing mindfulness
in a daily way.
He was promoted to major,
he actually then ended up retiring
from the Marine Corps.
He went on to get a divorce,
to get remarried,
to have a child, to get an MBA.
And through all of these challenges
and transitions and joys of his life,
he kept up with his mindfulness practice.
And as fate would have it,
just a few months ago,
Captain Davis suffered a massive
heart attack, at the age of 46.
And he ended up calling me
a few weeks ago.
And he said, "I want
to tell you something.
I know that the doctors
who worked on me, they saved my heart,
but mindfulness saved my life.
The presence of mind I had
to stop the ambulance
that ended up taking me
to the hospital," -- himself,
the clarity of mind he had to notice
when there was fear and anxiety happening
but not be gripped by it --
he said, "For me, these
were the gifts of mindfulness."
And I was so relieved
to hear that he was OK.
But really heartened to see
that he had transformed his own attention.
He went from having a really bad boss --
an attention system
that nearly drove him off a bridge --
to one that was an exquisite
leader and guide,
and saved his life.
So I want to actually end by sharing
my call to action to all of you.
And here it is.
Pay attention to your attention.
Alright?
Pay attention to your attention
and incorporate mindfulness training
as part of your daily wellness toolkit,
in order to tame your own wandering mind
and to allow your attention
to be a trusted guide in your own life.
Thank you.
(Applause)
So I just want to tell you my story.
I spend a lot of time
teaching adults how to use visual language
and doodling in the workplace.
And naturally, I encounter a lot of resistance,
because it's considered to be anti-intellectual
and counter to serious learning.
But I have a problem with that belief,
because I know that doodling has a profound impact
on the way that we can process information
and the way that we can solve problems.
So I was curious about why there was a disconnect
between the way our society perceives doodling
and the way that the reality is.
So I discovered some very interesting things.
For example, there's no such thing
as a flattering definition of a doodle.
In the 17th century, a doodle was a simpleton or a fool --
as in Yankee Doodle.
In the 18th century, it became a verb,
and it meant to swindle or ridicule or to make fun of someone.
In the 19th century, it was a corrupt politician.
And today, we have what is perhaps our most offensive definition,
at least to me, which is the following:
To doodle officially means
to dawdle,
to dilly dally, to monkey around,
to make meaningless marks,
to do something of little value, substance or import,
and -- my personal favorite --
to do nothing.
No wonder people are averse to doodling at work.
Doing nothing at work is akin to masturbating at work;
it's totally inappropriate.
(Laughter)
Additionally, I've heard horror stories
from people whose teachers scolded them, of course, for doodling in classrooms.
And they have bosses who scold them for doodling in the boardroom.
There is a powerful cultural norm against doodling
in settings in which we are supposed to learn something.
And unfortunately,
the press tends to reinforce this norm
when they're reporting on a doodling scene --
of an important person at a confirmation hearing and the like --
they typically use words like "discovered"
or "caught" or "found out,"
as if there's some sort of criminal act being committed.
And additionally, there is a psychological aversion to doodling --
thank you, Freud.
In the 1930s, Freud told us all
that you could analyze people's psyches
based on their doodles.
This is not accurate, but it did happen to Tony Blair
at the Davos Forum in 2005,
when his doodles were, of course, "discovered"
and he was labeled the following things.
Now it turned out to be Bill Gates' doodle.
(Laughter)
And Bill, if you're here, nobody thinks you're megalomaniacal.
But that does contribute
to people not wanting to share their doodles.
And here is the real deal. Here's what I believe.
I think that our culture
is so intensely focused on verbal information
that we're almost blinded to the value of doodling.
And I'm not comfortable with that.
And so because of that belief that I think needs to be burst,
I'm here to send us all hurtling back to the truth.
And here's the truth:
doodling is an incredibly powerful tool,
and it is a tool that we need to remember and to re-learn.
So here's a new definition for doodling.
And I hope there's someone in here from The Oxford English Dictionary,
because I want to talk to you later.
Here's the real definition:
Doodling is really to make spontaneous marks to help yourself think.
That is why millions of people doodle.
Here's another interesting truth about the doodle:
People who doodle when they're exposed to verbal information
retain more of that information
than their non-doodling counterparts.
We think doodling is something you do when you lose focus,
but in reality, it is a preemptive measure
to stop you from losing focus.
Additionally, it has a profound effect
on creative problem-solving
and deep information processing.
There are four ways that learners intake information
so that they can make decisions.
They are visual, auditory,
reading and writing and kinesthetic.
Now in order for us to really chew on information
and do something with it,
we have to engage at least two of those modalities,
or we have to engage one of those modalities
coupled with an emotional experience.
The incredible contribution of the doodle
is that it engages all four learning modalities simultaneously
with the possibility of an emotional experience.
That is a pretty solid contribution
for a behavior equated with doing nothing.
This is so nerdy,
but this made me cry when I discovered this.
So they did anthropological research
into the unfolding of artistic activity in children,
and they found that, across space and time,
all children exhibit the same evolution in visual logic
as they grow.
In other words, they have a shared and growing
complexity in visual language
that happens in a predictable order.
And I think that is incredible.
I think that means doodling is native to us
and we simply are denying ourselves that instinct.
And finally, a lot a people aren't privy to this,
but the doodle is a precursor
to some of our greatest cultural assets.
This is but one:
this is Frank Gehry the architect's precursor to the Guggenheim in Abu Dhabi.
So here is my point:
Under no circumstances should doodling be eradicated
from a classroom or a boardroom
or even the war room.
On the contrary,
doodling should be leveraged in precisely those situations
where information density is very high
and the need for processing that information is very high.
And I will go you one further.
Because doodling is so universally accessible
and it is not intimidating as an art form,
it can be leveraged as a portal
through which we move people
into higher levels of visual literacy.
My friends, the doodle has never been
the nemesis of intellectual thought.
In reality, it is one of its greatest allies.
Thank you.
(Applause)
I want to talk about the transformed media landscape,
and what it means for anybody who has a message that they want to get out
to anywhere in the world.
And I want to illustrate that by telling a couple of stories
about that transformation.
I'll start here. Last November there was a presidential election.
You probably read something about it in the papers.
And there was some concern that in some parts of the country
there might be voter suppression.
And so a plan came up to video the vote.
And the idea was that individual citizens
with phones capable of taking photos or making video
would document their polling places,
on the lookout for any kind of voter suppression techniques,
and would upload this to a central place.
And that this would operate as a kind of citizen observation --
that citizens would not be there just to cast individual votes,
but also to help ensure the sanctity of the vote overall.
So this is a pattern that assumes we're all in this together.
What matters here
isn't technical capital,
it's social capital.
These tools don't get socially interesting
until they get technologically boring.
It isn't when the shiny new tools show up
that their uses start permeating society.
It's when everybody is able to take them for granted.
Because now that media is increasingly social,
innovation can happen anywhere
that people can take for granted the idea that we're all in this together.
And so we're starting to see a media landscape
in which innovation is happening everywhere,
and moving from one spot to another.
That is a huge transformation.
Not to put too fine a point on it, the moment we're living through --
the moment our historical generation is living through --
is the largest increase in expressive capability
in human history.
Now that's a big claim. I'm going to try to back it up.
There are only four periods in the last 500 years
where media has changed enough to qualify for the label "revolution."
The first one is the famous one, the printing press:
movable type, oil-based inks, that whole complex of innovations
that made printing possible
and turned Europe upside-down, starting in the middle of the 1400s.
Then, a couple of hundred years ago,
there was innovation in two-way communication,
conversational media: first the telegraph, then the telephone.
Slow, text-based conversations,
then real-time voice based conversations.
Then, about 150 years ago,
there was a revolution in recorded media other than print:
first photos, then recorded sound,
then movies, all encoded onto physical objects.
And finally, about 100 years ago, the harnessing of electromagnetic spectrum
to send sound and images through the air -- radio and television.
This is the media landscape as we knew it in the 20th century.
This is what those of us of a certain age
grew up with, and are used to.
But there is a curious asymmetry here.
The media that is good at creating conversations
is no good at creating groups.
And the media that's good at creating groups
is no good at creating conversations.
If you want to have a conversation
in this world, you have it with one other person.
If you want to address a group, you get the same message
and you give it to everybody in the group,
whether you're doing that with a broadcasting tower or a printing press.
That was the media landscape
as we had it in the twentieth century.
And this is what changed.
This thing that looks like a peacock hit a windscreen
is Bill Cheswick's map of the Internet.
He traces the edges of the individual networks
and then color codes them.
The Internet is the first medium in history
that has native support for groups
and conversation at the same time.
Whereas the phone gave us the one-to-one pattern,
and television, radio, magazines, books,
gave us the one-to-many pattern,
the Internet gives us the many-to-many pattern.
For the first time,
media is natively good at supporting these kinds of conversations.
That's one of the big changes.
The second big change
is that, as all media gets digitized,
the Internet also becomes the mode of carriage
for all other media,
meaning that phone calls migrate to the Internet,
magazines migrate to the Internet, movies migrate to the Internet.
And that means that every medium
is right next door to every other medium.
Put another way,
media is increasingly less just a source of information,
and it is increasingly more a site of coordination,
because groups that see or hear or watch or listen to something
can now gather around and talk to each other as well.
And the third big change
is that members of the former audience, as Dan Gilmore calls them,
can now also be producers and not consumers.
Every time a new consumer
joins this media landscape
a new producer joins as well,
because the same equipment --
phones, computers --
let you consume and produce.
It's as if, when you bought a book, they threw in the printing press for free;
it's like you had a phone that could turn into a radio
if you pressed the right buttons.
That is a huge change
in the media landscape we're used to.
And it's not just Internet or no Internet.
We've had the Internet in its public form
for almost 20 years now,
and it's still changing
as the media becomes more social.
It's still changing patterns
even among groups who know how to deal with the Internet well.
Second story.
Last May, China in the Sichuan province
had a terrible earthquake, 7.9 magnitude,
massive destruction in a wide area, as the Richter Scale has it.
And the earthquake was reported as it was happening.
People were texting from their phones. They were taking photos of buildings.
They were taking videos of buildings shaking.
They were uploading it to QQ, China's largest Internet service.
They were Twittering it.
And so as the quake was happening
the news was reported.
And because of the social connections,
Chinese students coming elsewhere, and going to school,
or businesses in the rest of the world opening offices in China --
there were people listening all over the world, hearing this news.
The BBC got their first wind of the Chinese quake from Twitter.
Twitter announced the existence of the quake
several minutes before the US Geological Survey
had anything up online for anybody to read.
The last time China had a quake of that magnitude
it took them three months to admit that it had happened.
(Laughter)
Now they might have liked to have done that here,
rather than seeing these pictures go up online.
But they weren't given that choice,
because their own citizens beat them to the punch.
Even the government learned of the earthquake from their own citizens,
rather than from the Xinhua News Agency.
And this stuff rippled like wildfire.
For a while there
the top 10 most clicked links on Twitter,
the global short messaging service --
nine of the top 10 links were about the quake.
People collating information,
pointing people to news sources,
pointing people to the US geological survey.
The 10th one was kittens on a treadmill, but that's the Internet for you.
(Laughter)
But nine of the 10 in those first hours.
And within half a day donation sites were up,
and donations were pouring in from all around the world.
This was an incredible, coordinated global response.
And the Chinese then, in one of their periods of media openness,
decided that they were going to let it go,
that they were going to let this citizen reporting fly.
And then this happened.
People began to figure out, in the Sichuan Provence,
that the reason so many school buildings had collapsed --
because tragically the earthquake happened during a school day --
the reason so many school buildings collapsed
is that corrupt officials had taken bribes
to allow those building to be built to less than code.
And so they started, the citizen journalists started
reporting that as well. And there was an incredible picture.
You may have seen in on the front page of the New York Times.
A local official literally prostrated himself in the street,
in front of these protesters,
in order to get them to go away.
Essentially to say, "We will do anything to placate you,
just please stop protesting in public."
But these are people who have been radicalized,
because, thanks to the one child policy,
they have lost everyone in their next generation.
Someone who has seen the death of a single child
now has nothing to lose.
And so the protest kept going.
And finally the Chinese cracked down.
That was enough of citizen media.
And so they began to arrest the protesters.
They began to shut down the media that the protests were happening on.
China is probably the most successful
manager of Internet censorship in the world,
using something that is widely described as the Great Firewall of China.
And the Great Firewall of China
is a set of observation points
that assume that media is produced by professionals,
it mostly comes in from the outside world,
it comes in relatively sparse chunks,
and it comes in relatively slowly.
And because of those four characteristics
they are able to filter it as it comes into the country.
But like the Maginot Line,
the great firewall of China was facing in the wrong direction
for this challenge,
because not one of those four things was true in this environment.
The media was produced locally. It was produced by amateurs.
It was produced quickly. And it was produced at such an incredible abundance
that there was no way to filter it as it appeared.
And so now the Chinese government, who for a dozen years,
has quite successfully filtered the web,
is now in the position of having to decide
whether to allow or shut down entire services,
because the transformation to amateur media
is so enormous that they can't deal with it any other way.
And in fact that is happening this week.
On the 20th anniversary of Tiananmen
they just, two days ago, announced
that they were simply shutting down access to Twitter,
because there was no way to filter it other than that.
They had to turn the spigot entirely off.
Now these changes don't just affect people who want to censor messages.
They also affect people who want to send messages,
because this is really a transformation of the ecosystem as a whole,
not just a particular strategy.
The classic media problem, from the 20th century
is, how does an organization have a message
that they want to get out
to a group of people distributed at the edges of a network.
And here is the twentieth century answer.
Bundle up the message. Send the same message to everybody.
National message. Targeted individuals.
Relatively sparse number of producers.
Very expensive to do,
so there is not a lot of competition.
This is how you reach people.
All of that is over.
We are increasingly in a landscape where media is global,
social, ubiquitous and cheap.
Now most organizations that are trying to send messages
to the outside world, to the distributed collection of the audience,
are now used to this change.
The audience can talk back.
And that's a little freaky. But you can get used to it after a while, as people do.
But that's not the really crazy change that we're living in the middle of.
The really crazy change is here:
it's the fact that they are no longer disconnected from each other,
the fact that former consumers are now producers,
the fact that the audience can talk directly to one another;
because there is a lot more amateurs than professionals,
and because the size of the network,
the complexity of the network is actually the square
of the number of participants,
meaning that the network, when it grows large,
grows very, very large.
As recently at last decade,
most of the media that was available for public consumption
was produced by professionals.
Those days are over, never to return.
It is the green lines now, that are the source of the free content,
which brings me to my last story.
We saw some of the most imaginative use
of social media during the Obama campaign.
And I don't mean most imaginative use in politics --
I mean most imaginative use ever.
And one of the things Obama did, was they famously,
the Obama campaign did, was they famously put up
MyBarackObama.com, myBO.com
And millions of citizens rushed in to participate,
and to try and figure out how to help.
An incredible conversation sprung up there.
And then, this time last year,
Obama announced that he was going to change his vote on FISA,
The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.
He had said, in January, that he would not sign a bill
that granted telecom immunity for possibly warrantless spying
on American persons.
By the summer, in the middle of the general campaign,
He said, "I've thought about the issue more. I've changed my mind.
I'm going to vote for this bill."
And many of his own supporters
on his own site went very publicly berserk.
It was Senator Obama when they created it. They changed the name later.
"Please get FISA right."
Within days of this group being created
it was the fastest growing group on myBO.com;
within weeks of its being created it was the largest group.
Obama had to issue a press release.
He had to issue a reply.
And he said essentially, "I have considered the issue.
I understand where you are coming from.
But having considered it all, I'm still going to vote the way I'm going to vote.
But I wanted to reach out to you and say, I understand that you disagree with me,
and I'm going to take my lumps on this one."
This didn't please anybody. But then a funny thing happened in the conversation.
People in that group realized
that Obama had never shut them down.
Nobody in the Obama campaign had ever tried to hide the group
or make it harder to join,
to deny its existence, to delete it,
to take to off the site.
They had understood that their role
with myBO.com was to convene their supporters
but not to control their supporters.
And that is the kind of discipline
that it takes to make really mature use
of this media.
Media, the media landscape that we knew,
as familiar as it was, as easy conceptually as it was
to deal with the idea that professionals broadcast
messages to amateurs,
is increasingly slipping away.
In a world where media is global, social, ubiquitous and cheap,
in a world of media where the former audience
are now increasingly full participants,
in that world, media is less and less often
about crafting a single message
to be consumed by individuals.
It is more and more often
a way of creating an environment for convening
and supporting groups.
And the choice we face,
I mean anybody who has a message they want to have heard
anywhere in the world,
isn't whether or not that is the media environment we want to operate in.
That's the media environment we've got.
The question we all face now is,
"How can we make best use of this media?
Even though it means changing the way we've always done it."
Thank you very much.

What is going on
in this baby's mind?
If you'd asked people this 30 years ago,
most people, including psychologists,
would have said that this baby was irrational,
illogical, egocentric --
that he couldn't take the perspective of another person
or understand cause and effect.
In the last 20 years,
developmental science has completely overturned that picture.
So in some ways,
we think that this baby's thinking
is like the thinking of the most brilliant scientists.
Let me give you just one example of this.
One thing that this baby could be thinking about,
that could be going on in his mind,
is trying to figure out
what's going on in the mind of that other baby.
After all, one of the things that's hardest for all of us to do
is to figure out what other people are thinking and feeling.
And maybe the hardest thing of all
is to figure out that what other people think and feel
isn't actually exactly like what we think and feel.
Anyone who's followed politics can testify
to how hard that is for some people to get.
We wanted to know
if babies and young children
could understand this really profound thing about other people.
Now the question is: How could we ask them?
Babies, after all, can't talk,
and if you ask a three year-old
to tell you what he thinks,
what you'll get is a beautiful stream of consciousness monologue
about ponies and birthdays and things like that.
So how do we actually ask them the question?
Well it turns out that the secret was broccoli.
What we did -- Betty Rapacholi, who was one of my students, and I --
was actually to give the babies two bowls of food:
one bowl of raw broccoli
and one bowl of delicious goldfish crackers.
Now all of the babies, even in Berkley,
like the crackers and don't like the raw broccoli.
(Laughter)
But then what Betty did
was to take a little taste of food from each bowl.
And she would act as if she liked it or she didn't.
So half the time, she acted
as if she liked the crackers and didn't like the broccoli --
just like a baby and any other sane person.
But half the time,
what she would do is take a little bit of the broccoli
and go, "Mmmmm, broccoli.
I tasted the broccoli. Mmmmm."
And then she would take a little bit of the crackers,
and she'd go, "Eww, yuck, crackers.
I tasted the crackers. Eww, yuck."
So she'd act as if what she wanted
was just the opposite of what the babies wanted.
We did this with 15 and 18 month-old babies.
And then she would simply put her hand out and say,
"Can you give me some?"
So the question is: What would the baby give her,
what they liked or what she liked?
And the remarkable thing was that 18 month-old babies,
just barely walking and talking,
would give her the crackers if she liked the crackers,
but they would give her the broccoli if she liked the broccoli.
On the other hand,
15 month-olds would stare at her for a long time
if she acted as if she liked the broccoli,
like they couldn't figure this out.
But then after they stared for a long time,
they would just give her the crackers,
what they thought everybody must like.
So there are two really remarkable things about this.
The first one is that these little 18 month-old babies
have already discovered
this really profound fact about human nature,
that we don't always want the same thing.
And what's more, they felt that they should actually do things
to help other people get what they wanted.
Even more remarkably though,
the fact that 15 month-olds didn't do this
suggests that these 18 month-olds had learned
this deep, profound fact about human nature
in the three months from when they were 15 months old.
So children both know more and learn more
than we ever would have thought.
And this is just one of hundreds and hundreds of studies over the last 20 years
that's actually demonstrated it.
The question you might ask though is:
Why do children learn so much?
And how is it possible for them to learn so much
in such a short time?
I mean, after all, if you look at babies superficially,
they seem pretty useless.
And actually in many ways, they're worse than useless,
because we have to put so much time and energy
into just keeping them alive.
But if we turn to evolution
for an answer to this puzzle
of why we spend so much time
taking care of useless babies,
it turns out that there's actually an answer.
If we look across many, many different species of animals,
not just us primates,
but also including other mammals, birds,
even marsupials
like kangaroos and wombats,
it turns out that there's a relationship
between how long a childhood a species has
and how big their brains are compared to their bodies
and how smart and flexible they are.
And sort of the posterbirds for this idea are the birds up there.
On one side
is a New Caledonian crow.
And crows and other corvidae, ravens, rooks and so forth,
are incredibly smart birds.
They're as smart as chimpanzees in some respects.
And this is a bird on the cover of science
who's learned how to use a tool to get food.
On the other hand,
we have our friend the domestic chicken.
And chickens and ducks and geese and turkeys
are basically as dumb as dumps.
So they're very, very good at pecking for grain,
and they're not much good at doing anything else.
Well it turns out that the babies,
the New Caledonian crow babies, are fledglings.
They depend on their moms
to drop worms in their little open mouths
for as long as two years,
which is a really long time in the life of a bird.
Whereas the chickens are actually mature
within a couple of months.
So childhood is the reason
why the crows end up on the cover of Science
and the chickens end up in the soup pot.
There's something about that long childhood
that seems to be connected
to knowledge and learning.
Well what kind of explanation could we have for this?
Well some animals, like the chicken,
seem to be beautifully suited
to doing just one thing very well.
So they seem to be beautifully suited
to pecking grain in one environment.
Other creatures, like the crows,
aren't very good at doing anything in particular,
but they're extremely good
at learning about laws of different environments.
And of course, we human beings
are way out on the end of the distribution like the crows.
We have bigger brains relative to our bodies
by far than any other animal.
We're smarter, we're more flexible,
we can learn more,
we survive in more different environments,
we migrated to cover the world and even go to outer space.
And our babies and children are dependent on us
for much longer than the babies of any other species.
My son is 23.
(Laughter)
And at least until they're 23,
we're still popping those worms
into those little open mouths.
All right, why would we see this correlation?
Well an idea is that that strategy, that learning strategy,
is an extremely powerful, great strategy for getting on in the world,
but it has one big disadvantage.
And that one big disadvantage
is that, until you actually do all that learning,
you're going to be helpless.
So you don't want to have the mastodon charging at you
and be saying to yourself,
"A slingshot or maybe a spear might work. Which would actually be better?"
You want to know all that
before the mastodons actually show up.
And the way the evolutions seems to have solved that problem
is with a kind of division of labor.
So the idea is that we have this early period when we're completely protected.
We don't have to do anything. All we have to do is learn.
And then as adults,
we can take all those things that we learned when we were babies and children
and actually put them to work to do things out there in the world.
So one way of thinking about it
is that babies and young children
are like the research and development division of the human species.
So they're the protected blue sky guys
who just have to go out and learn and have good ideas,
and we're production and marketing.
We have to take all those ideas
that we learned when we were children
and actually put them to use.
Another way of thinking about it
is instead of thinking of babies and children
as being like defective grownups,
we should think about them
as being a different developmental stage of the same species --
kind of like caterpillars and butterflies --
except that they're actually the brilliant butterflies
who are flitting around the garden and exploring,
and we're the caterpillars
who are inching along our narrow, grownup, adult path.
If this is true, if these babies are designed to learn --
and this evolutionary story would say children are for learning,
that's what they're for --
we might expect
that they would have really powerful learning mechanisms.
And in fact, the baby's brain
seems to be the most powerful learning computer
on the planet.
But real computers are actually getting to be a lot better.
And there's been a revolution
in our understanding of machine learning recently.
And it all depends on the ideas of this guy,
the Reverend Thomas Bayes,
who was a statistician and mathematician in the 18th century.
And essentially what Bayes did
was to provide a mathematical way
using probability theory
to characterize, describe,
the way that scientists find out about the world.
So what scientists do
is they have a hypothesis that they think might be likely to start with.
They go out and test it against the evidence.
The evidence makes them change that hypothesis.
Then they test that new hypothesis
and so on and so forth.
And what Bayes showed was a mathematical way that you could do that.
And that mathematics is at the core
of the best machine learning programs that we have now.
And some 10 years ago,
I suggested that babies might be doing the same thing.
So if you want to know what's going on
underneath those beautiful brown eyes,
I think it actually looks something like this.
This is Reverend Bayes's notebook.
So I think those babies are actually making complicated calculations
with conditional probabilities that they're revising
to figure out how the world works.
All right, now that might seem like an even taller order to actually demonstrate.
Because after all, if you ask even grownups about statistics,
they look extremely stupid.
How could it be that children are doing statistics?
So to test this we used a machine that we have
called the Blicket Detector.
This is a box that lights up and plays music
when you put some things on it and not others.
And using this very simple machine,
my lab and others have done dozens of studies
showing just how good babies are
at learning about the world.
Let me mention just one
that we did with Tumar Kushner, my student.
If I showed you this detector,
you would be likely to think to begin with
that the way to make the detector go
would be to put a block on top of the detector.
But actually, this detector
works in a bit of a strange way.
Because if you wave a block over the top of the detector,
something you wouldn't ever think of to begin with,
the detector will actually activate two out of three times.
Whereas, if you do the likely thing, put the block on the detector,
it will only activate two out of six times.
So the unlikely hypothesis
actually has stronger evidence.
It looks as if the waving
is a more effective strategy than the other strategy.
So we did just this; we gave four year-olds this pattern of evidence,
and we just asked them to make it go.
And sure enough, the four year-olds used the evidence
to wave the object on top of the detector.
Now there are two things that are really interesting about this.
The first one is, again, remember, these are four year-olds.
They're just learning how to count.
But unconsciously,
they're doing these quite complicated calculations
that will give them a conditional probability measure.
And the other interesting thing
is that they're using that evidence
to get to an idea, get to a hypothesis about the world,
that seems very unlikely to begin with.
And in studies we've just been doing in my lab, similar studies,
we've show that four year-olds are actually better
at finding out an unlikely hypothesis
than adults are when we give them exactly the same task.
So in these circumstances,
the children are using statistics to find out about the world,
but after all, scientists also do experiments,
and we wanted to see if children are doing experiments.
When children do experiments we call it "getting into everything"
or else "playing."
And there's been a bunch of interesting studies recently
that have shown this playing around
is really a kind of experimental research program.
Here's one from Cristine Legare's lab.
What Cristine did was use our Blicket Detectors.
And what she did was show children
that yellow ones made it go and red ones didn't,
and then she showed them an anomaly.
And what you'll see
is that this little boy will go through five hypotheses
in the space of two minutes.
(Video) Boy: How about this?
Same as the other side.
Alison Gopnik: Okay, so his first hypothesis has just been falsified.
(Laughter)
Boy: This one lighted up, and this one nothing.
AG: Okay, he's got his experimental notebook out.
Boy: What's making this light up.
(Laughter)
I don't know.
AG: Every scientist will recognize that expression of despair.
(Laughter)
Boy: Oh, it's because this needs to be like this,
and this needs to be like this.
AG: Okay, hypothesis two.
Boy: That's why.
Oh.
(Laughter)
AG: Now this is his next idea.
He told the experimenter to do this,
to try putting it out onto the other location.
Not working either.
Boy: Oh, because the light goes only to here,
not here.
Oh, the bottom of this box
has electricity in here,
but this doesn't have electricity.
AG: Okay, that's a fourth hypothesis.
Boy: It's lighting up.
So when you put four.
So you put four on this one to make it light up
and two on this one to make it light up.
AG: Okay,there's his fifth hypothesis.
Now that is a particularly --
that is a particularly adorable and articulate little boy,
but what Cristine discovered is this is actually quite typical.
If you look at the way children play, when you ask them to explain something,
what they really do is do a series of experiments.
This is actually pretty typical of four year-olds.
Well, what's it like to be this kind of creature?
What's it like to be one of these brilliant butterflies
who can test five hypotheses in two minutes?
Well, if you go back to those psychologists and philosophers,
a lot of them have said
that babies and young children were barely conscious
if they were conscious at all.
And I think just the opposite is true.
I think babies and children are actually more conscious than we are as adults.
Now here's what we know about how adult consciousness works.
And adults' attention and consciousness
look kind of like a spotlight.
So what happens for adults
is we decide that something's relevant or important,
we should pay attention to it.
Our consciousness of that thing that we're attending to
becomes extremely bright and vivid,
and everything else sort of goes dark.
And we even know something about the way the brain does this.
So what happens when we pay attention
is that the prefrontal cortex, the sort of executive part of our brains,
sends a signal
that makes a little part of our brain much more flexible,
more plastic, better at learning,
and shuts down activity
in all the rest of our brains.
So we have a very focused, purpose-driven kind of attention.
If we look at babies and young children,
we see something very different.
I think babies and young children
seem to have more of a lantern of consciousness
than a spotlight of consciousness.
So babies and young children are very bad
at narrowing down to just one thing.
But they're very good at taking in lots of information
from lots of different sources at once.
And if you actually look in their brains,
you see that they're flooded with these neurotransmitters
that are really good at inducing learning and plasticity,
and the inhibitory parts haven't come on yet.
So when we say that babies and young children
are bad at paying attention,
what we really mean is that they're bad at not paying attention.
So they're bad at getting rid
of all the interesting things that could tell them something
and just looking at the thing that's important.
That's the kind of attention, the kind of consciousness,
that we might expect
from those butterflies who are designed to learn.
Well if we want to think about a way
of getting a taste of that kind of baby consciousness as adults,
I think the best thing is think about cases
where we're put in a new situation that we've never been in before --
when we fall in love with someone new,
or when we're in a new city for the first time.
And what happens then is not that our consciousness contracts,
it expands,
so that those three days in Paris
seem to be more full of consciousness and experience
than all the months of being
a walking, talking, faculty meeting-attending zombie back home.
And by the way, that coffee,
that wonderful coffee you've been drinking downstairs,
actually mimics the effect
of those baby neurotransmitters.
So what's it like to be a baby?
It's like being in love
in Paris for the first time
after you've had three double-espressos.
(Laughter)
That's a fantastic way to be,
but it does tend to leave you waking up crying at three o'clock in the morning.
(Laughter)
Now it's good to be a grownup.
I don't want to say too much about how wonderful babies are.
It's good to be a grownup.
We can do things like tie our shoelaces and cross the street by ourselves.
And it makes sense that we put a lot of effort
into making babies think like adults do.
But if what we want is to be like those butterflies,
to have open-mindedness, open learning,
imagination, creativity, innovation,
maybe at least some of the time
we should be getting the adults
to start thinking more like children.
(Applause)
When I was 10 years old,
a cousin of mine took me on a tour of his medical school.
And as a special treat,
he took me to the pathology lab
and took a real human brain
out of the jar
and placed it in my hands.
And there it was,
the seat of human consciousness,
the powerhouse of the human body,
sitting in my hands.
And that day I knew that when I grew up,
I was going to become a brain doctor,
scientist, something or the other.
Years later, when I finally grew up,
my dream came true.
And it was while I was doing my Ph.D.
on the neurological causes
of dyslexia in children
that I encountered a startling fact
that I'd like to share with you all today.
It is estimated that one in six children,
that's one in six children,
suffer from some developmental disorder.
This is a disorder that
retards mental development in the child
and causes permanent mental impairments.
Which means that each and every one of you here today
knows at least one child that is suffering
from a developmental disorder.
But here's what really perplexed me.
Despite the fact that each
and every one of these disorders
originates in the brain,
most of these disorders
are diagnosed solely on the basis
of observable behavior.
But diagnosing a brain disorder
without actually looking at the brain
is analogous to treating a patient with a heart problem
based on their physical symptoms,
without even doing an ECG or a chest X-ray
to look at the heart.
It seemed so intuitive to me.
To diagnose and treat a brain disorder accurately,
it would be necessary to look at the brain directly.
Looking at behavior alone
can miss a vital piece of the puzzle
and provide an incomplete, or even a misleading,
picture of the child's problems.
Yet, despite all the advances in medical technology,
the diagnosis of brain disorders
in one in six children
still remained so limited.
And then I came across a team at Harvard University
that had taken one such advanced medical technology
and finally applied it,
instead of in brain research,
towards diagnosing brain disorders in children.
Their groundbreaking technology
records the EEG, or the electrical activity
of the brain, in real time,
allowing us to watch the brain
as it performs various functions
and then detect even the slightest abnormality
in any of these functions:
vision, attention, language, audition.
A program called Brain Electrical
Activity Mapping
then triangulates the source
of that abnormality in the brain.
And another program called
Statistical Probability Mapping
then performs mathematical calculations
to determine whether any of these abnormalities
are clinically significant,
allowing us to provide a much more accurate
neurological diagnosis
of the child's symptoms.
And so I became the head of neurophysiology
for the clinical arm of this team,
and we're finally able to use this technology
towards actually helping
children with brain disorders.
And I'm happy to say that I'm now in the process
of setting up this technology here in India.
I'd like to tell you about one such child,
whose story was also covered by ABC News.
Seven-year-old Justin Senigar
came to our clinic with this diagnosis
of very severe autism.
Like many autistic children,
his mind was locked inside his body.
There were moments when he would
actually space out for seconds at a time.
And the doctors told his parents
he was never going to be able
to communicate or interact socially,
and he would probably never have too much language.
When we used this groundbreaking EEG technology
to actually look at Justin's brain,
the results were startling.
It turned out that Justin was almost
certainly not autistic.
He was suffering from brain seizures
that were impossible to see with the naked eye,
but that were actually causing symptoms
that mimicked those of autism.
After Justin was given anti-seizure medication,
the change in him was amazing.
Within a period of 60 days,
his vocabulary went from two to three words
to 300 words.
And his communication and social interaction
were improved so dramatically
that he was enrolled into a regular school
and even became a karate super champ.
Research shows that 50 percent of children,
almost 50 percent of children
diagnosed with autism
are actually suffering from hidden brain seizures.
These are the faces of the children
that I have tested
with stories just like Justin.
All these children
came to our clinic with a diagnosis
of autism, attention deficit disorder,
mental retardation, language problems.
Instead, our EEG scans revealed
very specific problems hidden within their brains
that couldn't possibly have been detected
by their behavioral assessments.
So these EEG scans
enabled us to provide these children
with a much more accurate neurological diagnosis
and much more targeted treatment.
For too long now, children with developmental disorders
have suffered from misdiagnosis
while their real problems have gone undetected
and left to worsen.
And for too long, these children and their parents
have suffered undue frustration and desperation.
But we are now in a new era of neuroscience,
one in which we can finally look
directly at brain function in real time
with no risks and no side effects, non-invasively,
and find the true source
of so many disabilities in children.
So if I could inspire
even a fraction of you in the audience today
to share this pioneering diagnostic approach
with even one parent whose child
is suffering from a developmental disorder,
then perhaps one more puzzle
in one more brain will be solved.
One more mind will be unlocked.
And one more child who has been misdiagnosed
or even undiagnosed by the system
will finally realize his or her true potential
while there's still time
for his or her brain to recover.
And all this by simply watching the child's brainwaves.
Thank you.
(Applause)
I'm a professional troublemaker.
(Laughter)
As my job is to critique the world,
the shoddy systems and the people
who refuse to do better,
as a writer, as a speaker,
as a shady Nigerian --
(Laughter)
I feel like my purpose is to be this cat.
(Laughter)
I am the person
who is looking at other people,
like, "I need you to fix it."
That is me.
I want us to leave this world
better than we found it.
And how I choose to effect change
is by speaking up,
by being the first
and by being the domino.
For a line of dominoes to fall,
one has to fall first,
which then leaves the other
choiceless to do the same.
And that domino that falls,
we're hoping that, OK,
the next person that sees this
is inspired to be a domino.
Being the domino, for me,
looks like speaking up
and doing the things
that are really difficult,
especially when they are needed,
with the hope that others
will follow suit.
And here's the thing:
I'm the person who says
what you might be thinking
but dared not to say.
A lot of times people think
that we're fearless,
the people who do this, we're fearless.
We're not fearless.
We're not unafraid of the consequences
or the sacrifices that we have to make
by speaking truth to power.
What happens is, we feel like we have to,
because there are too few
people in the world
willing to be the domino,
too few people willing to take that fall.
We're not doing it without fear.
Now, let's talk about fear.
I knew exactly what I wanted
to be when I grew up.
I was like, "I'm going to be a doctor!"
Doctor Luvvie was the dream.
I was Doc McStuffins
before it was a thing.
(Laughter)
And I remember when I went to college,
my freshman year,
I had to take Chemistry 101
for my premed major.
I got the first and last D
of my academic career.
(Laughter)
So I went to my advisor, and I was like,
"OK, let's drop the premed,
because this doctor thing
is not going to work,
because I don't even like hospitals.
So ..."
(Laughter)
"Let's just consider that done for."
And that same semester,
I started blogging.
That was 2003.
So as that one dream was ending,
another was beginning.
And then what was a cute hobby
became my full-time job
when I lost my marketing job in 2010.
But it still took me two more years
to say, "I'm a writer."
Nine years after I had started writing,
before I said, "I'm a writer,"
because I was afraid of what happens
without 401ks,
without, "How am I going
to keep up my shoe habit?
That's important to me."
(Laughter)
So it took me that long to own this thing
that was what my purpose was.
And then I realized,
fear has a very concrete power
of keeping us from doing and saying
the things that are our purpose.
And I was like, "You know what?
I'm not going to let fear rule my life.
I'm not going to let fear
dictate what I do."
And then all of these
awesome things started happening,
and dominoes started to fall.
So when I realized that,
I was like, "OK, 2015,
I turned 30,
it's going to be my year
of 'Do it anyway.'
Anything that scares me,
I'm going to actively pursue it."
So, I'm a Capricorn.
I like my feel solidly on the ground.
I decided to take
my first-ever solo vacation,
and it was out of the country
to the Dominican Republic.
So on my birthday, what did I do?
I went ziplining through
the forests of Punta Cana.
And for some odd reason,
I had on business casual.
Don't ask why.
(Laughter)
And I had an incredible time.
Also, I don't like being
submerged in water.
I like to be, again, on solid ground.
So I went to Mexico
and swam with dolphins underwater.
And then the cool thing
that I did also that year
that was my mountain
was I wrote my book,
"I'm Judging You: The Do-Better Manual,"
And I had to own --
(Applause)
that whole writing thing now, right?
Yes.
But the very anti-me thing
that I did that year
that scared the crap out of me --
I went skydiving.
We're about to fall out of the plane.
I was like, "I've done some stupid
things in life. This is one of them."
(Laughter)
And then we come falling down to Earth,
and I literally lose my breath
as I see Earth, and I was like,
"I just fell out of a perfectly good
plane on purpose."
(Laughter)
"What is wrong with me?!"
But then I looked down at the beauty,
and I was like, "This is
the best thing I could have done.
This was an amazing decision."
And I think about the times
when I have to speak truth.
It feels like I am falling
out of that plane.
It feels like that moment
when I'm at the edge of the plane,
and I'm like, "You shouldn't do this,"
but then I do it anyway,
because I realize I have to.
Sitting at the edge of that plane
and kind of staying on that plane
is comfort to me.
And I feel like every day
that I'm speaking truth
against institutions and people
who are bigger than me
and just forces that are
more powerful than me,
I feel like I'm falling out of that plane.
But I realize comfort is overrated.
Because being quiet is comfortable.
Keeping things the way
they've been is comfortable.
And all comfort has done
is maintain the status quo.
So we've got to get comfortable
with being uncomfortable
by speaking these hard truths
when they're necessary.
And I --
(Applause)
And for me, though, I realize
that I have to speak these truths,
because honesty is so important to me.
My integrity is something I hold dear.
Justice -- I don't think justice
should be an option.
We should always have justice.
Also, I believe in shea butter
as a core value, and --
(Laughter)
and I think the world would be better
if we were more moisturized.
But besides that, with these
as my core values,
I have to speak the truth.
I have no other choice in the matter.
But people like me,
the professional troublemakers,
should not be the only ones who are
committed to being these dominoes
who are always falling out of planes
or being the first one to take this hit.
People are so afraid
of these acute consequences,
not realizing that there are many times
when we walk in rooms
and we are some of the most
powerful people in those rooms --
we might be the second-most powerful,
third-most powerful.
And I firmly believe
that our job in those times
is to disrupt what is happening.
And then if we're not the most powerful,
if two more of us band together,
it makes us powerful.
It's like cosigning
the woman in the meeting,
you know, the woman
who can't seem to get her word out,
or just making sure that other person
who can't make a point
is being heard.
Our job is to make sure
they have room for that.
Everyone's well-being
is community business.
If we made that a point,
we'd understand that,
for the times when we need help,
we wouldn't have to look around so hard
if we made sure
we were somebody else's help.
And there are times when I feel like
I have taken very public
tumbles and falls,
like the time when I was asked
to speak at a conference,
and they wanted me to pay my way there.
And then I did some research
and found out the white men
who spoke there got compensated
and got their travel paid for.
The white women who spoke there
got their travel paid for.
The black women who spoke there were
expected to actually pay to speak there.
And I was like, "What do I do?"
And I knew that if I spoke up
about this publicly,
I could face financial loss.
But then I also understood
that my silence serves no one.
So I fearfully spoke up about it publicly,
and other women started
coming out to talk about,
"I, too, have faced
this type of pay inequality."
And it started a conversation
about discriminatory pay practices
that this conference was participating in.
I felt like I was the domino
the time I read a disturbing
memoir by a public figure
and wrote a piece about it.
I knew this person was more powerful
than me and could impact my career,
but I was like, "I've got to do this.
I've got to sit at the edge
of this plane," maybe for two hours.
And I did. And I pressed
"Publish," and I ran away.
(Laughter)
And I came back to a viral post
and people being like, "Oh my God,
I'm so glad somebody finally said this."
And it started a conversation
about mental health and self-care,
and I was like, "OK. Alright.
This thing that I'm doing,
I guess, alright, it's doing something."
And then so many people
have been the domino
when they talk about how
they've been assaulted by powerful men.
And it's made millions of women
join in and say, "Me Too."
So, a shout-out to Tarana Burke
for igniting that movement.
(Applause)
People and systems count on our silence
to keep us exactly where we are.
Now, being the domino sometimes
comes down to being exactly who you are.
So, I've been a shady somebody
since I was three.
(Laughter)
This is me on my third birthday.
But I've been this girl all my life,
and I feel like
even that's been the domino,
because in a world
that wants us to walk around
as representatives of ourselves,
being yourself can be a revolutionary act.
And in a world that wants us to whisper,
I choose to yell.
(Applause)
When it's time to say these hard things,
I ask myself three things.
One: Did you mean it?
Two: Can you defend it?
Three: Did you say it with love?
If the answer is yes to all three,
I say it and let the chips fall.
That's important.
That checkpoint with myself
always tells me, "Yes,
you're supposed to do this."
Telling the truth --
telling thoughtful truths --
should not be a revolutionary act.
Speaking truths to power
should not be sacrificial, but they are.
But I think if more of us chose
to do this for the greater good,
we'd be in better spaces
than we are right now.
Speaking of the greater good,
I think we commit ourselves
to telling truths to build bridges
to common ground,
and bridges that aren't based
on truth will collapse.
So it is our job,
it is our obligation, it is our duty
to speak truth to power, to be the domino,
not just when it's difficult --
especially when it's difficult.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Nina Dølvik Brochmann:
We grew up believing
that the hymen is a proof of virginity.
But it turns out, we were wrong.
What we discovered
is that the popular story we're told
about female virginity
is based on two anatomical myths.
The truth has been known
in medical communities for over 100 years,
yet somehow these two myths
continue to make life difficult
for women around the world.
Ellen Støkken Dahl:
The first myth is about blood.
It tells us that the hymen
breaks and bleeds
the first time a woman has vaginal sex.
In other words, if there is no blood
on the sheets afterwards,
then the woman was simply not a virgin.
The second myth is a logical
consequence of the first.
Since the hymen is thought
to break and bleed,
people also believe
that it actually disappears
or is in some way radically altered
during a woman's first intercourse.
If that were true,
one would easily be able to determine
if a woman is a virgin or not
by examining her genitals,
by doing a virginity check.
NDB: So that's our two myths:
virgins bleed,
and hymens are lost forever.
Now, this may sound
like a minor issue to you.
Why should you care
about an obscure little skin fold
on the female body?
But the truth is,
this is about so much more
than an anatomical misunderstanding.
The myths about the hymen
have lived on for centuries
because they have cultural significance.
They have been used as a powerful tool
in the effort to control women's sexuality
in about every culture,
religion and historical decade.
Women are still mistrusted,
shamed,
harmed
and, in the worst cases,
subjected to honor killings
if they don't bleed
on their wedding night.
Other women are forced
through degrading virginity checks,
simply to obtain a job,
to save their reputation
or to get married.
ESD: Like in Indonesia,
where women are systematically examined
to enter military service.
After the Egyptian uprisings in 2011,
a group of female protesters were forced
to undergo virginity checks
by their military.
In Oslo, doctors are examining
the hymens of young girls
to reassure parents
that their children are not ruined.
And sadly, the list goes on.
Women are so afraid not to live up to
the myths about the hymen
that they choose to use
different virginity quick fixes
to assure a bleeding.
That could be plastic surgery,
known as "revirgination,"
it could be vials of blood
poured on the sheets after sex
or fake hymens bought online,
complete with theater blood
and a promise to "kiss your deep,
dark secret goodbye."
NDB: By telling girls
that no deed can be kept secret,
that their bodies
will reveal them no matter what,
we have endowed them with fear.
Girls are afraid of ruining themselves,
either through sport,
play,
tampon use
or a sexual activity.
We have curtailed their opportunities
and their freedoms.
It's time we put an end
to the virginity fraud.
It's time we break the myths
about the hymen
once and for all.
ESD: We are medical students,
sexual health workers
and the authors
of "The Wonder Down Under."
(Laughter)
That's a popular science book
about the female genitals.
And in our experience,
people seem to believe
that the hymen is some kind of a seal
covering the vaginal opening.
In Norwegian, it is even called
"the virgin membrane."
And with this,
we picture something fragile,
something easily destructible,
something you can rip through,
perhaps like a sheet of plastic wrapping.
You may have wondered
why we brought a hula hoop onstage today.
We'll show you.
(Laughter)
Now, it is very hard to hide
that something has happened
to this hoop, right?
It is different
before and after I punched it.
The seal is broken,
and unless we change the plastic,
it won't get back to its intact state.
So if we wanted to do a virginity check
on this hoop right here,
right now,
that would be very easy.
It's easy to say that this hoop
is not a virgin anymore.
(Laughter)
NDB: But the hymen
is nothing like a piece of plastic
you can wrap around your food,
or a seal.
In fact ...
it's more like this --
a scrunchie or a rubber band.
The hymen is a rim of tissue
at the outer opening of the vagina.
And usually, it has a doughnut
or a half-moon shape
with a large, central hole.
But this varies a lot,
and sometimes hymens can have fringes,
it can have several holes,
or it can consist of lobes.
In other words, hymens
naturally vary a lot in looks,
and that is what makes it so hard
to do a virginity check.
ESD: Now that we know a bit more
about the hymen's anatomy,
it's time to get back to our two myths:
virgins bleed,
hymens are lost forever.
But the hymen doesn't
have to break at all.
The hymen is like a scrunchie
in function as well as in looks.
And you can stretch a scrunchie, right?
(Laughter)
You can stretch a hymen, too.
In fact, it's very elastic.
And for a lot of women,
the hymen will be elastic enough
to handle a vaginal intercourse
without sustaining any damage.
For other women, the hymen may tear a bit
to make room for the penis,
but that won't make it disappear.
But it may look
a bit different from before.
It naturally follows
that you can't examine the hymen
to check for virginity status.
This was noted over 100 years ago in 1906
by the Norwegian doctor Marie Jeancet.
She examined a middle-aged sex worker
and concluded that her genitalia
were reminiscent of a teenage virgin.
But that makes sense, right?
Because if her hymen
was never damaged during sex,
then what were we expecting to see?
ESD: Since hymens come
in every shape and form,
it is difficult to know
if a dent or a fold in it is there
because of previous damage
or if it's just a normal
anatomical variant.
The absurdity of virgin testing
is illustrated in a study
done on 36 pregnant teenagers.
When doctors examined their hymens,
they could only find
clear signs of penetration
in two out of the 36 girls.
So unless you believe
in 34 cases of virgin births --
(Laughter)
we must all agree
that also our second myth
has taken a vital blow.
You simply cannot look a woman
between her legs
and read her sexual story.
NDB: Like most myths,
the myths about the hymen are untrue.
There is no virgin seal
that magically disappears after sex,
and half of virgins
can easily have sex without bleeding.
We wish we could say
that by removing these myths,
everything would be OK,
that shame, harm and honor killings
would all just disappear.
But of course, it's not that simple.
Sexual oppression of women
comes from something much deeper
than a simple anatomical misunderstanding
about the properties of the hymen.
It's a question of cultural and religious
control of women's sexuality.
And that is much harder to change.
But we must try.
ESD: As medical professionals,
this is our contribution.
We want every girl, parent
and [future] husband to know
what the hymen is and how it works.
We want them to know
that the hymen can't be used
as a proof of virginity.
And that way, we can remove
one of the most powerful tools
used to control young women today.
After telling you this,
you may wonder what the alternative is,
for if we cannot use the hymen
as a proof of virginity for women,
then what should we use?
We opt for using nothing.
(Cheering)
If you --
(Applause)
If you really want to know
if a woman is a virgin or not,
ask her.
(Laughter)
But how she answers
that question is her choice.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Tell your daughters of this year,
how we woke needing coffee
but discovered instead cadavers
strewn about our morning papers,
waterlogged facsimiles
of our sisters, spouses, small children.
Say to your baby of this year
when she asks, as she certainly should,
tell her it was too late coming.
Admit even in the year we leased freedom,
we didn't own it outright.
There were still laws
for every way we used our privates
while they pawed at the soft folds of us,
grabbed with no concern for consent,
no laws made for the men
that enforced them.
We were trained to dodge,
to wait, to cower and cover,
to wait more, still, wait.
We were told to be silent.
But speak to your girls of this wartime,
a year preceded by a score of the same,
so as in two decades before,
we wiped our eyes,
laced caskets with flags,
evacuated the crime scene of the club,
caterwauled in the street,
laid our bodies on the concrete
against the outlines of our fallen,
cried, "Of course we mattered,"
chanted for our disappeared.
The women wept this year.
They did.
In the same year, we were ready.
The year we lost our inhibition
and moved with courageous abandon
was also the year we stared down barrels,
sang of cranes in skies,
ducked and parried,
caught gold in hijab,
collected death threats,
knew ourselves as patriots,
said, "We're 35 now, time we settled down
and found a running mate,"
made road maps for infant joy,
shamed nothing but fear,
called ourselves fat and meant, of course,
impeccable.
This year, we were women,
not brides or trinkets,
not an off-brand gender,
not a concession, but women.
Instruct your babies.
Remind them that the year has passed
to be docile or small.
Some of us said for the first time
that we were women,
took this oath of solidarity seriously.
Some of us bore children
and some of us did not,
and none of us questioned
whether that made us real
or appropriate or true.
When she asks you of this year,
your daughter, whether your offspring
or heir to your triumph,
from her comforted side of history
teetering towards woman,
she will wonder and ask voraciously,
though she cannot fathom your sacrifice,
she will hold your estimation of it holy,
curiously probing, "Where were you?
Did you fight?
Were you fearful or fearsome?
What colored the walls of your regret?
What did you do for women
in the year it was time?
This path you made for me,
which bones had to break?
Did you do enough, and are you OK, momma?
And are you a hero?"
She will ask the difficult questions.
She will not care
about the arc of your brow,
the weight of your clutch.
She will not ask of your mentions.
Your daughter, for whom you have
already carried so much, wants to know
what you brought, what gift,
what light did you keep from extinction?
When they came for victims in the night,
did you sleep through it
or were you roused?
What was the cost of staying woke?
What, in the year we said time's up,
what did you do with your privilege?
Did you sup on others' squalor?
Did you look away
or directly into the flame?
Did you know your skill
or treat it like a liability?
Were you fooled by the epithets
of "nasty" or "less than"?
Did you teach with an open heart
or a clenched fist?
Where were you?
Tell her the truth. Make it your life.
Confirm it. Say, "Daughter, I stood there
with the moment
drawn on my face like a dagger,
and flung it back at itself,
slicing space for you."
Tell her the truth, how you lived
in spite of crooked odds.
Tell her you were brave,
and always, always
in the company of courage,
mostly the days
when you just had yourself.
Tell her she was born as you were,
as your mothers before,
and the sisters beside them,
in the age of legends, like always.
Tell her she was born just in time,
just in time
to lead.
(Applause)
What are you doing on this stage
in front of all these people?
(Laughter)
Run!
(Laughter)
Run now.
That's the voice of my anxiety talking.
Even when there's absolutely
nothing wrong,
I sometimes get
this overwhelming sense of doom,
like danger is lurking
just around the corner.
You see, a few years ago,
I was diagnosed with generalized anxiety
and depression --
two conditions that often go hand in hand.
Now, there was a time
I wouldn't have told anybody,
especially not in front of a big audience.
As a black woman,
I've had to develop
extraordinary resilience to succeed.
And like most people in my community,
I had the misconception that depression
was a sign of weakness,
a character flaw.
But I wasn't weak;
I was a high achiever.
I'd earned a Master's degree
in Media Studies
and had a string of high-profile jobs
in the film and television industries.
I'd even won two Emmy Awards
for my hard work.
Sure, I was totally spent,
I lacked interest in things
I used to enjoy,
barely ate,
struggled with insomnia
and felt isolated and depleted.
But depressed?
No, not me.
It took weeks before I could admit it,
but the doctor was right:
I was depressed.
Still, I didn't tell anybody
about my diagnosis.
I was too ashamed.
I didn't think I had the right
to be depressed.
I had a privileged life
with a loving family
and a successful career.
And when I thought about
the unspeakable horrors
that my ancestors
had been through in this country
so that I could have it better,
my shame grew even deeper.
I was standing on their shoulders.
How could I let them down?
I would hold my head up,
put a smile on my face
and never tell a soul.
On July 4, 2013,
my world came crashing in on me.
That was the day I got
a phone call from my mom
telling me that my 22-year-old nephew,
Paul, had ended his life,
after years of battling
depression and anxiety.
There are no words that can describe
the devastation I felt.
Paul and I were very close,
but I had no idea he was in so much pain.
Neither one of us had ever talked
to the other about our struggles.
The shame and stigma kept us both silent.
Now, my way of dealing with adversity
is to face it head on,
so I spent the next two years
researching depression and anxiety,
and what I found was mind-blowing.
The World Health Organization reports
that depression is the leading cause
of sickness and disability
in the world.
While the exact cause
of depression isn't clear,
research suggests
that most mental disorders develop,
at least in part,
because of a chemical
imbalance in the brain,
and/or an underlying
genetic predisposition.
So you can't just shake it off.
For black Americans,
stressors like racism
and socioeconomic disparities
put them at a 20 percent greater risk
of developing a mental disorder,
yet they seek mental health services
at about half the rate of white Americans.
One reason is the stigma,
with 63 percent of black Americans
mistaking depression for a weakness.
Sadly, the suicide rate
among black children
has doubled in the past 20 years.
Now, here's the good news:
seventy percent of people
struggling with depression will improve
with therapy, treatment and medication.
Armed with this information,
I made a decision:
I wasn't going to be silent anymore.
With my family's blessing,
I would share our story
in hopes of sparking
a national conversation.
A friend, Kelly Pierre-Louis, said,
"Being strong is killing us."
She's right.
We have got to retire
those tired, old narratives
of the strong black woman
and the super-masculine black man,
who, no matter how many times
they get knocked down,
just shake it off and soldier on.
Having feelings isn't a sign of weakness.
Feelings mean we're human.
And when we deny our humanity,
it leaves us feeling empty inside,
searching for ways to self-medicate
in order to fill the void.
My drug was high achievement.
These days, I share my story openly,
and I ask others to share theirs, too.
I believe that's what it takes
to help people who may
be suffering in silence
to know that they are not alone
and to know that with help,
they can heal.
Now, I still have my struggles,
particularly with the anxiety,
but I'm able to manage it
through daily mediation,
yoga and a relatively healthy diet.
(Laughter)
If I feel like things
are starting to spiral,
I make an appointment to see my therapist,
a dynamic black woman
named Dawn Armstrong,
who has a great sense of humor
and a familiarity that I find comforting.
I will always regret
that I couldn't be there for my nephew.
But my sincerest hope
is that I can inspire others
with the lesson that I've learned.
Life is beautiful.
Sometimes it's messy,
and it's always unpredictable.
But it will all be OK
when you have your support system
to help you through it.
I hope that if your burden gets too heavy,
you'll ask for a hand, too.
Thank you.
(Applause)
I'm used to thinking of the TED audience
as a wonderful collection
of some of the most effective,
intelligent, intellectual, savvy,
worldly and innovative
people in the world.
And I think that's true.
However, I also have reason to believe
that many, if not most, of you
are actually tying your shoes incorrectly.
(Laughter)
Now I know that seems ludicrous.
I know that seems ludicrous.
And believe me, I lived the same sad life
until about three years ago.
And what happened to me
was I bought, what was for me,
a very expensive pair of shoes.
But those shoes came
with round nylon laces,
and I couldn't keep them tied.
So I went back to the store
and said to the owner,
"I love the shoes, but I hate the laces."
He took a look and said,
"Oh, you're tying them wrong."
Now up until that moment,
I would have thought that, by age 50,
one of the life skills
that I had really nailed
was tying my shoes.
(Laughter)
But not so -- let me demonstrate.
This is the way
that most of us
were taught to tie our shoes.
Now as it turns out -- thank you.
(Applause)
Wait, there's more.
As it turns out --
(Laughter)
there's a strong form
and a weak form of this knot,
and we were taught the weak form.
And here's how to tell.
If you pull the strands
at the base of the knot,
you will see that the bow
will orient itself
down the long axis of the shoe.
That's the weak form of the knot.
But not to worry.
If we start over
and simply go the other direction
around the bow,
we get this, the strong form of the knot.
And if you pull the cords under the knot,
you will see that the bow orients itself
along the transverse axis of the shoe.
This is a stronger knot.
It will come untied less often.
It will let you down less,
and not only that, it looks better.
We're going to do this one more time.
(Applause)
Start as usual --
(Applause)
go the other way around the loop.
This is a little hard for children,
but I think you can handle it.
Pull the knot.
There it is: the strong form
of the shoe knot.
Now, in keeping with today's theme,
I'd like to point out --
something you already know --
that sometimes a small advantage
someplace in life
can yield tremendous results
someplace else.
(Laughter)
Live long and prosper.
(Applause)
Leah Chase: Oh, this is beautiful.
Oh, gosh, I never saw such a room
and beauty and strength
like I'm looking at.
That's gorgeous. It is.
It is a beautiful room.
Pat Mitchell: I almost said your age,
because you gave me permission,
but I realized that I was
about to make you a year older.
You're only 94.
(Laughter)
(Applause)
LC: Yeah, I'm only 94.
(Applause)
I mean, you get this old
and parts start wearing out.
Your legs start wearing out.
The one thing that my children always say:
"But nothing happened to your mouth."
(Laughter)
So you've got to have something going,
so I've got my mouth going.
(Laughter)
PM: So Mrs. Chase,
the first time we were there,
I brought a group of young women,
who work with us at TED,
into the kitchen,
and we were all standing around
and you had already cooked lunch
for hundreds of people,
as you do every day,
and you looked up at them.
You have to share with this audience
what you said to those young women.
LC: Well, you know,
I talk to young women all the time,
and it's beginning to bother me,
because look how far I came.
I'd come with women
that had to really hustle and work hard,
and they knew how to be women.
They didn't play that man down.
And, well, we didn't have
the education you have today,
and God, I'm so proud
when I see those women
with all that education under their belt.
That's why I worked hard,
tried to get everybody
to use those resources.
So they just don't know their power,
and I always tell them,
just look at my mother,
had 12 girls before she had a boy.
(Laughter)
So you know how I came out.
(Laughter)
Now, she had 14 children.
She raised 11 of us out of that 14,
and up until last year,
we were all still living,
a bunch of old biddies,
but we're still here.
(Laughter)
And sometimes we can be just cantankerous
and blah blah blah blah blah,
but we still go.
And I love to see women.
You don't know what it does for me
to see women in the position
that you're in today.
I never thought I'd see that.
I never thought I'd see women
be able to take places
and positions that we have today.
It is just a powerful thing.
I had a young woman come to me.
She was an African-American woman.
And I said, "Well, what do you do, honey?"
She said, "I am a retired Navy pilot."
Oh God, that just melted me,
because I knew how hard it was
to integrate that Navy.
You know, the Navy was the last thing
to really be integrated,
and that was done by Franklin Roosevelt
as a favor to an African-American man,
Lester Granger, that I knew very well.
He was the head of the National
Urban League back there,
and when Roosevelt asked him,
he wanted to appoint Lester
as maybe one of his cabinet members.
Lester said, "No, I don't want that.
All I want you to do
is integrate that Navy."
And that was what Franklin did.
Well, Franklin didn't live to do it,
but Truman did it.
But when this woman told me,
"I have flown everything there is to fly,"
bombers, just all kinds of planes,
it just melted me, you know,
just to see how far women have come.
And I told her, I said,
"Well, you could get
into the space program."
She said, "But Ms. Chase, I'm too old."
She was already 60-some years old,
and, you know, you're over the hill then.
(Laughter)
They don't want you flying
up in the sky at 60-something years old.
Stay on the ground.
When I meet women,
and today everybody comes to my kitchen,
and you know that,
and it upsets Stella, my daughter.
She doesn't like people
coming in the kitchen.
But that's where I am,
and that's where you're going
to see me, in the kitchen.
So when they come there,
I meet all kinds of people.
And that is the thing
that really uplifts me,
is when I meet women on the move.
When I meet women on the move,
it is good for me.
Now, I'm not one of these
flag-waving women.
You're not going to see me
out there waving.
No, I don't do that.
(Laughter)
No, I don't do that, and I don't want
any of you to do that.
Just be good women.
And you know, my mother taught us ...
she was tough on us,
and she said, "You know, Leah,"
she gave us all this plaque,
"to be a good woman,
you have to first look like a girl."
Well, I thought I looked like a girl.
"Act like a lady."
That, I never learned to do.
(Laughter)
"Think like a man."
Now don't act like that man;
think like a man.
And "work like a dog."
(Laughter)
So we learned that the hard way.
And they taught you that.
They taught you what women had to do.
We were taught that women
controlled the behavior of men.
How you act, they will act.
So you've got to do that,
and I tell you all the time.
You know, don't play this man down.
It upsets me when you may have a husband
that maybe he doesn't have as much
education under his belt as you have,
but still you can't play him down.
You've got to keep lifting him up,
because you don't want
to live with a mouse.
So you want that man to be a man,
and do what he has to do.
And anyway, always remember,
he runs on cheap gas.
(Laughter)
So fill him up with cheap gas --
(Laughter)
and then, you got him.
It's just so --
(Laughter)
It's just --
PM: You have to give us
a minute to take that in.
(Laughter)
LC: When I heard this young lady
speak before I came out --
she was so beautiful,
and I wished I could be like that,
and my husband, poor darling --
I lost him after
we were married 70 years --
didn't agree on one thing,
never did, nothing,
but we got along together
because he learned to understand me,
and that was just hard,
because he was so different.
And that lady reminded me.
I said, "If I would have
just been like her,
Dooky would have really loved it."
(Laughter)
But I wasn't.
I was always pushy, always moving,
always doing this,
and he used to come to me
all the time, and he said,
"Honey, God's going to punish you."
(Laughter)
"You -- you're just not grateful."
But it isn't that I'm not grateful,
but I think, as long as you're living,
you've got to keep moving,
you've got to keep trying to get up
and do what you've got to do.
(Applause)
You cannot sit down.
You have to keep going,
keep trying to do a little bit every day.
Every day, you do a little bit,
try to make it better.
And that's been my whole life.
Well, I came up
in the country, small town,
had to do everything,
had to haul the water,
had to wash the clothes, do this, do that,
pick the dumb strawberries,
all that kind of stuff.
(Laughter)
But still, my daddy insisted
that we act nice,
we be kind.
And that's all.
When I heard this young woman --
oh, she sounds so beautiful --
I said, "I wish I could be like that."
PM: Mrs. Chase, we don't want you
to be any different than you are.
There is no question about that.
Let me ask you.
This is why it's so wonderful
to have a conversation
with someone who has such a long view --
LC: A long time.
PM: to remembering Roosevelt
and the person he did that favor for.
What is in your head and your mind
and what you have seen and witnessed ...
One of the things that it's good
to remember, always,
is that when you opened that restaurant,
whites and blacks could not
eat together in this city.
It was against the law.
And yet they did, at Dooky Chase.
Tell me about that.
LC: They did, there.
Well, my mother-in-law first started this,
and the reason she started is,
because her husband was sickly,
and he would go out --
and people from Chicago
and all the places,
you would call his job a numbers runner.
But in New Orleans,
we are very sophisticated --
(Laughter)
so it wasn't a numbers runner,
it was a lottery vendor.
(Laughter)
So you see, we put class to that.
But that's how he did it.
And he couldn't go from house to house
to get his clients and all that,
because he was sick,
so she opened up
this little sandwich shop,
so she was going to take down the numbers,
because he was sick a lot.
He had ulcers. He was really bad
for a long a time.
So she did that --
and not knowing anything,
but she knew she could make a sandwich.
She knew she could cook,
and she borrowed 600 dollars
from a brewery.
Can you imagine starting
a business today with 600 dollars
and no knowledge of what you're doing?
And it always just amazed me
what she could do.
She was a good money manager.
That, I am not.
My husband used to call me
a bankrupt sister.
(Laughter)
"She'll spend everything you got."
And I would, you know.
PM: But you kept
the restaurant open, though,
even in those times of controversy,
when people were protesting
and almost boycotting.
I mean, it was a controversial move
that you and your husband made.
LC: It was, and I don't
know how we did it,
but as I said, my mother-in-law
was a kind, kind person,
and you didn't have any African-Americans
on the police force at that time.
They were all white.
But they would come around,
and she would say,
"Bebe, I'm gonna fix you
a little sandwich."
So she would fix them a sandwich.
Today they would call that bribery.
(Laughter)
But she was just that kind of person.
She liked to do things for you.
She liked to give.
So she would do that,
and maybe that helped us out,
because nobody ever bothered us.
We had Jim Dombrowski, Albert Ben Smith,
who started all kinds of things
right in that restaurant,
and nobody ever bothered us.
So we just did it.
PM: Excuse me.
You talked to me that day
about the fact that people considered
the restaurant a safe haven
where they could come together,
particularly if they were working
on civil rights,
human rights,
working to change the laws.
LC: Well, because once
you got inside those doors,
nobody ever, ever bothered you.
The police would never come in
and bother our customers, never.
So they felt safe to come there.
They could eat, they could plan.
All the Freedom Riders,
that's where they planned
all their meetings.
They would come and we would
serve them a bowl of gumbo
and fried chicken.
(Laughter)
So I said, we'd changed
the course of America
over a bowl of gumbo
and some fried chicken.
(Applause)
I would like to invite the leaders, now,
just come have a bowl of gumbo
and some fried chicken,
talk it over and we'd go
and we'd do what we have to do.
(Applause)
And that's all we did.
PM: Could we send you a list
to invite to lunch?
(Laughter)
LC: Yeah, invite.
Because that's what we're not doing.
We're not talking.
Come together.
I don't care if you're a Republican
or what you are -- come together.
Talk.
And I know those old guys.
I was friends with those old guys,
like Tip O'Neill and all of those people.
They knew how to come together and talk,
and you would disagree maybe.
That's OK.
But you would talk, and we would come
to a good thing and meet.
And so that's what we did
in that restaurant.
They would plan the meeting,
Oretha's mother, Oretha Haley's mother.
She was big in CORE.
Her mother worked for me for 42 years.
And she was like me.
We didn't understand the program.
Nobody our age understood this program,
and we sure didn't want
our children to go to jail.
Oh, that was ... oh God.
But these young people
were willing to go to jail
for what they believed.
We were working with Thurgood
and A.P. Tureaud and all those people
with the NAACP.
But that was a slow move.
We would still be out here trying
to get in the door, waiting for them.
(Laughter)
PM: Is that Thurgood Marshall
you're talking about?
LC: Thurgood Marshall.
But I loved Thurgood.
He was a good movement.
They wanted to do this
without offending anybody.
I'll never forget A.P. Tureaud:
"But you can't offend the white people.
Don't offend them."
But these young people didn't care.
They said, "We're going.
Ready or not, we're going to do this."
And so we had to support them.
These were the children we knew,
righteous children.
We had to help them.
PM: And they brought the change.
LC: And they brought the change.
You know, it was hard,
but sometimes you do
hard things to make changes.
PM: And you've seen
so many of those changes.
The restaurant has been a bridge.
You have been a bridge
between the past and now,
but you don't live in the past, do you?
You live very much in the present.
LC: And that's what you have to tell
young people today.
OK, you can protest,
but put the past behind you.
I can't make you responsible
for what your grandfather did.
That's your grandfather.
I have to build on that.
I have to make changes.
I can't stay there and say,
"Oh, well, look what they did to us then.
Look what they do to us now."
No, you remember that,
but that makes you keep going on,
but you don't harp on it every day.
You move,
and you move to make a difference,
and everybody should be involved.
My children said,
"Mother, don't get political," you know.
(Laughter)
"Don't get political, because you know
we don't like that."
But you have to be political today.
You have to be involved.
Be a part of the system.
Look how it was when we couldn't be
a part of the system.
When Dutch Morial became the mayor,
it was a different feeling
in the African-American community.
We felt a part of things.
Now we've got a mayor.
We feel like we belong.
Moon tried before Dutch came.
PM: Mayor Landrieu's father,
Moon Landrieu.
LC: Mayor Landrieu's father,
he took great, great risks
by putting African-Americans in city hall.
He took a whipping for that
for a long time,
but he was a visionary,
and he did those things that he knew
was going to help the city.
He knew we had to get involved.
So that's what we have to do.
We don't harp on that.
We just keep moving,
and Mitch, you know,
I tell Moon all the time,
"You did a good thing,"
but Mitch did one bigger than you
and better than you.
When he pulled those statues down,
I said, "Boy, you're crazy!"
(Applause)
You're crazy.
But it was a good political move.
You know, when I saw
P.T. Beauregard come down,
I was sitting looking at the news,
and it just hit me
what this was all about.
To me, it wasn't about race;
it was a political move.
And I got so furious,
I got back on that kitchen
the next morning,
and I said, come on, pick up
your pants, and let's go to work,
because you're going to get left behind.
And that's what you have to do.
You have to move on people,
move on what they do.
It was going to bring
visibility to the city.
So you got that visibility --
move on it, uplift yourself,
do what you have to do,
and do it well.
And that's all we do.
That's all I try to do.
PM: But you just gave
the formula for resilience. Right?
So you are clearly the best example
we could find anywhere of resilience,
so there must be something you think --
LC: I like emotional strength.
I like people with emotional
and physical strength,
and maybe that's bad for me.
My favorite all-time general
was George Patton.
You know, that wasn't too cool.
(Laughter)
PM: It's surprising.
LC: I've got George Patton
hanging in my dining room
because I want to remember.
He set goals for himself,
and he was going to set out
to reach those goals.
He never stopped.
And I always remember his words:
"Lead, follow, or get out of the way."
Now, I can't lead --
(Applause)
I can't be a leader,
but I can follow a good leader,
but I am not getting out of the way.
(Applause)
But that's just what you have to do.
(Applause)
If you can't lead --
leaders need followers,
so if I help you up there,
I'm going to ride on your coattails,
and I can't count
the coattails I've ridden upon.
(Laughter)
Feed you good. You'll help me out.
(Laughter)
And that's what life is all about.
Everybody can do something,
but please get involved.
Do something.
The thing we have to do
in this city, in all cities --
mommas have to start being mommas today.
You know?
They have to start understanding --
when you bring this child in the world,
you have to make a man out of it,
you have to make a woman out of it,
and it takes some doing.
It takes sacrifice.
Maybe you won't have the long fingernails,
maybe you won't have the pretty hair.
But that child will be on the move,
and that's what you have to do.
We have to concentrate on educating
and making these children understand
what it's all about.
And I hate to tell you, gentlemen,
it's going to take
a good woman to do that.
It's going to take
a good woman to do that.
(Applause)
Men can do their part.
The other part is to just do
what you have to do
and bring it home,
but we can handle the rest,
and we will handle the rest.
If you're a good woman, you can do that.
PM: You heard that first here.
We can handle the rest.
LC: We can handle the rest.
Mrs. Chase, thank you so much --
LC: Thank you.
PM: for taking time out from the work
you do every day in this community.
LC: But you don't know
what this does for me.
When I see all of these people,
and come together --
people come to my kitchen
from all over the world.
I had people come from London,
now twice this happened to me.
First a man came, and I don't know
why he came to this --
Every year, the chefs do something
called "Chef's Charity."
Well, it so happened
I was the only woman there,
and the only African-American there
on that stage doing these demonstrations,
and I would not leave until I saw
another woman come up there, too.
I'm not going up -- they're going
to carry me up there
until you bring another woman up here.
(Laughter)
So they have another one now,
so I could step down.
But this man was from London.
So after that, I found the man
in my kitchen.
He came to my kitchen,
and he said, "I want
to ask you one question."
OK, I thought I was going to ask
something about food.
"Why do all these white men
hang around you?"
(Laughter)
What?
(Laughter)
I couldn't understand.
He couldn't understand that.
I said, "We work together.
This is the way we live in this city.
I may never go to your house,
you may never come to my house.
But when it comes to working,
like raising money
for this special school,
we come together.
That's what we do.
And still here comes another, a woman,
elegantly dressed,
about a month ago in my kitchen.
She said, "I don't understand
what I see in your dining room."
I said, "What do you see?"
She saw whites and blacks together.
That's what we do.
We meet. We talk.
And we work together,
and that's what we have to do.
You don't have to be my best friend
to work to better your city,
to better your country.
We just have to come together and work,
and that's what we do in this city.
We're a weird bunch down here.
(Laughter)
Nobody understands us,
but we feed you well.
(Laughter)
(Applause)
(Cheering)
Thank you.
(Applause)
This is a map of New York State
that was made in 1937
by the General Drafting Company.
It's an extremely famous map
among cartography nerds,
because down here at the bottom
of the Catskill Mountains,
there is a little town called Roscoe --
actually, this will go easier
if I just put it up here --
There's Roscoe, and then right
above Roscoe is Rockland, New York,
and then right above that
is the tiny town of Agloe, New York.
Agloe, New York, is very famous
to cartographers,
because it's a paper town.
It's also known as a copyright trap.
Mapmakers -- because my map of New York
and your map of New York
are going to look very similar,
on account of the shape of New York --
often, mapmakers will insert
fake places onto their maps,
in order to protect their copyright.
Because then, if my fake place
shows up on your map,
I can be well and truly sure
that you have robbed me.
Agloe is a scrabblization of the initials
of the two guys who made this map,
Ernest Alpers and Otto [G.] Lindberg,
and they released this map in 1937.
Decades later, Rand McNally releases a map
with Agloe, New York, on it,
at the same exact intersection
of two dirt roads
in the middle of nowhere.
Well, you can imagine the delight
over at General Drafting.
They immediately call
Rand McNally, and they say,
"We've caught you!
We made Agloe, New York, up.
It is a fake place. It's a paper town.
We're going to sue your pants off!"
And Rand McNally says,
"No, no, no, no, Agloe is real."
Because people kept going
to that intersection of two dirt roads --
(Laughter)
in the middle of nowhere, expecting
there to be a place called Agloe --
someone built a place
called Agloe, New York.
(Laughter)
It had a gas station, a general store,
two houses at its peak.
(Laughter)
And this is of course a completely
irresistible metaphor to a novelist,
because we would all like to believe
that the stuff that we write down on paper
can change the actual world
in which we're actually living,
which is why my third book
is called "Paper Towns".
But what interests me ultimately more
than the medium in which this happened,
is the phenomenon itself.
It's easy enough to say that the world
shapes our maps of the world, right?
Like the overall shape of the world
is obviously going to affect our maps.
But what I find a lot more
interesting is the way
that the manner in which we map
the world changes the world.
Because the world would truly be
a different place if North were down.
And the world would be
a truly different place
if Alaska and Russia weren't
on opposite sides of the map.
And the world would be a different place
if we projected Europe
to show it in its actual size.
The world is changed
by our maps of the world.
The way that we choose -- sort of,
our personal cartographic enterprise,
also shapes the map of our lives,
and that in turn shapes our lives.
I believe that what we map
changes the life we lead.
And I don't mean that in some, like,
secret-y Oprah's Angels network, like,
you-can-think-your-way-
out-of-cancer sense.
But I do believe that while maps don't
show you where you will go in your life,
they show you where you might go.
You very rarely go to a place
that isn't on your personal map.
So I was a really terrible student
when I was a kid.
My GPA was consistently in the low 2s.
And I think the reason that I was
such a terrible student
is that I felt like education
was just a series of hurdles
that had been erected before me,
and I had to jump over
in order to achieve adulthood.
And I didn't really want
to jump over these hurdles,
because they seemed completely
arbitrary, so I often wouldn't,
and then people would
threaten me, you know,
they'd threaten me with this
"going on [my] permanent record,"
or "You'll never get a good job."
I didn't want a good job!
As far as I could tell at eleven
or twelve years old,
like, people with good jobs woke up
very early in the morning,
(Laughter)
and the men who had good jobs,
one of the first things they did
was tie a strangulation item
of clothing around their necks.
They literally put nooses on themselves,
and then they went off to their jobs,
whatever they were.
That's not a recipe for a happy life.
These people -- in my, symbol-obsessed,
twelve year-old imagination --
these people who are strangling themselves
as one of the first things
they do each morning,
they can't possibly be happy.
Why would I want to jump
over all of these hurdles
and have that be the end?
That's a terrible end!
And then, when I was in tenth grade,
I went to this school,
Indian Springs School,
a small boarding school,
outside of Birmingham, Alabama.
And all at once I became a learner.
And I became a learner,
because I found myself
in a community of learners.
I found myself surrounded by people
who celebrated intellectualism
and engagement,
and who thought that my ironic
oh-so-cool disengagement
wasn't clever, or funny,
but, like, it was a simple
and unspectacular response
to very complicated
and compelling problems.
And so I started to learn,
because learning was cool.
I learned that some infinite sets
are bigger than other infinite sets,
and I learned that iambic pentameter is
and why it sounds so good to human ears.
I learned that the Civil War
was a nationalizing conflict,
I learned some physics,
I learned that correlation shouldn't be
confused with causation --
all of these things, by the way,
enriched my life
on a literally daily basis.
And it's true that I don't use
most of them for my "job,"
but that's not what it's about for me.
It's about cartography.
What is the process of cartography?
It's, you know, sailing
upon some land, and thinking,
"I think I'll draw that bit of land,"
and then wondering, "Maybe there's
some more land to draw."
And that's when learning
really began for me.
It's true that I had teachers
that didn't give up on me,
and I was very fortunate
to have those teachers,
because I often gave them cause to think
there was no reason to invest in me.
But a lot of the learning
that I did in high school
wasn't about what happened
inside the classroom,
it was about what happened
outside of the classroom.
For instance, I can tell you
that "There's a certain Slant of light,
Winter Afternoons --
That oppresses, like the Heft
Of Cathedral Tunes --"
not because I memorized
Emily Dickinson in school
when I was in high school,
but because there was a girl
when I was in high school,
and her name was Amanda,
and I had a crush on her,
and she liked Emily Dickinson poetry.
The reason I can tell you
what opportunity cost is,
is because one day when I was playing
Super Mario Kart on my couch,
my friend Emmet walked in, and he said,
"How long have you been playing
Super Mario Kart?"
And I said, "I don't know,
like, six hours?" and he said,
"Do you realize that if you'd worked
at Baskin-Robbins those six hours,
you could have made 30 dollars,
so in some ways,
you just paid thirty dollars
to play Super Mario Kart."
And I was, like, "I'll take that deal."
(Laughter)
But I learned what opportunity cost is.
And along the way, the map
of my life got better.
It got bigger; it contained more places.
There were more things that might happen,
more futures I might have.
It wasn't a formal, organized
learning process,
and I'm happy to admit that.
It was spotty, it was inconsistent,
there was a lot I didn't know.
I might know, you know, Cantor's idea
that some infinite sets are larger
than other infinite sets,
but I didn't really understand
the calculus behind that idea.
I might know the idea of opportunity cost,
but I didn't know the law
of diminishing returns.
But the great thing about imagining
learning as cartography,
instead of imagining it
as arbitrary hurdles
that you have to jump over,
is that you see a bit of coastline,
and that makes you want to see more.
And so now I do know
at least some of the calculus
that underlies all of that stuff.
So, I had one learning community
in high school, then I went
to another for college,
and then I went to another,
when I started working
at a magazine called "Booklist,"
where I was an assistant, surrounded
by astonishingly well-read people.
And then I wrote a book.
And like all authors dream of doing,
I promptly quit my job.
(Laughter)
And for the first time since high school,
I found myself without a learning
community, and it was miserable.
I hated it.
I read many, many books
during this two-year period.
I read books about Stalin,
and books about how the Uzbek people
came to identify as Muslims,
and I read books about
how to make atomic bombs,
but it just felt like I was
creating my own hurdles,
and then jumping over them myself,
instead of feeling the excitement
of being part of a community of learners,
a community of people
who are engaged together
in the cartographic enterprise
of trying to better understand
and map the world around us.
And then, in 2006, I met that guy.
His name is Ze Frank.
I didn't actually meet him,
just on the Internet.
Ze Frank was running, at the time,
a show called "The Show with Ze Frank,"
and I discovered the show,
and that was my way back
into being a community learner again.
Here's Ze talking about Las Vegas:
(Video) Ze Frank: Las Vegas was built
in the middle of a huge, hot desert.
Almost everything here was brought
from somewhere else --
the sort of rocks, the trees,
the waterfalls.
These fish are almost as out of place
as my pig that flew.
Contrasted to the scorching desert
that surrounds this place,
so are these people.
Things from all over the world have been
rebuilt here, away from their histories,
and away from the people
that experience them differently.
Sometimes improvements were made --
even the Sphinx got a nose job.
Here, there's no reason to feel
like you're missing anything.
This New York means the same to me
as it does to everyone else.
Everything is out of context, and that
means context allows for everything:
Self Parking, Events Center, Shark Reef.
This fabrication of place could be one
of the world's greatest achievements,
because no one belongs here;
everyone does.
As I walked around this morning,
I noticed most of the buildings
were huge mirrors reflecting
the sun back into the desert.
But unlike most mirrors,
which present you with an outside view
of yourself embedded in a place,
these mirrors come back empty.
John Green: Makes me
nostalgic for the days
when you could see
the pixels in online video.
(Laughter)
Ze isn't just a great public intellectual,
he's also a brilliant community builder,
and the community of people
that built up around these videos
was in many ways a community of learners.
So we played Ze Frank at chess
collaboratively, and we beat him.
We organized ourselves to take a young man
on a road trip across the United States.
We turned the Earth into a sandwich,
by having one person hold a piece of bread
at one point on the Earth,
and on the exact opposite
point of the Earth,
have another person
holding a piece of bread.
I realize that these are silly ideas,
but they are also "learny" ideas,
and that was what was so exciting to me,
and if you go online, you can find
communities like this all over the place.
Follow the calculus tag on Tumblr,
and yes, you will see people
complaining about calculus,
but you'll also see people
re-blogging those complaints,
making the argument that calculus
is interesting and beautiful,
and here's a way in to thinking about
the problem that you find unsolvable.
You can go to places like Reddit,
and find sub-Reddits,
like "Ask a Historian" or "Ask Science,"
where you can ask people
who are in these fields
a wide range of questions,
from very serious ones to very silly ones.
But to me, the most interesting
communities of learners
that are growing up on the Internet
right now are on YouTube,
and admittedly, I am biased.
But I think in a lot of ways,
the YouTube page resembles a classroom.
Look for instance at "Minute Physics,"
a guy who's teaching
the world about physics:
(Video) Let's cut to the chase.
As of July 4, 2012, the Higgs boson
is the last fundamental piece
of the standard model of particle physics
to be discovered experimentally.
But, you might ask,
why was the Higgs boson
included in the standard model,
alongside well-known particles
like electrons and photons and quarks,
if it hadn't been discovered
back then in the 1970s?
Good question. There are two main reasons.
First, just like the electron
is an excitation in the electron field,
the Higgs boson is simply a particle
which is an excitation
of the everywhere-permeating Higgs field.
The Higgs field in turn
plays an integral role
in our model for the weak nuclear force.
In particular, the Higgs field
helps explain why it's so weak.
We'll talk more about this
in a later video,
but even though weak nuclear theory was
confirmed in the 1980s, in the equations,
the Higgs field is so inextricably jumbled
with the weak force, that until now
we've been unable to confirm
its actual and independent existence.
JG: Or here's a video that I made
as part of my show "Crash Course,"
talking about World War I:
(Video) The immediate cause was
of course the assassination in Sarajevo
of the Austrian Archduke Franz Ferdinand,
on June 28, 1914, by a Bosnian-Serb
nationalist named Gavrilo Princip.
Quick aside: It's worth noting
that the first big war
of the twentieth century began
with an act of terrorism.
So Franz Ferdinand
wasn't particularly well-liked
by his uncle, the emperor Franz Joseph --
now that is a mustache!
But even so, the assassination led Austria
to issue an ultimatum to Serbia,
whereupon Serbia accepted some,
but not all, of Austria's demands,
leading Austria to declare
war against Serbia.
And then Russia, due to its alliance
with the Serbs, mobilized its army.
Germany, because it had
an alliance with Austria,
told Russia to stop mobilizing,
which Russia failed to do, so then Germany
mobilized its own army,
declared war on Russia,
cemented an alliance with the Ottomans,
and then declared war on France,
because, you know, France.
(Laughter)
And it's not just physics
and world history
that people are choosing
to learn through YouTube.
Here's a video about abstract mathematics.
(Video) So you're me, and you're
in math class yet again,
because they make you go every single day.
And you're learning about, I don't know,
the sums of infinite series.
That's a high school topic, right?
Which is odd, because it's a cool topic,
but they somehow manage to ruin it anyway.
So I guess that's why they allow
infinite series in the curriculum.
So, in a quite understandable need
for distraction, you're doodling
and thinking more about what
the plural of "series" should be
than about the topic at hand: "serieses,"
"seriese," "seriesen," and "serii?"
Or is it that the singular should be
changed: one "serie," or "serum,"
just like the singular of "sheep"
should be "shoop."
But the whole concept of things
like 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + 1/16 and so on
approaches one, is useful if, say,
you want to draw a line of elephants,
each holding the tail of the next one:
normal elephant, young elephant,
baby elephant, dog-sized elephant,
puppy-sized elephant, all the way
down to Mr. Tusks and beyond.
Which is at least a tiny bit awesome,
because you can get an infinite number
of elephants in a line,
and still have it fit across
a single notebook page.
JG: And lastly, here's Destin,
from "Smarter Every Day,"
talking about the conservation
of angular momentum,
and, since it's YouTube, cats:
(Video) Hey, it's me, Destin.
Welcome back to "Smarter Every Day."
So you've probably observed that cats
almost always land on their feet.
Today's question is: why?
Like most simple questions,
there's a very complex answer.
For instance, let me reword this question:
How does a cat go from feet-up
to feet-down in a falling reference frame,
without violating the conservation
of angular momentum?
(Laughter)
JG: So, here's something all four
of these videos have in common:
They all have more than half
a million views on YouTube.
And those are people watching
not in classrooms,
but because they are part
of the communities of learning
that are being set up by these channels.
And I said earlier that YouTube
is like a classroom to me,
and in many ways it is,
because here is the instructor --
it's like the old-fashioned classroom:
here's the instructor,
and then beneath the instructor
are the students,
and they're all having a conversation.
And I know that YouTube comments
have a very bad reputation
in the world of the Internet,
but in fact, if you go on comments
for these channels,
what you'll find is people engaging
the subject matter,
asking difficult, complicated questions
that are about the subject matter,
and then other people
answering those questions.
And because the YouTube page is set up so
that the page in which I'm talking to you
is on the exact -- the place where I'm
talking to you is on the exact same page
as your comments,
you are participating in a live and real
and active way in the conversation.
And because I'm in comments usually,
I get to participate with you.
And you find this
whether it's world history,
or mathematics, or science,
or whatever it is.
You also see young people using the tools
and the sort of genres of the Internet
in order to create places
for intellectual engagement,
instead of the ironic detachment
that maybe most of us associate with memes
and other Internet conventions --
you know, "Got bored. Invented calculus."
Or, here's Honey Boo Boo
criticizing industrial capitalism:
["Liberal capitalism is not at all
the Good of humanity.
Quite the contrary; it is the vehicle
of savage, destructive nihilism."]
In case you can't see
what she says ... yeah.
I really believe that these spaces,
these communities, have become
for a new generation of learners,
the kind of communities,
the kind of cartographic communities
that I had when I was in high school,
and then again when I was in college.
And as an adult, re-finding
these communities
has re-introduced me
to a community of learners,
and has encouraged me to continue
to be a learner even in my adulthood,
so that I no longer feel like learning
is something reserved for the young.
Vi Hart and "Minute Physics" introduced me
to all kinds of things
that I didn't know before.
And I know that we all hearken back
to the days of the Parisian salon
in the Enlightenment,
or to the Algonquin Round Table, and wish,
"Oh, I wish I could have been
a part of that,
I wish I could have laughed
at Dorothy Parker's jokes."
But I'm here to tell you that these places
exist, they still exist.
They exist in corners of the Internet,
where old men fear to tread.
(Laughter)
And I truly, truly believe that when
we invented Agloe, New York, in the 1960s,
when we made Agloe real,
we were just getting started.
Thank you.
(Applause)
This means, "I'm smiling."
So does that.
This means "mouse."
"Cat."
Here we have a story.
The start of the story, where this means guy,
and that is a ponytail on a passer-by.
Here's where it happens.
These are when.
This is a cassette tape the girl puts into her cassette-tape player.
She wears it every day.
It's not considered vintage --
she just likes certain music to sound a certain way.
Look at her posture; it's remarkable.
That's because she dances.
Now he, the guy, takes all of this in, figuring,
"Honestly, geez, what are my chances?"
(Laughter)
And he could say, "Oh my God!"
or "I heart you!"
"I'm laughing out loud."
"I want to give you a hug."
But he comes up with that, you know.
He tells her, "I'd like to hand-paint your portrait on a coffee mug."
(Laughter)
Put a crab inside it.
Add some water.
Seven different salts.
He means he's got this sudden notion to stand on dry land,
but just panhandle at the ocean.
He says, "You look like a mermaid, but you walk like a waltz."
And the girl goes, "Wha'?"
So, the guy replies, "Yeah, I know, I know.
I think my heartbeat might be the Morse code for inappropriate.
At least, that's how it seems.
I'm like a junior varsity cheerleader sometimes --
for swearing, awkward silences, and very simple rhyme schemes.
Right now, talking to you, I'm not even really a guy.
I'm a monkey --
(Laughter) --
blowing kisses
at a butterfly.
But I'm still suggesting you and I should meet.
First, soon, and then a lot.
I'm thinking the southwest corner of 5th and 42nd at noon tomorrow,
but I'll stay until you show up, ponytail or not.
Hell, ponytail alone.
I don't know what else to tell you.
I got a pencil you can borrow.
You can put it in your phone."
But the girl does not budge, does not smile, does not frown.
She just says, "No thank you."
You know?
[ "i don't need 2 write it down." ]
(Applause)
When I was 11,
I remember waking up one morning to the sound of joy in my house.
My father was listening to BBC News
on his small, gray radio.
There was a big smile on his face which was unusual then,
because the news mostly depressed him.
"The Taliban are gone!" my father shouted.
I didn't know what it meant,
but I could see that my father was very, very happy.
"You can go to a real school now," he said.
A morning that I will never forget.
A real school.
You see, I was six when the Taliban took over Afghanistan
and made it illegal for girls to go to school.
So for the next five years, I dressed as a boy
to escort my older sister, who was no longer allowed
to be outside alone, to a secret school.
It was the only way we both could be educated.
Each day, we took a different route
so that no one would suspect where we were going.
We would cover our books in grocery bags
so it would seem we were just out shopping.
The school was in a house,
more than 100 of us packed in one small living room.
It was cozy in winter but extremely hot in summer.
We all knew we were risking our lives --
the teacher, the students and our parents.
From time to time, the school would suddenly be canceled
for a week because Taliban were suspicious.
We always wondered what they knew about us.
Were we being followed?
Do they know where we live?
We were scared,
but still, school was where we wanted to be.
I was very lucky to grow up in a family
where education was prized and daughters were treasured.
My grandfather was an extraordinary man for his time.
A total maverick from a remote province of Afghanistan,
he insisted that his daughter, my mom,
go to school, and for that he was disowned by his father.
But my educated mother became a teacher.
There she is.
She retired two years ago, only to turn our house
into a school for girls and women in our neighborhood.
And my father -- that's him --
he was the first ever in his family to receive an education.
There was no question that his children
would receive an education, including his daughters,
despite the Taliban, despite the risks.
To him, there was greater risk in not educating his children.
During Taliban years, I remember
there were times I would get so frustrated by our life
and always being scared and not seeing a future.
I would want to quit,
but my father,
he would say,
"Listen, my daughter,
you can lose everything you own in your life.
Your money can be stolen. You can be forced to leave your home during a war.
But the one thing that will always remain with you
is what is here,
and if we have to sell our blood to pay your school fees,
we will.
So do you still not want to continue?"
Today I am 22.
I was raised in a country that has been destroyed
by decades of war.
Fewer than six percent of women my age have made it beyond high school,
and had my family not been so committed to my education,
I would be one of them.
Instead, I stand here a proud graduate of Middlebury College.
(Applause)
When I returned to Afghanistan, my grandfather,
the one exiled from his home for daring to educate his daughters,
was among the first to congratulate me.
He not only brags about my college degree,
but also that I was the first woman,
and that I am the first woman
to drive him through the streets of Kabul.
(Applause)
My family believes in me.
I dream big, but my family dreams even bigger for me.
That's why I am a global ambassador for 10x10,
a global campaign to educate women.
That's why I cofounded SOLA,
the first and perhaps only boarding school
for girls in Afghanistan,
a country where it's still risky for girls to go to school.
The exciting thing is that I see students at my school
with ambition grabbing at opportunity.
And I see their parents and their fathers
who, like my own, advocate for them,
despite and even in the face of daunting opposition.
Like Ahmed. That's not his real name,
and I cannot show you his face,
but Ahmed is the father of one of my students.
Less than a month ago, he and his daughter
were on their way from SOLA to their village,
and they literally missed being killed
by a roadside bomb by minutes.
As he arrived home, the phone rang,
a voice warning him
that if he sent his daughter back to school,
they would try again.
"Kill me now, if you wish," he said,
"but I will not ruin my daughter's future
because of your old and backward ideas."
What I've come to realize about Afghanistan,
and this is something that is often dismissed in the West,
that behind most of us who succeed
is a father who recognizes the value in his daughter
and who sees that her success is his success.
It's not to say that our mothers aren't key in our success.
In fact, they're often the initial and convincing negotiators
of a bright future for their daughters,
but in the context of a society like in Afghanistan,
we must have the support of men.
Under the Taliban, girls who went to school
numbered in the hundreds --
remember, it was illegal.
But today, more than three million girls are in school in Afghanistan.
(Applause)
Afghanistan looks so different from here in America.
I find that Americans see the fragility in changes.
I fear that these changes will not last
much beyond the U.S. troops' withdrawal.
But when I am back in Afghanistan,
when I see the students in my school
and their parents who advocate for them,
who encourage them, I see a promising future
and lasting change.
To me, Afghanistan is a country of hope and boundless possibilities,
and every single day
the girls of SOLA remind me of that.
Like me, they are dreaming big.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Two weeks ago I was in my studio in Paris,
and the phone rang and I heard,
"Hey, JR,
you won the TED Prize 2011.
You have to make a wish to save the world."
I was lost.
I mean, I can't save the world. Nobody can.
The world is fucked up.
Come on, you have dictators ruling the world,
population is growing by millions,
there's no more fish in the sea,
the North Pole is melting
and as the last TED Prize winner said,
we're all becoming fat.
(Laughter)
Except maybe French people.
Whatever.
So I called back
and I told her,
"Look, Amy,
tell the TED guys I just won't show up.
I can't do anything to save the world."
She said, "Hey, JR,
your wish is not to save the world, but to change the world."
"Oh, all right."
(Laughter)
"That's cool."
I mean, technology, politics, business
do change the world --
not always in a good way, but they do.
What about art?
Could art change the world?
I started when I was 15 years old.
And at that time, I was not thinking about changing the world.
I was doing graffiti --
writing my name everywhere,
using the city as a canvas.
I was going in the tunnels of Paris,
on the rooftops with my friends.
Each trip was an excursion,
was an adventure.
It was like leaving our mark on society,
to say, "I was here," on the top of a building.
So when I found a cheap camera on the subway,
I started documenting those adventures with my friends
and gave them back as photocopies --
really small photos just that size.
That's how, at 17 years old,
I started pasting them.
And I did my first "expo de rue,"
which means sidewalk gallery.
And I framed it with color
so you would not confuse it with advertising.
I mean, the city's the best gallery I could imagine.
I would never have to make a book and then present it to a gallery
and let them decide
if my work was nice enough to show it to people.
I would control it directly with the public
in the streets.
So that's Paris.
I would change --
depending on the places I would go --
the title of the exhibition.
That's on the Champs-Elysees.
I was quite proud of that one.
Because I was just 18
and I was just up there on the top of the Champs-Elysees.
Then when the photo left,
the frame was still there.
(Laughter)
November 2005:
the streets are burning.
A large wave of riots
had broken into the first projects of Paris.
Everyone was glued to the TV,
watching disturbing, frightening images
taken from the edge of the neighborhood.
I mean, these kids, without control,
throwing Molotov cocktails,
attacking the cops and the firemen,
looting everything they could in the shops.
These were criminals, thugs, dangerous,
destroying their own environment.
And then I saw it -- could it be possible? --
my photo on a wall
revealed by a burning car --
a pasting I'd done a year earlier --
an illegal one -- still there.
I mean, these were the faces of my friends.
I know those guys.
All of them are not angels,
but they're not monsters either.
So it was kind of weird to see
those images and those eyes stare back at me through a television.
So I went back there
with a 28 mm lens.
It was the only one I had at that time.
But with that lens,
you have to be as close as 10 inches from the person.
So you can do it only with their trust.
So I took full portraits of people from Le Bosquet.
They were making scary faces
to play the caricature of themselves.
And then I pasted huge posters everywhere
in the bourgeois area of Paris
with the name, age, even building number
of these guys.
A year later,
the exhibition was displayed in front of the city hall of Paris.
And we go from thug images,
who've been stolen and distorted by the media,
who's now proudly taking over his own image.
That's where I realized
the power of paper and glue.
So could art change the world?
A year later,
I was listening to all the noise
about the Middle East conflict.
I mean, at that time, trust me,
they were only referring to the Israeli and Palestinian conflict.
So with my friend Marco,
we decided to go there
and see who are the real Palestinians and who are the real Israelis.
Are they so different?
When we got there, we just went in the street,
started talking with people everywhere,
and we realized that things were a bit different
from the rhetoric we heard in the media.
So we decided to take portraits
of Palestinians and Israelis
doing the same jobs --
taxi-driver, lawyer, cooks.
Asked them to make a face as a sign of commitment.
Not a smile -- that really doesn't tell
about who you are and what you feel.
They all accepted
to be pasted next to the other.
I decided to paste
in eight Israeli and Palestinian cities
and on both sides of the wall.
We launched the biggest illegal art exhibition ever.
We called the project Face 2 Face.
The experts said, "No way.
The people will not accept.
The army will shoot you, and Hamas will kidnap you."
We said, "Okay, let's try and push as far as we can."
I love the way that people will ask me,
"How big will my photo be?"
"It will be as big as your house."
When we did the wall, we did the Palestinian side.
So we arrived with just our ladders
and we realized that they were not high enough.
And so Palestinians guys say,
"Calm down. No wait. I'm going to find you a solution."
So he went to the Church of Nativity
and brought back an old ladder
that was so old that it could have seen Jesus being born.
(Laughter)
We did Face 2 Face with only six friends,
two ladders, two brushes,
a rented car, a camera
and 20,000 square feet of paper.
We had all sorts of help
from all walks of life.
Okay, for example, that's Palestine.
We're in Ramallah right now.
We're pasting portraits --
so both portraits in the streets in a crowded market.
People come around us and start asking,
"What are you doing here?"
"Oh, we're actually doing an art project
and we are pasting an Israeli and a Palestinian doing the same job.
And those ones are actually two taxi-drivers."
And then there was always a silence.
"You mean you're pasting an Israeli face --
doing a face -- right here?"
"Well, yeah, yeah, that's part of the project."
And I would always leave that moment,
and we would ask them,
"So can you tell me who is who?"
And most of them couldn't say.
(Applause)
We even pasted on Israeli military towers,
and nothing happened.
When you paste an image, it's just paper and glue.
People can tear it, tag on it, or even pee on it --
some are a bit high for that, I agree --
but the people in the street,
they are the curator.
The rain and the wind will take them off anyway.
They are not meant to stay.
But exactly four years after,
the photos, most of them are still there.
Face 2 Face demonstrated
that what we thought impossible was possible --
and, you know what, even easy.
We didn't push the limit;
we just showed that they were further than anyone thought.
In the Middle East, I experienced my work
in places without [many] museums.
So the reactions in the street
were kind of interesting.
So I decided to go further in this direction
and go in places where there were zero museums.
When you go in these developing societies,
women are the pillars of their community,
but the men are still the ones holding the streets.
So we were inspired to create a project
where men will pay tribute to women
by posting their photos.
I called that project Women Are Heroes.
When I listened to all the stories
everywhere I went on the continents,
I couldn't always understand
the complicated circumstances of their conflict.
I just observed.
Sometimes there was no words,
no sentence, just tears.
I just took their pictures
and pasted them.
Women Are Heroes took me around the world.
Most of the places I went to,
I decided to go there
because I've heard about it through the media.
So for example, in June 2008,
I was watching TV in Paris,
and then I heard about this terrible thing
that happened in Rio de Janeiro --
the first favela of Brazil named Providencia.
Three kids -- that was three students --
were [detained] by the army
because they were not carrying their papers.
And the army took them,
and instead of bringing them to the police station,
they brought them to an enemy favela
where they get chopped into pieces.
I was shocked.
All Brazil was shocked.
I heard it was one of the most violent favelas,
because the largest drug cartel controls it.
So I decided to go there.
When I arrived --
I mean, I didn't have any contact with any NGO.
There was none in place -- no association, no NGOs, nothing --
no eyewitnesses.
So we just walked around,
and we met a woman,
and I showed her my book.
And she said, "You know what?
We're hungry for culture.
We need culture out there."
So I went out and I started with the kids.
I just took a few photos of the kids,
and the next day I came with the posters and we pasted them.
The day after, I came back and they were already scratched.
But that's okay.
I wanted them to feel that this art belongs to them.
Then the next day, I held a meeting on the main square
and some women came.
They were all linked to the three kids that got killed.
There was the mother, the grandmother, the best friend --
they all wanted to shout the story.
After that day,
everyone in the favela gave me the green light.
I took more photos, and we started the project.
The drug lords were kind of worried
about us filming in the place,
so I told them, "You know what?
I'm not interested in filming the violence and the weapons.
You see that enough in the media.
What I want to show is the incredible life and energy.
I've been seeing it around me the last few days."
So that's a really symbolic pasting,
because that's the first one we did that you couldn't see from the city.
And that's where the three kids got arrested,
and that's the grandmother of one of them.
And on that stairs,
that's where the traffickers always stand
and there's a lot of exchange of fire.
Everyone there understood the project.
And then we pasted everywhere -- the whole hill.
(Applause)
What was interesting is that the media couldn't get in.
I mean, you should see that.
They would have to film us from a really long distance by helicopter
and then have a really long lens,
and we would see ourselves, on TV, pasting.
And they would put a number: "Please call this number
if you know what's going on in Providencia."
We just did a project and then left
so the media wouldn't know.
So how can we know about the project?
So they had to go and find the women
and get an explanation from them.
So you create a bridge between the media
and the anonymous women.
We kept traveling.
We went to Africa, Sudan, Sierra Leone,
Liberia, Kenya.
In war-torn places like Monrovia,
people come straight to you.
I mean, they want to know what you're up to.
They kept asking me, "What is the purpose of your project?
Are you an NGO? Are you the media?"
Art. Just doing art.
Some people question, "Why is it in black and white?
Don't you have color in France?"
(Laughter)
Or they tell you, "Are these people all dead?"
Some who understood the project would explain it to others.
And to a man who did not understand, I heard someone say,
"You know, you've been here for a few hours
trying to understand, discussing with your fellows.
During that time, you haven't thought about
what you're going to eat tomorrow.
This is art."
I think it's people's curiosity
that motivates them
to come into the projects.
And then it becomes more.
It becomes a desire, a need, an armor.
On this bridge that's in Monrovia,
ex-rebel soldiers helped us pasting a portrait
of a woman that might have been raped during the war.
Women are always the first ones targeted
during conflict.
This is Kibera, Kenya,
one of the largest slums of Africa.
You might have seen images about the post-election violence
that happened there in 2008.
This time we covered the roofs of the houses,
but we didn't use paper,
because paper doesn't prevent the rain
from leaking inside the house --
vinyl does.
Then art becomes useful.
So the people kept it.
You know what I love is, for example, when you see the biggest eye there,
there are so [many] houses inside.
And I went there a few months ago --
photos are still there -- and it was missing a piece of the eye.
So I asked the people what happened.
"Oh, that guy just moved."
(Laughter)
When the roofs were covered, a woman said as a joke,
"Now God can see me."
When you look at Kibera now,
they look back.
Okay, India.
Before I start that, just so you know,
each time we go to a place, we don't have authorization,
so we set up like commandos --
we're a group of friends who arrive there,
and we try to paste on the walls.
But there are places where you just can't paste on a wall.
In India it was just impossible to paste.
I heard culturally and because of the law,
they would just arrest us at the first pasting.
So we decided to paste white,
white on the walls.
So imagine white guys pasting white papers.
So people would come to us and ask us,
"Hey, what are you up to?"
"Oh, you know, we're just doing art." "Art?"
Of course, they were confused.
But you know how India has a lot of dust in the streets,
and the more dust you would have
going up in the air,
on the white paper you can almost see,
but there is this sticky part
like when you reverse a sticker.
So the more dust you have, the more it will reveal the photo.
So we could just walk in the street during the next days
and the photos would get revealed by themselves.
(Applause)
Thank you.
So we didn't get caught this time.
Each project -- that's a film
from Women Are Heroes.
(Music)
Okay.
For each project we do
a film.
And most of what you see -- that's a trailer from "Women Are Heroes" --
its images, photography,
taken one after the other.
And the photos kept traveling even without us.
(Laughter)
(Applause)
Hopefully, you'll see the film,
and you'll understand the scope of the project
and what the people felt when they saw those photos.
Because that's a big part of it. There's layers behind each photo.
Behind each image is a story.
Women Are Heroes created a new dynamic
in each of the communities,
and the women kept that dynamic after we left.
For example, we did books -- not for sale --
that all the community would get.
But to get it, they would have to [get] it signed by one of the women.
We did that in most of the places.
We go back regularly.
And so in Providencia, for example, in the favela,
we have a cultural center running there.
In Kibera, each year we cover more roofs.
Because of course, when we left, the people who were just at the edge of the project
said, "Hey, what about my roof?"
So we decided to come the year after
and keep doing the project.
A really important point for me
is that I don't use any brand or corporate sponsors.
So I have no responsibility
to anyone but myself
and the subjects.
(Applause)
And that is for me
one of the more important things in the work.
I think, today,
as important as the result is the way you do things.
And that has always been a central part of the work.
And what's interesting is that fine line that I have
with images and advertising.
We just did some pasting in Los Angeles
on another project in the last weeks.
And I was even invited to cover the MOCA museum.
But yesterday the city called them and said,
"Look, you're going to have to tear it down.
Because this can be taken for advertising,
and because of the law,
it has to be taken down."
But tell me, advertising for what?
The people I photograph
were proud to participate in the project
and to have their photo in the community.
But they asked me for a promise basically.
They asked me, "Please, make our story travel with you."
So I did. That's Paris.
That's Rio.
In each place, we built exhibitions with a story, and the story traveled.
You understand the full scope of the project.
That's London.
New York.
And today, they are with you in Long Beach.
All right, recently I started a public art project
where I don't use my artwork anymore.
I use Man Ray, Helen Levitt,
Giacomelli, other people's artwork.
It doesn't matter today if it's your photo or not.
The importance is what you do
with the images,
the statement it makes where it's pasted.
So for example, I pasted the photo of the minaret
in Switzerland
a few weeks after they voted the law forbidding minarets in the country.
(Applause)
This image of three men wearing gas masks
was taken in Chernobyl originally,
and I pasted it in Southern Italy,
where the mafia sometimes bury the garbage under the ground.
In some ways, art can change the world.
Art is not supposed to change the world,
to change practical things,
but to change perceptions.
Art can change
the way we see the world.
Art can create an analogy.
Actually the fact that art cannot change things
makes it a neutral place
for exchanges and discussions,
and then enables you to change the world.
When I do my work,
I have two kinds of reactions.
People say, "Oh, why don't you go in Iraq or Afghanistan.
They would be really useful."
Or, "How can we help?"
I presume that you belong to the second category,
and that's good,
because for that project,
I'm going to ask you to take the photos
and paste them.
So now my wish is:
(mock drum roll)
(Laughter)
I wish for you to stand up
for what you care about
by participating in a global art project,
and together we'll turn the world inside out.
And this starts right now.
Yes, everyone in the room.
Everyone watching.
I wanted that wish
to actually start now.
So a subject you're passionate about, a person who you want to tell their story
or even your own photos --
tell me what you stand for.
Take the photos, the portraits,
upload it -- I'll give you all the details --
and I'll send you back your poster. Join by groups
and reveal things to the world.
The full data is on the website --
insideoutproject.net --
that is launching today.
What we see changes who we are.
When we act together,
the whole thing is much more than the sum of the parts.
So I hope that, together, we'll create something
that the world will remember.
And this starts right now and depends on you.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Thank you.
(Applause)
Hi.
I've received hate online.
A lot of it.
And it comes
with the territory of my work.
I'm a digital creator,
I make things specifically
for the internet.
Like, a few years ago, I made
a video series called "Every Single Word"
where I edited down popular films
to only the words
spoken by people of color,
as a way to empirically and accessibly
talk about the issue of representation
in Hollywood.
Then, later, as transphobic bathroom bill
started gaining media attention
around the United States,
I hosted and produced an interview series
called "Sitting in Bathrooms
with Trans People"
where I did exactly that.
(Laughter)
And then --
Sure, I'll take applause.
(Applause)
Thank you.
And then, are you familiar
with those unboxing videos on YouTube
where YouTubers open up
the latest electronic gadgets?
Great, so I satirized those
in a weekly series,
where instead I unboxed
intangible ideologies
like police brutality, masculinity
and the mistreatment of Native Americans.
(Laughter)
My work --
Thanks.
One person applauding, God bless.
(Laughter)
Mom, hi.
(Laughter)
So, my work became popular.
Very popular.
I got millions of views,
a ton of great press
and a slew of new followers.
But the flip side of success
on the internet
is internet hate.
I was called everything.
From "beta" to "snowflake"
and, of course, the ever-popular "cuck."
Don't worry, I will break
these terms down for you.
(Laughter)
So, "beta," for those of you unfamiliar,
is shorthand online lingo for "beta male."
But let's be real, I wear pearl earrings
and my fashion aesthetic
is rich-white-woman-running-errands,
so I'm not angling to be an alpha.
(Applause)
Doesn't totally work.
(Laughter)
Now, "snowflake" is a put-down
for people who are sensitive
and believe themselves to be unique,
and I'm a millennial
and an only child, so, duh!
(Laughter)
But my favorite, favorite,
favorite is "cuck."
It's a slur, short for "cuckold,"
for men who have been
cheated on by their wives.
But friends, I am so gay,
that if I had a wife, I would
encourage her to cheat on me.
(Laughter)
Thank you.
Let's take a look at some
of this negativity in action.
Sometimes it's direct.
Like Marcos, who wrote,
"You're everything I hate
in a human being."
Thank you, Marcos.
Others are more concise.
Like Donovan, who wrote,
"gaywad fagggggg."
Now, I do need to point out,
Donovan is not wrong, OK?
In fact, he's right on both counts,
so credit where credit is due.
Thank you, Donovan.
Others write to me with questions,
like Brian, who asked,
"Were you born a bitch or did you
just learn to be one over time?"
But my favorite thing about this
is that once Brian was done typing,
his finger must have slipped
because then he sent me
the thumbs-up emoji.
(Laughter)
So, babe, thumbs up to you, too.
(Laughter)
It's fun to talk about these messages now.
Right?
And it's cathartic to laugh at them.
But I can tell you that it really
does not feel good to receive them.
At first, I would screenshot
their comments
and make fun of their typos,
but this soon felt elitist
and ultimately unhelpful.
So over time, I developed
an unexpected coping mechanism.
Because most of these messages I received
were through social media,
I could often click on the profile picture
of the person who sent them
and learn everything about them.
I could see pictures they were tagged in,
posts they'd written, memes they'd shared,
and somehow, seeing that it was
a human on the other side of the screen
made me feel a little better.
Not to justify what they wrote, right?
But just to provide context.
Still, that didn't feel like enough.
So, I called some of them --
only the ones I felt safe talking to --
with a simple opening question:
"Why did you write that?"
The first person I spoke to was Josh.
He had written to tell me
that I was a moron,
I was a reason this country
was dividing itself,
and he added at the end
that being gay was a sin.
I was so nervous
for our first conversation.
This wasn't a comments section.
So I couldn't use tools
like muting or blocking.
Of course, I guess,
I could have hung up on him.
But I didn't want to.
Because I liked talking to him.
Because I liked him.
Here's a clip of one of our conversations.
(Audio) Dylan Marron: Josh, you said
you're about to graduate
high school, right?
Josh: Mmm-hmm.
DM: How is high school for you?
Josh: Am I allowed to use
the H-E-double-hockey-stick word?
DM: Oh, yeah. You're allowed to.
Josh: It was hell.
DM: Really?
Josh: And it's still hell right now,
even though it's only two weeks left.
I'm a little bit bigger --
I don't like to use the word "fat,"
but I am a little bit bigger
than a lot of my classmates
and they seem to judge me
before they even got to know me.
DM: That's awful.
I mean, I also just want
to let you know, Josh,
I was bullied in high school, too.
So did our common ground
of being bullied in high school
erase what he wrote me?
No.
And did our single phone conversation
radically heal a politically
divided country
and cure systemic injustice?
No, absolutely not, right?
But did our conversation
humanize us to each other
more than profile pictures
and posts ever could?
Absolutely.
I didn't stop there.
Because some of the hate I received
was from "my side."
So when Matthew,
a queer liberal artist like me
publicly wrote that I represented
some of the worst aspects of liberalism,
I wanted to ask him this.
DM: You tagged me in this post.
Did you want me to see it?
Matthew (Laughing): I honestly
didn't think that you would.
DM: Have you ever been publicly dragged?
Matthew: I have been.
And I just said, "No, I don't care."
DM: And did you not care?
Matthew: But it was hard.
DM: Did you not care?
Matthew: Oh, I cared, yes.
DM: At the end of these conversations,
there's often a moment of reflection.
A reconsideration.
And that's exactly what happened
at the end of my call
with a guy named Doug
who had written that I was
a talentless propaganda hack.
(Audio) Did the conversation
we just had --
does it, like, make you feel differently
about how you write online?
Doug: Yeah! You know,
when I said this to you,
when I said you were a "talentless hack,"
I had never conversed
with you in my life, really.
I didn't really know anything
really about you.
And I think that a lot of times,
that's what the comment
sections really are,
it's really a way to get
your anger at the world out
on random profiles
of strangers, pretty much.
DM (Laughing): Yeah, right.
Doug: But it definitely
has made me rethink
the way that I interact
with people online.
DM: So I've collected these
conversations and many others
for my podcast "Conversations
with People Who Hate Me."
(Laughter)
Before I started this project,
I thought that the real way
to bring about change
was to shut down opposing viewpoints
through epically worded
video essays and comments and posts,
but I soon learned
those were only cheered on
by the people who already agreed with me.
Sometimes -- bless you.
Sometimes, the most subversive
thing you could do --
yeah, clap for him.
(Laughter)
Sometimes, the most subversive
thing you could do
was to actually speak
with the people you disagreed with,
and not simply at them.
Now in every one of my calls,
I always ask my guests
to tell me about themselves.
And it's their answer to this question
that allows me to empathize with them.
And empathy, it turns out,
is a key ingredient in getting
these conversations off the ground,
but it can feel very vulnerable
to be empathizing with someone
you profoundly disagree with.
So I established
a helpful mantra for myself.
Empathy is not endorsement.
Empathizing with someone
you profoundly disagree with
does not suddenly compromise
your own deeply held beliefs
and endorse theirs.
Empathizing with someone who, for example,
believes that being gay is a sin
doesn't mean that I'm suddenly
going to drop everything,
pack my bags and grab
my one-way ticket to hell, right?
It just means that I'm acknowledging
the humanity of someone who was raised
to think very differently from me.
I also want to be super clear
about something.
This is not a prescription for activism.
I understand that
some people don't feel safe
talking to their detractors
and others feel so marginalized
that they justifiably don't feel
that they have any empathy to give.
I totally get that.
This is just what I feel
well-suited to do.
You know, I've reached out
to a lot of people for this podcast.
And some have politely declined,
others have read my message
and ignored it,
some have blocked me automatically
when I sent the invitation
and one guy actually agreed to do it
and then, five minutes into the call,
hung up on me.
I'm also aware that this talk
will appear on the internet.
And with the internet comes
comment sections,
and with comment sections
inevitably comes hate.
So as you are watching this talk,
you can feel free to call me
whatever you'd like.
You can call me a "gaywad,"
a "snowflake," a "cuck," a "beta,"
or "everything wrong with liberalism."
But just know that if you do,
I may ask you to talk.
And if you refuse
or block me automatically
or agree and hang up on me,
then maybe, babe, the snowflake is you.
Thank you so much.
(Applause)
(Cheering)
(Applause)
So today, I want us to reflect
on the demise of guys.
Guys are flaming out academically;
they're wiping out socially with girls
and sexually with women.
Other than that, there's not much of a problem.
So what's the data?
So the data on dropping out is amazing.
Boys are 30 percent more likely than girls
to drop out of school.
In Canada, five boys drop out for every three girls.
Girls outperform boys now at every level,
from elementary school to graduate school.
There's a 10 percent differential
between getting BA's and all graduate programs,
with guys falling behind girls.
Two-thirds of all students in special ed. remedial programs are guys.
And as you all know,
boys are five times more likely than girls
to be labeled as having attention deficit disorder --
and therefore we drug them with Ritalin.
What's the evidence of wiping out?
First, it's a new fear of intimacy.
Intimacy means physical, emotional connection
with somebody else --
and especially with somebody of the opposite sex
who gives off ambiguous, contradictory,
phosphorescent signals.
(Laughter)
And every year there's research done
on self-reported shyness among college students.
And we're seeing a steady increase among males.
And this is two kinds.
It's a social awkwardness.
The old shyness was a fear of rejection.
It's a social awkwardness like you're a stranger in a foreign land.
They don't know what to say, they don't know what to do,
especially one-on-one [with the] opposite sex.
They don't know the language of face contact,
the non-verbal and verbal set of rules
that enable you to comfortably talk to somebody else,
listen to somebody else.
There's something I'm developing here called social intensity syndrome,
which tries to account for why guys really prefer
male bonding over female mating.
It turns out, from earliest childhood,
boys, and then men,
prefer the company of guys --
physical company.
And there's actually a cortical arousal we're looking at,
because guys have been with guys
in teams, in clubs, in gangs, in fraternities,
especially in the military, and then in pubs.
And this peaks at Super Bowl Sunday
when guys would rather be in a bar with strangers,
watching a totally overdressed Aaron Rodgers of the Green Bay Packers,
rather than Jennifer Lopez totally naked in the bedroom.
The problem is they now prefer
[the] asynchronistic Internet world
to the spontaneous interaction
in social relationships.
What are the causes? Well, it's an unintended consequence.
I think it's excessive Internet use in general, excessive video gaming,
excessive new access to pornography.
The problem is these are arousal addictions.
Drug addiction, you simply want more.
Arousal addiction, you want different.
Drugs, you want more of the same -- different.
So you need the novelty in order for the arousal to be sustained.
And the problem is the industry is supplying it.
Jane McGonigal told us last year
that by the time a boy is 21,
he's played 10,000 hours of video games,
most of that in isolation.
As you remember, Cindy Gallop said
men don't know the difference
between making love and doing porn.
The average boy now watches 50 porn video clips a week.
And there's some guy watching a hundred, obviously.
(Laughter)
And the porn industry is the fastest growing industry in America --
15 billion annually.
For every 400 movies made in Hollywood,
there are 11,000 now made porn videos.
So the effect, very quickly,
is it's a new kind of arousal.
Boys' brains are being digitally rewired in a totally new way
for change, novelty, excitement and constant arousal.
That means they're totally out of sync in traditional classes,
which are analog, static, interactively passive.
They're also totally out of sync
in romantic relationships,
which build gradually and subtly.
So what's the solution? It's not my job.
I'm here to alarm. It's your job to solve.
(Laughter)
(Applause)
But who should care? The only people who should care about this
is parents of boys and girls,
educators, gamers, filmmakers
and women who would like a real man
who they can talk to, who can dance,
who can make love slowly
and contribute to the evolutionary pressures
to keep our species above banana slugs.
No offense to banana slug owners. Thank you.
(Applause)
What is a parent?
What is a parent?
It's not an easy question.
Today we have adoption,
stepfamilies,
surrogate mothers.
Many parents face tough questions
and tough decisions.
Shall we tell our child
about the sperm donation?
If so, when?
What words to use?
Sperm donors are often referred
to as "biological fathers,"
but should we really
be using the word "father?"
As a philosopher and social scientist,
I have been studying these questions
about the concept of parenthood.
But today, I will talk to you
about what I learned
from talking to parents and children.
I will show you that they know
what matters most in a family,
even though their family
looks a little different.
I will show you their creative ways
of dealing with tough questions.
But I will also show you
the parents' uncertainties.
We interviewed couples
who received fertility treatment
at Ghent University Hospital,
using sperm from a donor.
In this treatment timeline,
you can see two points
at which we conducted interviews.
We included heterosexual couples,
where the man for some reason
did not have good-quality sperm,
and lesbian couples who obviously
needed to find sperm elsewhere.
We also included children.
I wanted to know
how those children define concepts
like parenthood and family.
In fact, that is what I asked them,
only not in that way.
I drew an apple tree instead.
This way, I could ask abstract,
philosophical questions
in a way that did not make them run off.
So as you can see,
the apple tree is empty.
And that illustrates my research approach.
By designing techniques like this,
I can bring as little meaning and content
as possible to the interview,
because I want to hear that from them.
I asked them:
What would your family look like
if it were an apple tree?
And they could take a paper apple
for everyone who, in their view,
was a member of the family,
write a name on it
and hang it wherever they wanted.
And I would ask questions.
Most children started
with a parent or a sibling.
One started with "Boxer,"
the dead dog of his grandparents.
At this point, none of the children
started mentioning the donor.
So, I asked them about their birth story.
I said, "Before you were born,
it was just your mom and dad,
or mom and mommy.
Can you tell me how you came
into the family?"
And they explained.
One said,
"My parents did not have good seeds,
but there are friendly men out there
who have spare seeds.
They bring them to the hospital,
and they put them in a big jar.
My mommy went there,
and she took two from the jar,
one for me and one for my sister.
She put the seeds in her belly --
somehow --
and her belly grew really big,
and there I was."
Hmm.
So only when they started
mentioning the donor,
I asked questions about him,
using their own words.
I said,
"If this would be an apple
for the friendly man with the seeds,
what would you do with it?"
And one boy was thinking out loud,
holding the apple.
And he said,
"I won't put this one
up there with the others.
He's not part of my family.
But I will not put him on the ground.
That's too cold and too hard.
I think he should be in the trunk,
because he made my family possible.
If he would not have done this,
that would really be sad
because my family would not be here,
and I would not be here."
So also, parents
constructed family tales --
tales to tell their children.
One couple explained their insemination
by taking their children to a farm
to watch a vet inseminate cows.
And why not?
It's their way of explaining;
their do-it-yourself
with family narratives.
DIY.
And we had another couple
who made books --
a book for each child.
They were really works of art
containing their thoughts and feelings
throughout the treatment.
They even had the hospital
parking tickets in there.
So it is DIY:
finding ways, words and images
to tell your family story to your child.
And these stories were highly diverse,
but they all had one thing in common:
it was a tale of longing for a child
and a quest for that child.
It was about how special
and how deeply loved their child was.
And research so far shows
that these children are doing fine.
They do not have
more problems than other kids.
Yet, these parents also wanted
to justify their decisions
through the tales they tell.
They hoped that their children
would understand their reasons
for making the family in this way.
Underlying was a fear
that their children might disapprove
and would reject the non-genetic parent.
And that fear is understandable,
because we live in a very heteronormative
and geneticized society --
a world that still believes
that true families consist
of one mom, one dad
and their genetically related children.
Well.
I want to tell you about a teenage boy.
He was donor-conceived
but not part of our study.
One day, he had an argument
with his father,
and he yelled,
"You're telling me what to do?
You're not even my father!"
That was exactly what
the parents in our study feared.
Now, the boy soon felt sorry,
and they made up.
But it is the reaction of his father
that is most interesting.
He said,
"This outburst had nothing to do
with the lack of a genetic link.
It was about puberty --
being difficult.
It's what they do at that age.
It will pass."
What this man shows us
is that when something goes wrong,
we should not immediately think
it is because the family
is a little different.
These things happen in all families.
And every now and then,
all parents may wonder:
Am I a good enough parent?
These parents, too.
They, above all, wanted to do
what's best for their child.
But they also sometimes wondered:
Am I a real parent?
And their uncertainties were present
long before they even were parents.
At the start of treatment,
when they first saw the counselor,
they paid close attention
to the counselor,
because they wanted to do it right.
Even 10 years later,
they still remember
the advice they were given.
So when they thought about the counselor
and the advice they were given,
we discussed that.
And we saw one lesbian couple who said,
"When our son asks us,
'Do I have a dad?'
we will say 'No, you do not have a dad.'
But we will say nothing more,
not unless he asks,
because he might not be ready for that.
The counselor said so."
Well.
I don't know; that's quite different
from how we respond
to children's questions.
Like, "Milk -- is that made in a factory?"
We will say, "No, it comes from cows,"
and we will talk about the farmer,
and the way the milk ends up in the shop.
We will not say,
"No, milk is not made in a factory."
So something strange happened here,
and of course these children noticed that.
One boy said,
"I asked my parents loads of questions,
but they acted really weird.
So, you know, I have a friend at school,
and she's made in the same way.
When I have a question,
I just go and ask her."
Clever guy.
Problem solved.
But his parents did not notice,
and it certainly was not
what they had in mind,
nor what the counselor had in mind
when they were saying how important
it is to be an open-communication family.
And that's the strange thing about advice.
When we offer people pills,
we gather evidence first.
We do tests,
we do follow-up studies.
We want to know, and rightly so,
what this pill is doing
and how it affects people's lives.
And advice?
It is not enough for advice,
or for professionals to give advice
that is theoretically sound,
or well-meant.
It should be advice
that there is evidence for --
evidence that it actually
improves patients' lives.
So the philosopher in me
would now like to offer you a paradox:
I advise you to stop following advice.
But, yes.
(Applause)
I will not end here with what went wrong;
I would not be doing justice
to the warmth we found in those families.
Remember the books
and the trip to the farmer?
When parents do things that work for them,
they do brilliant things.
What I want you to remember
as members of families,
in no matter what form or shape,
is that what families need
are warm relationships.
And we do not need to be
professionals to create those.
Most of us do just fine,
although it may be hard work,
and from time to time,
we can do with some advice.
In that case,
bear in mind three things.
Work with advice
that works for your family.
Remember -- you're the expert,
because you live your family life.
And finally,
believe in your abilities
and your creativity,
because you can do it yourself.
Thank you.
(Applause)
I grew up to study the brain
because I have a brother
who has been diagnosed
with a brain disorder, schizophrenia.
And as a sister and later, as a scientist,
I wanted to understand,
why is it that I can take my dreams,
I can connect them to my reality,
and I can make my dreams come true?
What is it about my brother's brain
and his schizophrenia
that he cannot connect his dreams
to a common and shared reality,
so they instead become delusion?
So I dedicated my career to research
into the severe mental illnesses.
And I moved from my home state
of Indiana to Boston,
where I was working in the lab
of Dr. Francine Benes,
in the Harvard Department of Psychiatry.
And in the lab,
we were asking the question,
"What are the biological differences
between the brains of individuals
who would be diagnosed as normal control,
as compared with the brains of individuals
diagnosed with schizophrenia,
schizoaffective or bipolar disorder?"
So we were essentially
mapping the microcircuitry of the brain:
which cells are communicating
with which cells,
with which chemicals,
and then in what quantities
of those chemicals?
So there was a lot of meaning in my life
because I was performing
this type of research during the day,
but then in the evenings
and on the weekends,
I traveled as an advocate for NAMI,
the National Alliance on Mental Illness.
But on the morning of December 10, 1996,
I woke up to discover that I had
a brain disorder of my own.
A blood vessel exploded
in the left half of my brain.
And in the course of four hours,
I watched my brain completely deteriorate
in its ability to process all information.
On the morning of the hemorrhage,
I could not walk, talk, read,
write or recall any of my life.
I essentially became
an infant in a woman's body.
If you've ever seen a human brain,
it's obvious that the two hemispheres
are completely separate from one another.
And I have brought for you
a real human brain.
(Groaning, laughter)
So this is a real human brain.
This is the front of the brain,
the back of brain
with the spinal cord hanging down,
and this is how it would be
positioned inside of my head.
And when you look at the brain,
it's obvious that
the two cerebral cortices
are completely separate from one another.
For those of you who understand computers,
our right hemisphere functions
like a parallel processor,
while our left hemisphere functions
like a serial processor.
The two hemispheres
do communicate with one another
through the corpus callosum,
which is made up of some
300 million axonal fibers.
But other than that,
the two hemispheres
are completely separate.
Because they process
information differently,
each of our hemispheres
think about different things,
they care about different things,
and, dare I say,
they have very different personalities.
Excuse me. Thank you. It's been a joy.
Assistant: It has been.
(Laughter)
Our right human hemisphere
is all about this present moment.
It's all about "right here, right now."
Our right hemisphere,
it thinks in pictures
and it learns kinesthetically
through the movement of our bodies.
Information, in the form of energy,
streams in simultaneously
through all of our sensory systems
and then it explodes
into this enormous collage
of what this present moment looks like,
what this present moment
smells like and tastes like,
what it feels like
and what it sounds like.
I am an energy-being connected
to the energy all around me
through the consciousness
of my right hemisphere.
We are energy-beings
connected to one another
through the consciousness
of our right hemispheres
as one human family.
And right here, right now, we are brothers
and sisters on this planet,
here to make the world a better place.
And in this moment we are perfect,
we are whole and we are beautiful.
My left hemisphere, our left hemisphere,
is a very different place.
Our left hemisphere
thinks linearly and methodically.
Our left hemisphere is all about the past
and it's all about the future.
Our left hemisphere is designed to take
that enormous collage
of the present moment
and start picking out details,
and more details about those details.
It then categorizes and organizes
all that information,
associates it with everything
in the past we've ever learned,
and projects into the future
all of our possibilities.
And our left hemisphere
thinks in language.
It's that ongoing brain chatter
that connects me and my internal world
to my external world.
It's that little voice that says to me,
"Hey, you've got to remember
to pick up bananas on your way home.
I need them in the morning."
It's that calculating intelligence
that reminds me
when I have to do my laundry.
But perhaps most important,
it's that little voice that says to me,
"I am. I am."
And as soon as my left hemisphere
says to me "I am,"
I become separate.
I become a single solid individual,
separate from the energy flow around me
and separate from you.
And this was the portion of my brain
that I lost on the morning of my stroke.
On the morning of the stroke,
I woke up to a pounding
pain behind my left eye.
And it was the kind of caustic pain
that you get when you bite into ice cream.
And it just gripped me --
and then it released me.
And then it just gripped me --
and then it released me.
And it was very unusual for me
to ever experience any kind of pain,
so I thought, "OK, I'll just start
my normal routine."
So I got up and I jumped
onto my cardio glider,
which is a full-body,
full-exercise machine.
And I'm jamming away on this thing,
and I'm realizing that my hands
look like primitive claws
grasping onto the bar.
And I thought, "That's very peculiar."
And I looked down at my body
and I thought,
"Whoa, I'm a weird-looking thing."
And it was as though my consciousness
had shifted away
from my normal perception of reality,
where I'm the person on the machine
having the experience,
to some esoteric space
where I'm witnessing myself
having this experience.
And it was all very peculiar,
and my headache was just getting worse.
So I get off the machine,
and I'm walking
across my living room floor,
and I realize that everything
inside of my body has slowed way down.
And every step is very rigid
and very deliberate.
There's no fluidity to my pace,
and there's this constriction
in my area of perception,
so I'm just focused on internal systems.
And I'm standing in my bathroom
getting ready to step into the shower,
and I could actually hear
the dialogue inside of my body.
I heard a little voice saying, "OK.
You muscles, you've got to contract.
You muscles, you relax."
And then I lost my balance,
and I'm propped up against the wall.
And I look down at my arm
and I realize that I can no longer define
the boundaries of my body.
I can't define where I begin
and where I end,
because the atoms
and the molecules of my arm
blended with the atoms
and molecules of the wall.
And all I could detect
was this energy -- energy.
And I'm asking myself,
"What is wrong with me?
What is going on?"
And in that moment, my left hemisphere
brain chatter went totally silent.
Just like someone took a remote control
and pushed the mute button.
Total silence.
And at first I was shocked to find myself
inside of a silent mind.
But then I was immediately captivated
by the magnificence
of the energy around me.
And because I could no longer
identify the boundaries of my body,
I felt enormous and expansive.
I felt at one with
all the energy that was,
and it was beautiful there.
Then all of a sudden
my left hemisphere comes back online
and it says to me,
"Hey! We've got a problem!
We've got to get some help."
And I'm going, "Ahh! I've got a problem!"
(Laughter)
So it's like, "OK, I've got a problem."
But then I immediately drifted
right back out into the consciousness --
and I affectionately
refer to this space as La La Land.
But it was beautiful there.
Imagine what it would be like to be
totally disconnected
from your brain chatter that connects you
to the external world.
So here I am in this space,
and my job, and any stress
related to my job -- it was gone.
And I felt lighter in my body.
And imagine all of the relationships
in the external world
and any stressors related
to any of those -- they were gone.
And I felt this sense of peacefulness.
And imagine
what it would feel like to lose
37 years of emotional baggage!
(Laughter) Oh! I felt euphoria --
euphoria.
It was beautiful.
And again, my left hemisphere
comes online and it says,
"Hey! You've got to pay attention.
We've got to get help."
And I'm thinking, "I've got to get help.
I've got to focus."
So I get out of the shower
and I mechanically dress
and I'm walking around my apartment,
and I'm thinking,
"I've got to get to work. Can I drive?"
And in that moment,
my right arm went totally
paralyzed by my side.
Then I realized, "Oh my gosh!
I'm having a stroke!"
And the next thing my brain says to me is,
Wow! This is so cool!
(Laughter)
This is so cool!
How many brain scientists
have the opportunity
to study their own brain
from the inside out?"
(Laughter)
And then it crosses my mind,
"But I'm a very busy woman!"
(Laughter)
"I don't have time for a stroke!"
So I'm like, "OK, I can't stop
the stroke from happening,
so I'll do this for a week or two,
and then I'll get back to my routine. OK.
So I've got to call help.
I've got to call work."
I couldn't remember the number at work,
so I remembered, in my office
I had a business card with my number.
So I go into my business room, I pull
out a three-inch stack of business cards.
And I'm looking at the card on top
and even though I could see clearly
in my mind's eye
what my business card looked like,
I couldn't tell if this
was my card or not,
because all I could see were pixels.
And the pixels of the words
blended with the pixels of the background
and the pixels of the symbols,
and I just couldn't tell.
And then I would wait
for what I call a wave of clarity.
And in that moment, I would be able
to reattach to normal reality
and I could tell that's not the card...
that's not the card.
It took me 45 minutes to get one inch
down inside of that stack of cards.
In the meantime, for 45 minutes,
the hemorrhage is getting bigger
in my left hemisphere.
I do not understand numbers,
I do not understand the telephone,
but it's the only plan I have.
So I take the phone pad
and I put it right here.
I take the business card,
I put it right here,
and I'm matching the shape
of the squiggles on the card
to the shape of the squiggles
on the phone pad.
But then I would drift back out
into La La Land,
and not remember when I came back
if I'd already dialed those numbers.
So I had to wield
my paralyzed arm like a stump
and cover the numbers
as I went along and pushed them,
so that as I would come back
to normal reality,
I'd be able to tell, "Yes,
I've already dialed that number."
Eventually, the whole number gets dialed
and I'm listening to the phone,
and my colleague picks up the phone
and he says to me,
"Woo woo woo woo." (Laughter)
(Laughter)
And I think to myself,
"Oh my gosh, he sounds
like a Golden Retriever!"
(Laughter)
And so I say to him --
clear in my mind, I say to him:
"This is Jill! I need help!"
And what comes out of my voice is,
"Woo woo woo woo woo."
I'm thinking, "Oh my gosh,
I sound like a Golden Retriever."
So I couldn't know -- I didn't know
that I couldn't speak or understand
language until I tried.
So he recognizes that I need help
and he gets me help.
And a little while later,
I am riding in an ambulance
from one hospital across Boston
to [Massachusetts] General Hospital.
And I curl up into a little fetal ball.
And just like a balloon
with the last bit of air,
just right out of the balloon,
I just felt my energy lift
and just I felt my spirit surrender.
And in that moment, I knew that I was
no longer the choreographer of my life.
And either the doctors rescue my body
and give me a second chance at life,
or this was perhaps
my moment of transition.
When I woke later that afternoon,
I was shocked to discover
that I was still alive.
When I felt my spirit surrender,
I said goodbye to my life.
And my mind was now suspended
between two very opposite
planes of reality.
Stimulation coming in
through my sensory systems
felt like pure pain.
Light burned my brain like wildfire,
and sounds were so loud and chaotic
that I could not pick a voice out
from the background noise,
and I just wanted to escape.
Because I could not identify the position
of my body in space,
I felt enormous and expansive,
like a genie just liberated
from her bottle.
And my spirit soared free,
like a great whale gliding
through the sea of silent euphoria.
Nirvana.
I found Nirvana.
And I remember thinking,
there's no way I would ever be able
to squeeze the enormousness of myself
back inside this tiny little body.
But then I realized, "But I'm still alive!
I'm still alive, and I have found Nirvana.
And if I have found Nirvana
and I'm still alive,
then everyone who is alive
can find Nirvana."
And I pictured a world
filled with beautiful, peaceful,
compassionate, loving people
who knew that they could come
to this space at any time.
And that they could purposely choose
to step to the right
of their left hemispheres --
and find this peace.
And then I realized
what a tremendous gift
this experience could be,
what a stroke of insight this could be
to how we live our lives.
And it motivated me to recover.
Two and a half weeks after the hemorrhage,
the surgeons went in,
and they removed a blood clot
the size of a golf ball
that was pushing on my language centers.
Here I am with my mama,
who is a true angel in my life.
It took me eight years
to completely recover.
So who are we?
We are the life-force power
of the universe,
with manual dexterity
and two cognitive minds.
And we have the power
to choose, moment by moment,
who and how we want to be in the world.
Right here, right now,
I can step into the consciousness
of my right hemisphere, where we are.
I am the life-force power of the universe.
I am the life-force power
of the 50 trillion beautiful
molecular geniuses that make up my form,
at one with all that is.
Or, I can choose to step into
the consciousness of my left hemisphere,
where I become
a single individual, a solid.
Separate from the flow, separate from you.
I am Dr. Jill Bolte Taylor:
intellectual, neuroanatomist.
These are the "we" inside of me.
Which would you choose?
Which do you choose?
And when?
I believe that the more time we spend
choosing to run the deep
inner-peace circuitry
of our right hemispheres,
the more peace we will project
into the world,
and the more peaceful our planet will be.
And I thought that was an idea
worth spreading.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Tyler Dewar: The way I feel right now
is that all of the other speakers
have said exactly what I wanted to say.
(Laughter)
And it seems that the only thing left for me to say
is to thank you all for your kindness.
TD: But maybe in the spirit
of appreciating the kindness of you all,
I could share with you
a little story about myself.
TD: From the time I was very young, onward,
I was given
a lot of different responsibilities,
and it always seemed to me, when I was young,
that everything was laid out before me.
All of the plans for me were already made.
I was given the clothes that I needed to wear
and told where I needed to be,
given these very precious
and holy looking robes to wear,
with the understanding
that it was something sacred or important.
TD: But before that kind of formal lifestyle happened for me,
I was living in eastern Tibet with my family.
And when I was seven years old,
all of a sudden,
a search party arrived at my home.
They were looking the next Karmapa,
and I noticed they were talking to my mom and dad,
and the news came to me that they were telling me
that I was the Karmapa.
And these days, people ask me a lot,
how did that feel.
How did that feel when they came and whisked you away,
and your lifestyle completely changed?
And what I mostly say is that,
at that time,
it was a pretty interesting idea to me.
I thought that things would be pretty fun
and there would be more things to play with.
(Laughter)
TD: But it didn't turn out to be so fun and entertaining,
as I thought it would have been.
I was placed
in a pretty strictly controlled environment.
And immediately,
a lot of different responsibilities,
in terms of my education and so forth, were heaped upon me.
I was separated, largely, from my family,
including my mother and father.
I didn't have have many personal friends
to spend time with,
but I was expected to perform
these prescribed duties.
So it turned out that my fantasy
about an entertaining life of being the Karmapa
wasn't going to come true.
It more felt to be the case to me
that I was being treated like a statue,
and I was to sit in one place
like a statue would.
TD: Nevertheless, I felt that,
even though I've been separated from my loved ones --
and, of course, now I'm even further away.
When I was 14, I escaped from Tibet
and became even further removed
from my mother and father,
my relatives, my friends
and my homeland.
But nevertheless,
there's no real sense of separation from me in my heart,
in terms of the love that I feel
for these people.
I feel, still, a very strong connection of love
for all of these people
and for the land.
TD: And I still do
get to keep in touch with my mother and father,
albeit infrequently.
I talk to my mother
once in a blue moon on the telephone.
And my experience is that,
when I'm talking to her,
with every second that passes
during our conversation,
the feeling of love that binds us
is bringing us closer and closer together.
TD: So those were just a few remarks
about my personal background.
And in terms of other things that I wanted to share with you,
in terms of ideas,
I think it's wonderful to have a situation like this,
where so many people from different backgrounds and places
can come together,
exchange their ideas
and form relationships of friendship with each other.
And I think that's symbolic
of what we're seeing in the world in general,
that the world is becoming smaller and smaller,
and that all of the peoples in the world
are enjoying more opportunities for connection.
That's wonderful,
but we should also remember
that we should have a similar process happening on the inside.
Along with outward development
and increase of opportunity,
there should be inward development
and deepening of our heart connections
as well as our outward connections.
So we spoke and we heard some
about design this week.
I think that it's important for us to remember
that we need
to keep pushing forward
on the endeavor
of the design of the heart.
We heard a lot about technology this week,
and it's important for us to remember
to invest a lot of our energy
in improving the technology of the heart.
TD: So, even though I'm somewhat happy
about the wonderful developments that are happening in the world,
still, I feel a sense of impediment,
when it comes
to the ability that we have
to connect with each other on a heart-to-heart, or a mind-to-mind, level.
I feel that there are some things
that are getting in the way.
TC: My relationship
to this concept of heart-to-heart connection, or mind-to-mind connection,
is an interesting one,
because, as a spiritual leader, I'm always attempting
to open my heart to others
and offer myself up
for heart-to-heart and mind-to-mind connections
in a genuine way with other people,
but at the same time,
I've always been advised
that I need to emphasize intelligence
over the heart-to-heart connections,
because, being someone in a position like mine,
if I don't rely primarily on intelligence,
then something dangerous may happen to me.
So it's an interesting paradox at play there.
But I had a really striking experience once,
when a group from Afghanistan
came to visit me,
and we had a really interesting conversation.
TD: So we ended up talking about the Bamiyan Buddhas,
which, as you know,
were destroyed some years ago in Afghanistan.
But the basis of our conversation
was the different approach to spirituality
on the part of the Muslim
and Buddhist traditions.
Of course, in Muslim,
because of the teachings around the concept of idolatry,
you don't find as many
physical representations of divinity
or of spiritual liberation
as you do in the Buddhist tradition,
where, of course, there are many statues of the Buddha
that are highly revered.
So, we were talking about the differences
between the traditions
and what many people perceived
as the tragedy of the destruction of the Bamiyan Buddhas,
but I offered the suggestion
that perhaps we could look at this in a positive way.
What we saw in the destruction of the Bamiyan Buddhas
was the depletion of matter,
some solid substance
falling down and disintegrating.
Maybe we could look at that to be more similar
to the falling of the Berlin Wall,
where a divide
that had kept two types of people apart
had collapsed and opened up a door
for further communication.
So I think that, in this way,
it's always possible for us
to derive something positive
that can help us understand one another better.
TD: So, with regard to the development
that we've been talking about
here at this conference,
I really feel
that the development that we make
shouldn't create a further burden
for us as human beings,
but should be used
to improve
our fundamental lifestyle
of how we live in the world.
TD: Of course, I rejoice
in the development and the growth and the rise
of the noble land of India, the great country of India,
but at the same time, I think,
as some of us have acknowledged,
we need to be aware
that some aspects of this rise
are coming at the cost
of the very ground
on which we stand.
So, as we are climbing the tree,
some of the things that we're doing
in order to climb the tree
are actually undermining
the tree's very root.
And so,
what I think it comes down to
is a question of, not only having information of what's going on,
but paying attention to that
and letting that shift our motivation
to become more sincere
and genuinely positive.
We have hear, this week,
about the horrible sufferings, for example,
that so many women of the world
are enduring day-to-day.
We have that information,
but what often happens to us
is that we don't really choose to pay attention to it.
We don't really choose to allow that
to cause there to be a shift in our hearts.
So I think the way forward for the world --
one that will bring the path of outer development
in harmony
with the real root of happiness --
is that we allow
the information that we have
to really make a change in our heart.
TD: So I think that sincere motivation
is very important for our future well-being,
or deep sense of well-being as humans,
and I think that means sinking in
to whatever it is you're doing now.
Whatever work you're trying to do now to benefit the world,
sink into that,
get a full taste of that.
TD: So, since we've been here this week,
we've taken millions of breaths, collectively,
and perhaps we haven't witnessed
any course changes
happening in our lives,
but we often miss the very subtle changes.
And I think
that sometimes we develop
grand concepts
of what happiness
might look like for us,
but that, if we pay attention,
we can see that there are little symbols of happiness
in every breath that we take.
TD: So, every one of you who has come here
is so talented,
and you have so much to offer to the world,
I think it would be a good note to conclude on then
to just take a moment
to appreciate how fortunate we are
to have come together in this way and exchanged ideas
and really form a strong aspiration
and energy within ourselves
that we will take the good
that has come from this conference,
the momentum, the positivity,
and we will spread that and plant it
in all of the corners of the world.
His Holiness the Karmapa: Tomorrow is my Talk.
TD: Lakshmi has worked incredibly hard,
even in inviting me,
let alone everything else that she has done
to make this happen,
and I was somewhat resistant at times,
and I was also very nervous throughout this week.
I was feeling under the weather and dizzy and so forth,
and people would ask me, why.
I would tell them, "It's because I have to talk tomorrow."
And so Lakshmi had to put up with me through all of that,
but I very much appreciate
the opportunity she's given me
to be here.
And to you, everyone, thank you very much.
(Applause)
HH: Thank you very much.
(Applause)
I want to talk to you
about the future of medicine.
But before I do that, I want to talk
a little bit about the past.
Now, throughout much
of the recent history of medicine,
we've thought about illness and treatment
in terms of a profoundly simple model.
In fact, the model is so simple
that you could summarize it in six words:
have disease, take pill, kill something.
Now, the reason
for the dominance of this model
is of course the antibiotic revolution.
Many of you might not know this,
but we happen to be celebrating
the hundredth year of the introduction
of antibiotics into the United States.
But what you do know
is that that introduction
was nothing short of transformative.
Here you had a chemical,
either from the natural world
or artificially synthesized
in the laboratory,
and it would course through your body,
it would find its target,
lock into its target --
a microbe or some part of a microbe --
and then turn off a lock and a key
with exquisite deftness,
exquisite specificity.
And you would end up taking
a previously fatal, lethal disease --
a pneumonia, syphilis, tuberculosis --
and transforming that
into a curable, or treatable illness.
You have a pneumonia,
you take penicillin,
you kill the microbe
and you cure the disease.
So seductive was this idea,
so potent the metaphor of lock and key
and killing something,
that it really swept through biology.
It was a transformation like no other.
And we've really spent the last 100 years
trying to replicate that model
over and over again
in noninfectious diseases,
in chronic diseases like diabetes
and hypertension and heart disease.
And it's worked,
but it's only worked partly.
Let me show you.
You know, if you take the entire universe
of all chemical reactions
in the human body,
every chemical reaction
that your body is capable of,
most people think that that number
is on the order of a million.
Let's call it a million.
And now you ask the question,
what number or fraction of reactions
can actually be targeted
by the entire pharmacopoeia,
all of medicinal chemistry?
That number is 250.
The rest is chemical darkness.
In other words, 0.025 percent
of all chemical reactions in your body
are actually targetable
by this lock and key mechanism.
You know, if you think
about human physiology
as a vast global telephone network
with interacting nodes
and interacting pieces,
then all of our medicinal chemistry
is operating on one tiny corner
at the edge, the outer edge,
of that network.
It's like all of our
pharmaceutical chemistry
is a pole operator in Wichita, Kansas
who is tinkering with about
10 or 15 telephone lines.
So what do we do about this idea?
What if we reorganized this approach?
In fact, it turns out
that the natural world
gives us a sense of how one
might think about illness
in a radically different way,
rather than disease, medicine, target.
In fact, the natural world
is organized hierarchically upwards,
not downwards, but upwards,
and we begin with a self-regulating,
semi-autonomous unit called a cell.
These self-regulating,
semi-autonomous units
give rise to self-regulating,
semi-autonomous units called organs,
and these organs coalesce
to form things called humans,
and these organisms
ultimately live in environments,
which are partly self-regulating
and partly semi-autonomous.
What's nice about this scheme,
this hierarchical scheme
building upwards rather than downwards,
is that it allows us
to think about illness as well
in a somewhat different way.
Take a disease like cancer.
Since the 1950s,
we've tried rather desperately to apply
this lock and key model to cancer.
We've tried to kill cells
using a variety of chemotherapies 
or targeted therapies,
and as most of us know, that's worked.
It's worked for diseases like leukemia.
It's worked for some forms
of breast cancer,
but eventually you run
to the ceiling of that approach.
And it's only in the last 10 years or so
that we've begun to think
about using the immune system,
remembering that in fact the cancer cell
doesn't grow in a vacuum.
It actually grows in a human organism.
And could you use the organismal capacity,
the fact that human beings
have an immune system, to attack cancer?
In fact, it's led to the some of the most
spectacular new medicines in cancer.
And finally there's the level
of the environment, isn't there?
You know, we don't think of cancer
as altering the environment.
But let me give you an example
of a profoundly carcinogenic environment.
It's called a prison.
You take loneliness, you take depression,
you take confinement,
and you add to that,
rolled up in a little
white sheet of paper,
one of the most potent neurostimulants
that we know, called nicotine,
and you add to that one of the most potent
addictive substances that you know,
and you have
a pro-carcinogenic environment.
But you can have anti-carcinogenic
environments too.
There are attempts to create milieus,
change the hormonal milieu
for breast cancer, for instance.
We're trying to change the metabolic
milieu for other forms of cancer.
Or take another disease, like depression.
Again, working upwards,
since the 1960s and 1970s,
we've tried, again, desperately
to turn off molecules
that operate between nerve cells --
serotonin, dopamine --
and tried to cure depression that way,
and that's worked,
but then that reached the limit.
And we now know that what you
really probably need to do
is to change the physiology
of the organ, the brain,
rewire it, remodel it,
and that, of course,
we know study upon study has shown
that talk therapy does exactly that,
and study upon study
has shown that talk therapy
combined with medicines, pills,
really is much more effective
than either one alone.
Can we imagine a more immersive
environment that will change depression?
Can you lock out the signals
that elicit depression?
Again, moving upwards along this
hierarchical chain of organization.
What's really at stake perhaps here
is not the medicine itself but a metaphor.
Rather than killing something,
in the case of the great
chronic degenerative diseases --
kidney failure, diabetes,
hypertension, osteoarthritis --
maybe what we really need to do is change
the metaphor to growing something.
And that's the key, perhaps,
to reframing our thinking about medicine.
Now, this idea of changing,
of creating a perceptual
shift, as it were,
came home to me to roost in a very
personal manner about 10 years ago.
About 10 years ago --
I've been a runner most of my life --
I went for a run, a Saturday morning run,
I came back and woke up
and I basically couldn't move.
My right knee was swollen up,
and you could hear that ominous crunch
of bone against bone.
And one of the perks of being a physician
is that you get to order your own MRIs.
And I had an MRI the next week,
and it looked like that.
Essentially, the meniscus of cartilage
that is between bone
had been completely torn
and the bone itself had been shattered.
Now, if you're looking at me
and feeling sorry,
let me tell you a few facts.
If I was to take an MRI
of every person in this audience,
60 percent of you would show signs
of bone degeneration
and cartilage degeneration like this.
85 percent of all women by the age of 70
would show moderate to severe
cartilage degeneration.
50 to 60 percent
of the men in this audience
would also have such signs.
So this is a very common disease.
Well, the second perk of being a physician
is that you can get
to experiment on your own ailments.
So about 10 years ago we began,
we brought this process
into the laboratory,
and we began to do simple experiments,
mechanically trying
to fix this degeneration.
We tried to inject chemicals
into the knee spaces of animals
to try to reverse cartilage degeneration,
and to put a short summary
on a very long and painful process,
essentially it came to naught.
Nothing happened.
And then about seven years ago,
we had a research student from Australia.
The nice thing about Australians
is that they're habitually used to
looking at the world upside down.
(Laughter)
And so Dan suggested to me, "You know,
maybe it isn't a mechanical problem.
Maybe it isn't a chemical problem.
Maybe it's a stem cell problem."
In other words, he had two hypotheses.
Number one, there is such a thing
as a skeletal stem cell --
a skeletal stem cell that builds up
the entire vertebrate skeleton,
bone, cartilage and the fibrous
elements of skeleton,
just like there's a stem cell in blood,
just like there's a stem cell
in the nervous system.
And two, that maybe that, the degeneration
or dysfunction of this stem cell
is what's causing osteochondral arthritis,
a very common ailment.
So really the question was,
were we looking for a pill
when we should have really
been looking for a cell.
So we switched our models,
and now we began
to look for skeletal stem cells.
And to cut again a long story short,
about five years ago,
we found these cells.
They live inside the skeleton.
Here's a schematic and then
a real photograph of one of them.
The white stuff is bone,
and these red columns that you see
and the yellow cells
are cells that have arisen
from one single skeletal stem cell --
columns of cartilage, columns of bone
coming out of a single cell.
These cells are fascinating.
They have four properties.
Number one is that they live
where they're expected to live.
They live just underneath
the surface of the bone,
underneath cartilage.
You know, in biology,
it's location, location, location.
And they move into the appropriate areas
and form bone and cartilage.
That's one.
Here's an interesting property.
You can take them out
of the vertebrate skeleton,
you can culture them
in petri dishes in the laboratory,
and they are dying to form cartilage.
Remember how we couldn't
form cartilage for love or money?
These cells are dying to form cartilage.
They form their own furls
of cartilage around themselves.
They're also, number three,
the most efficient repairers
of fractures that we've ever encountered.
This is a little bone,
a mouse bone that we fractured
and then let it heal by itself.
These stem cells have come in
and repaired, in yellow, the bone,
in white, the cartilage,
almost completely.
So much so that if you label them
with a fluorescent dye
you can see them like some kind
of peculiar cellular glue
coming into the area of a fracture,
fixing it locally
and then stopping their work.
Now, the fourth one is the most ominous,
and that is that their numbers
decline precipitously,
precipitously, tenfold,
fiftyfold, as you age.
And so what had happened, really,
is that we found ourselves
in a perceptual shift.
We had gone hunting for pills
but we ended up finding theories.
And in some ways
we had hooked ourselves
back onto this idea:
cells, organisms, environments,
because we were now thinking
about bone stem cells,
we were thinking about arthritis
in terms of a cellular disease.
And then the next question was,
are there organs?
Can you build this
as an organ outside the body?
Can you implant cartilage
into areas of trauma?
And perhaps most interestingly,
can you ascend right up
and create environments?
You know, we know
that exercise remodels bone,
but come on, none of us
is going to exercise.
So could you imagine ways of passively
loading and unloading bone
so that you can recreate
or regenerate degenerating cartilage?
And perhaps more interesting,
and more importantly,
the question is, can you apply this model
more globally outside medicine?
What's at stake, as I said before,
is not killing something,
but growing something.
And it raises a series of, I think,
some of the most interesting questions
about how we think
about medicine in the future.
Could your medicine
be a cell and not a pill?
How would we grow these cells?
What we would we do to stop
the malignant growth of these cells?
We heard about the problems
of unleashing growth.
Could we implant
suicide genes into these cells
to stop them from growing?
Could your medicine be an organ
that's created outside the body
and then implanted into the body?
Could that stop some of the degeneration?
What if the organ needed to have memory?
In cases of diseases of the nervous system
some of those organs had memory.
How could we implant
those memories back in?
Could we store these organs?
Would each organ have to be developed
for an individual human being
and put back?
And perhaps most puzzlingly,
could your medicine be an environment?
Could you patent an environment?
You know, in every culture,
shamans have been using
environments as medicines.
Could we imagine that for our future?
I've talked a lot about models.
I began this talk with models.
So let me end with some thoughts
about model building.
That's what we do as scientists.
You know, when an architect
builds a model,
he or she is trying to show you
a world in miniature.
But when a scientist is building a model,
he or she is trying to show you
the world in metaphor.
He or she is trying to create
a new way of seeing.
The former is a scale shift.
The latter is a perceptual shift.
Now, antibiotics created
such a perceptual shift
in our way of thinking about medicine
that it really colored, distorted,
very successfully, the way we've thought
about medicine for the last hundred years.
But we need new models
to think about medicine in the future.
That's what's at stake.
You know, there's
a popular trope out there
that the reason we haven't had
the transformative impact
on the treatment of illness
is because we don't have
powerful-enough drugs,
and that's partly true.
But perhaps the real reason is
that we don't have powerful-enough
ways of thinking about medicines.
It's certainly true that
it would be lovely to have new medicines.
But perhaps what's really at stake
are three more intangible M's:
mechanisms, models, metaphors.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Chris Anderson:
I really like this metaphor.
How does it link in?
There's a lot of talk in technologyland
about the personalization of medicine,
that we have all this data
and that medical treatments of the future
will be for you specifically,
your genome, your current context.
Does that apply to this model
you've got here?
Siddhartha Mukherjee:
It's a very interesting question.
We've thought about
personalization of medicine
very much in terms of genomics.
That's because the gene
is such a dominant metaphor,
again, to use that same word,
in medicine today,
that we think the genome will drive
the personalization of medicine.
But of course the genome
is just the bottom
of a long chain of being, as it were.
That chain of being, really the first
organized unit of that, is the cell.
So, if we are really going to deliver
in medicine in this way,
we have to think of personalizing
cellular therapies,
and then personalizing
organ or organismal therapies,
and ultimately personalizing
immersion therapies for the environment.
So I think at every stage, you know --
there's that metaphor,
there's turtles all the way.
Well, in this, there's
personalization all the way.
CA: So when you say
medicine could be a cell
and not a pill,
you're talking about
potentially your own cells.
SM: Absolutely.
CA: So converted to stem cells,
perhaps tested against all kinds
of drugs or something, and prepared.
SM: And there's no perhaps.
This is what we're doing.
This is what's happening,
and in fact, we're slowly moving,
not away from genomics,
but incorporating genomics
into what we call multi-order,
semi-autonomous, self-regulating systems,
like cells, like organs,
like environments.
CA: Thank you so much.
SM: Pleasure. Thanks.
To avoid dangerous climate change,
we're going to need
to cut emissions rapidly.
That should be a pretty
uncontentious statement,
certainly with this audience.
But here's something
that's slightly more contentious:
it's not going to be enough.
We will munch our way through
our remaining carbon budget
for one and a half degrees
in a few short years,
and the two degree budget
in about two decades.
We need to not only cut emissions
extremely rapidly,
we also need to take carbon dioxide
out of the atmosphere.
Thank you.
(Laughter)
I work assessing a whole range
of these proposed techniques
to see if they can work.
We could use plants to take CO2 out,
and then store it in trees,
in the soil, deep underground
or in the oceans.
We could build large machines,
so-called artificial trees,
that will scrub CO2 from the air.
For these ideas to be feasible,
we need to understand
whether they can be applied
at a vast scale in a way that is safe,
economic and socially acceptable.
All of these ideas come with tradeoffs.
None of them are perfect,
but many have potential.
It's unlikely that any one of them
will solve it on its own.
There is no silver bullet,
but potentially together,
they may form the silver buckshot
that we need to stop
climate change in its tracks.
I'm working independently
on one particular idea
which uses natural gas
to generate electricity
in a way that takes
carbon dioxide out of the air.
Huh? How does that work?
So the Origen Power Process
feeds natural gas into a fuel cell.
About half the chemical energy
is converted into electricity,
and the remainder into heat,
which is used to break down limestone
into lime and carbon dioxide.
Now at this point, you're probably
thinking that I'm nuts.
It's actually generating carbon dioxide.
But the key point is,
all of the carbon dioxide generated,
both from the fuel cell
and from the lime kiln, is pure,
and that's really important,
because it means you can
either use that carbon dioxide
or you can store it away
deep underground at low cost.
And then the lime that you produce
can be used in industrial processes,
and in being used,
it scrubs CO2 out of the air.
Overall, the process is carbon negative.
It removes carbon dioxide from the air.
If you normally generate
electricity from natural gas,
you emit about 400 grams
of CO2 into the air
for every kilowatt-hour.
With this process,
that figure is minus 600.
At the moment, power
generation is responsible
for about a quarter
of all carbon dioxide emissions.
Hypothetically, if you replaced
all power generation with this process,
then you would not only eliminate all
of the emissions from power generation
but you would start removing emissions
from other sectors as well,
potentially cutting 60 percent
of overall carbon emissions.
You could even use the lime
to add it directly to seawater
to counteract ocean acidification,
one of the other issues that is caused
by CO2 in the atmosphere.
In fact, you get more bang for your buck.
You absorb about twice as much
carbon dioxide when you add it to seawater
as when you use it industrially.
But this is where it gets
really complicated.
While counteracting ocean
acidification is a good thing,
we don't fully understand
what the environmental consequences are,
and so we need to assess
whether this treatment
is actually better than the disease
that it is seeking to cure.
We need to put in place
step-by-step governance
for experiments to assess this safely.
And the scale:
to avoid dangerous climate change,
we are going to need
to remove trillions --
and yes, that's trillions with a T --
trillions of tons of carbon dioxide
from the atmosphere in the decades ahead.
It will cost a few percent of GDP --
think defense-sized expenditure,
lots of industrial activity
and inevitably harmful side effects.
But if the scale seems enormous,
it is only because
of the scale of the problem
that we are seeking to solve.
It's enormous as well.
We can no longer avoid
these thorny issues.
We face risks whichever way we turn:
a world changed by climate change
or a world changed by climate change
and our efforts to counter climate change.
Would that it were not so,
but we can no longer afford
to close our eyes, block our ears,
and say la-la-la.
We need to grow up and face
the consequences of our actions.
(Applause)
Does talk of curing climate change
undermine the will to cut emissions?
This is a real concern,
so we need to emphasize the paramount
importance of reducing emissions
and how speculative these ideas are.
But having done so,
we still need to examine them.
Can we cure climate change?
I don't know, but we certainly
can't if we don't try.
We need ambition without arrogance.
We need the ambition
to restore the atmosphere,
to draw down carbon dioxide
back to a level that is compatible
with a stable climate and healthy oceans.
This will be an enormous undertaking.
You could describe it
as a cathedral project.
Those involved at the outset
may draft the plans
and dig the foundations,
but they will not raise the spire
to its full height.
That task, that privilege,
belongs to our descendants.
None of us will see that day,
but we must start in the hope
that future generations
will be able to finish the job.
So, do you want to change the world?
I don't.
I do not seek the change the world,
but rather keep it as it's meant to be.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Chris Anderson: Thanks. I just want
to ask you a couple of other questions.
Tell us a bit more about this idea
of putting lime in the ocean.
I mean, on the face of it,
it's pretty compelling --
anti-ocean acidification --
and it absorbs more CO2.
You talked about,
we need to do an experiment on this.
What would a responsible
experiment look like?
Tim Kruger: So I think you need to do
a series of experiments,
but you need to do them
just very small stage-by-stage.
In the same way,
when you're trialing a new drug,
you wouldn't just go
into human trials straight off.
You would do a small experiment.
And so the first things to do
are experiments entirely on land,
in special containers,
away from the environment.
And then once you are confident
that that can be done safely,
you move to the next stage.
If you're not confident, you don't.
But step by step.
CA: And who would fund such experiments?
Because they kind of impact
the whole planet at some level.
Is that why nothing is happening on this?
TK: So I think you can do small-scale
experiments in national waters,
and then it's probably the requirement
of national funders to do that.
But ultimately, if you wanted
to counter ocean acidification in this way
on a global scale,
you would need to do it
in international waters,
and then you would need to have
an international community working on it.
CA: Even in national waters,
you know, the ocean's all connected.
That lime is going to get out there.
And people feel outraged
about doing experiments on the planet,
as we've heard.
How do you counter that?
TK: I think you touch on something
which is really important.
It's about a social license to operate.
And I think it may be
that it is impossible to do,
but we need to have the courage to try,
to move this forward,
to see what we can do,
and to engage openly.
And we need to engage with people
in a transparent way.
We need to ask them beforehand.
And I think if we ask them,
we have to be open to the possibility
that the answer will come back,
"No, don't do it."
CA: Thanks so much.
That was really fascinating.
TK: Thank you. (Applause)
Today I have just one request.
Please don't tell me I'm normal.
Now I'd like to introduce you to my brothers.
Remi is 22,
tall and very handsome.
He's speechless, but he communicates joy
in a way that some of the best orators cannot.
Remi knows what love is.
He shares it unconditionally and he shares it regardless.
He's not greedy. He doesn't see skin color.
He doesn't care about religious differences, and get this:
He has never told a lie.
When he sings songs from our childhood,
attempting words that not even I could remember,
he reminds me of one thing:
how little we know about the mind, and how wonderful
the unknown must be.
Samuel is 16. He's tall. He's very handsome.
He has the most impeccable memory.
He has a selective one, though.
He doesn't remember if he stole my chocolate bar,
but he remembers the year of release for every song on my iPod,
conversations we had when he was four,
weeing on my arm on the first ever episode of Teletubbies,
and Lady Gaga's birthday.
Don't they sound incredible?
But most people don't agree.
And in fact, because their minds don't fit
into society's version of normal,
they're often bypassed and misunderstood.
But what lifted my heart and strengthened my soul
was that even though this was the case,
although they were not seen as ordinary,
this could only mean one thing:
that they were extraordinary --
autistic and extraordinary.
Now, for you who may be less familiar with the term "autism,"
it's a complex brain disorder that affects social communication,
learning and sometimes physical skills.
It manifests in each individual differently,
hence why Remi is so different from Sam.
And across the world, every 20 minutes, one new person
is diagnosed with autism, and although it's one of
the fastest-growing developmental disorders in the world,
there is no known cause or cure.
And I cannot remember the first moment I encountered autism,
but I cannot recall a day without it.
I was just three years old when my brother came along,
and I was so excited that
I had a new being in my life.
And after a few months went by,
I realized that he was different.
He screamed a lot.
He didn't want to play like the other babies did,
and in fact, he didn't seem
very interested in me whatsoever.
Remi lived and reigned in his own world, with his own rules,
and he found pleasure in the smallest things,
like lining up cars around the room
and staring at the washing machine
and eating anything that came in between.
And as he grew older, he grew more different,
and the differences became more obvious.
Yet beyond the tantrums and the frustration
and the never-ending hyperactivity
was something really unique:
a pure and innocent nature, a boy who saw the world
without prejudice, a human who had never lied.
Extraordinary.
Now, I cannot deny that there have been
some challenging moments in my family,
moments where I've wished that they were just like me.
But I cast my mind back to the things that they've taught me
about individuality and communication and love,
and I realize that these are things that
I wouldn't want to change with normality.
Normality overlooks the beauty that differences give us,
and the fact that we are different doesn't mean that one of us is wrong.
It just means that there's a different kind of right.
And if I could communicate just one thing to Remi
and to Sam
and to you,
it would be that you don't have to be normal.
You can be extraordinary.
Because autistic or not,
the differences that we have --
We've got a gift! Everyone's got a gift inside of us,
and in all honesty, the pursuit of normality
is the ultimate sacrifice of potential.
The chance for greatness, for progress and for change
dies the moment we try to be like someone else.
Please -- don't tell me I'm normal.
Thank you. (Applause)
(Applause)
(Music)
Sun shining up above
down here it's 10 below
I'm moving on to a place now
where the streets are paved with gold
There'll be two trains running --
running side by side
Some trains are going out
Two trains running --
running side by side
I'm going to catch that fast express train
to my reward in the sky
Many rooms in my father's house now --
Oh Lord there's one for you and me
Many rooms in my father's house now --
Oh there's one for you and me
No blues and no trouble
Oh my Lord sweet Jesus victory
There's one glory from the moon --
Lord another, oh another from the sun
Oh one glory from the moon
and another from the sun
Behind I'll leave this earthly body
when my Lord king Jesus comes
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
Thank you very much, Chris. Everybody who came up here
said they were scared. I don't know if I'm scared,
but this is my first time of addressing an audience like this.
And I don't have any smart technology for you to look at.
There are no slides, so you'll just have to be content with me.
(Laughter)
What I want to do this morning is share with you a couple of stories
and talk about a different Africa.
Already this morning there were some allusions to the Africa
that you hear about all the time: the Africa of HIV/AIDS,
the Africa of malaria, the Africa of poverty, the Africa of conflict,
and the Africa of disasters.
While it is true that those things are going on,
there's an Africa that you don't hear about very much.
And sometimes I'm puzzled, and I ask myself why.
This is the Africa that is changing, that Chris alluded to.
This is the Africa of opportunity.
This is the Africa where people want to take charge of
their own futures and their own destinies.
And this is the Africa where people are looking for partnerships
to do this. That's what I want to talk about today.
And I want to start by telling you
a story about that change in Africa.
On 15th of September 2005, Mr. Diepreye Alamieyeseigha,
a governor of one of the oil-rich states of Nigeria,
was arrested by the London Metropolitan Police on a visit to London.
He was arrested because there were transfers of eight million dollars
that went into some dormant accounts
that belonged to him and his family.
This arrest occurred because there was cooperation
between the London Metropolitan Police
and the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission of Nigeria --
led by one of our most able and courageous people: Mr. Nuhu Ribadu.
Alamieyeseigha was arraigned in London.
Due to some slip-ups, he managed to escape dressed as a woman
and ran from London back to Nigeria where,
according to our constitution, those in office
as governors, president -- as in many countries --
have immunity and cannot be prosecuted. But what happened:
people were so outraged by this behavior that it was possible
for his state legislature to impeach him and get him out of office.
Today, Alams -- as we call him for short -- is in jail.
This is a story about the fact that people in Africa
are no longer willing to tolerate corruption from their leaders.
This is a story about the fact that people want their resources
managed properly for their good, and not taken out to places
where they'll benefit just a few of the elite.
And therefore, when you hear about the corrupt Africa --
corruption all the time -- I want you to know that the people
and the governments are trying hard to fight this
in some of the countries, and that some successes are emerging.
Does it mean the problem is over? The answer is no.
There's still a long way to go, but that there's a will there.
And that successes are being chalked up on this very important fight.
So when you hear about corruption,
don't just feel that nothing is being done about this --
that you can't operate in any African country
because of the overwhelming corruption. That is not the case.
There's a will to fight, and in many countries, that fight is ongoing
and is being won. In others, like mine,
where there has been a long history of dictatorship in Nigeria,
the fight is ongoing and we have a long way to go.
But the truth of the matter is that this is going on.
The results are showing:
independent monitoring by the World Bank and other organizations
show that in many instances the trend is downwards
in terms of corruption, and governance is improving.
A study by the Economic Commission for Africa showed
a clear trend upwards in governance in 28 African countries.
And let me say just one more thing
before I leave this area of governance.
That is that people talk about corruption, corruption.
All the time when they talk about it
you immediately think about Africa.
That's the image: African countries. But let me say this:
if Alams was able to export eight million dollars into an account in London --
if the other people who had taken money, estimated at
20 to 40 billion now of developing countries' monies
sitting abroad in the developed countries -- if they're able to do this,
what is that? Is that not corruption?
In this country, if you receive stolen goods, are you not prosecuted?
So when we talk about this kind of corruption, let us also think
about what is happening on the other side of the globe --
where the money's going and what can be done to stop it.
I'm working on an initiative now, along with the World Bank,
on asset recovery, trying to do what we can
to get the monies that have been taken abroad --
developing countries' moneys -- to get that sent back.
Because if we can get the 20 billion dollars sitting out there back,
it may be far more for some of these countries
than all the aid that is being put together.
(Applause)
The second thing I want to talk about is the will for reform.
Africans, after -- they're tired, we're tired
of being the subject of everybody's charity and care.
We are grateful, but we know that
we can take charge of our own destinies if we have the will to reform.
And what is happening in many African countries now is a realization
that no one can do it but us. We have to do it.
We can invite partners who can support us, but we have to start.
We have to reform our economies, change our leadership,
become more democratic, be more open to change and to information.
And this is what we started to do
in one of the largest countries on the continent, Nigeria.
In fact, if you're not in Nigeria, you're not in Africa.
I want to tell you that.
(Laughter)
One in four sub-Saharan Africans is Nigerian,
and it has 140 million dynamic people -- chaotic people --
but very interesting people. You'll never be bored.
(Laughter)
What we started to do was to realize
that we had to take charge and reform ourselves.
And with the support of a leader
who was willing, at the time, to do the reforms,
we put forward a comprehensive reform program,
which we developed ourselves.
Not the International Monetary Fund. Not the World Bank,
where I worked for 21 years and rose to be a vice president.
No one can do it for you. You have to do it for yourself.
We put together a program that would, one: get the state
out of businesses it had nothing -- it had no business being in.
The state should not be in the business
of producing goods and services
because it's inefficient and incompetent.
So we decided to privatize many of our enterprises.
(Applause)
We -- as a result, we decided to liberalize many of our markets.
Can you believe that prior to this reform --
which started at the end of 2003, when I left Washington
to go and take up the post of Finance Minister --
we had a telecommunications company that was only able to develop
4,500 landlines in its entire 30-year history?
(Laughter)
Having a telephone in my country was a huge luxury.
You couldn't get it. You had to bribe.
You had to do everything to get your phone.
When President Obasanjo supported and launched
the liberalization of the telecommunications sector,
we went from 4,500 landlines to 32 million GSM lines, and counting.
Nigeria's telecoms market is the second-fastest growing in the world,
after China. We are getting investments of about a billion dollars a year
in telecoms. And nobody knows, except a few smart people.
(Laughter)
The smartest one, first to come in,
was the MTN company of South Africa.
And in the three years that I was Finance Minister,
they made an average of 360 million dollars profit per year.
360 million in a market -- in a country that is a poor country,
with an average per capita income just under 500 dollars per capita.
So the market is there.
When they kept this under wraps, but soon others got to know.
Nigerians themselves began to develop
some wireless telecommunications companies,
and three or four others have come in.
But there's a huge market out there,
and people don't know about it, or they don't want to know.
So privatization is one of the things we've done.
The other thing we've also done is to manage our finances better.
Because nobody's going to help you and support you
if you're not managing your own finances well.
And Nigeria, with the oil sector, had the reputation
of being corrupt and not managing its own public finances well.
So what did we try to do? We introduced a fiscal rule
that de-linked our budget from the oil price.
Before we used to just budget on whatever oil we bring in,
because oil is the biggest, most revenue-earning sector
in the economy: 70 percent of our revenues come from oil.
We de-linked that, and once we did it, we began to budget
at a price slightly lower than the oil price
and save whatever was above that price.
We didn't know we could pull it off; it was very controversial.
But what it immediately did was that the volatility
that had been present in terms of our economic development --
where, even if oil prices were high, we would grow very fast.
When they crashed, we crashed.
And we could hardly even pay anything, any salaries, in the economy.
That smoothened out. We were able to save, just before I left,
27 billion dollars. Whereas -- and this went to our reserves --
when I arrived in 2003, we had seven billion dollars in reserves.
By the time I left, we had gone up to almost 30 billion dollars. And
as we speak now, we have about 40 billion dollars in reserves
due to proper management of our finances.
And that shores up our economy, makes it stable.
Our exchange rate that used to fluctuate all the time
is now fairly stable and being managed so that business people
have a predictability of prices in the economy.
We brought inflation down from 28 percent to about 11 percent.
And we had GDP grow from an average of 2.3 percent the previous decade
to about 6.5 percent now.
So all the changes and reforms we were able to make
have shown up in results that are measurable in the economy.
And what is more important, because we want to get away from oil
and diversify -- and there are so many opportunities
in this one big country, as in many countries in Africa --
what was remarkable is that much of this growth came
not from the oil sector alone, but from non-oil.
Agriculture grew at better than eight percent.
As telecoms sector grew, housing and construction,
and I could go on and on. And this is to illustrate to you that
once you get the macro-economy straightened out,
the opportunities in various other sectors are enormous.
We have opportunities in agriculture, like I said.
We have opportunities in solid minerals. We have a lot of minerals
that no one has even invested in or explored. And we realized
that without the proper legislation to make that possible,
that wouldn't happen. So we've now got a mining code
that is comparable with some of the best in the world.
We have opportunities in housing and real estate.
There was nothing in a country of 140 million people --
no shopping malls as you know them here.
This was an investment opportunity for someone
that excited the imagination of people.
And now, we have a situation in which the businesses in this mall
are doing four times the turnover that they had projected.
So, huge things in construction, real estate,
mortgage markets. Financial services:
we had 89 banks. Too many not doing their real business.
We consolidated them from 89 to 25 banks by requiring
that they increase their capital -- share capital.
And it went from about 25 million dollars to 150 million dollars.
The banks -- these banks are now consolidated, and that strengthening
of the banking system has attracted a lot of investment from outside.
Barclays Bank of the U.K. is bringing in 500 million.
Standard Chartered has brought in 140 million.
And I can go on. Dollars, on and on, into the system.
We are doing the same with the insurance sector.
So in financial services, a great deal of opportunity.
In tourism, in many African countries, a great opportunity.
And that's what many people know East Africa for:
the wildlife, the elephants, and so on.
But managing the tourism market in a way
that can really benefit the people is very important.
So what am I trying to say? I'm trying to tell you
that there's a new wave on the continent.
A new wave of openness and democratization in which, since 2000,
more than two-thirds of African countries have had
multi-party democratic elections.
Not all of them have been perfect, or will be,
but the trend is very clear.
I'm trying to tell you that since the past three years,
the average rate of growth on the continent has moved
from about 2.5 percent to about five percent per annum.
This is better than the performance of many OECD countries.
So it's clear that things are changing.
Conflicts are down on the continent;
from about 12 conflicts a decade ago,
we are down to three or four conflicts --
one of the most terrible, of course, of which is Darfur.
And, you know, you have the neighborhood effect where
if something is going on in one part of the continent,
it looks like the entire continent is affected.
But you should know that this continent is not --
is a continent of many countries, not one country.
And if we are down to three or four conflicts,
it means that there are plenty of opportunities to invest
in stable, growing, exciting economies
where there's plenty of opportunity.
And I want to just make one point about this investment.
The best way to help Africans today
is to help them to stand on their own feet.
And the best way to do that is by helping create jobs.
There's no issue with fighting malaria and putting money in that
and saving children's lives. That's not what I'm saying. That is fine.
But imagine the impact on a family: if the parents can be employed
and make sure that their children go to school,
that they can buy the drugs to fight the disease themselves.
If we can invest in places where you yourselves make money
whilst creating jobs and helping people stand on their own feet,
isn't that a wonderful opportunity? Isn't that the way to go?
And I want to say that some of the best people to invest in
on the continent are the women.
(Applause)
I have a CD here. I'm sorry that I didn't say anything on time.
Otherwise, I would have liked you to have seen this.
It says, "Africa: Open for Business."
And this is a video that has actually won an award
as the best documentary of the year.
Understand that the woman who made it
is going to be in Tanzania, where they're having the session in June.
But it shows you Africans, and particularly African women, who
against all odds have developed businesses, some of them world-class.
One of the women in this video, Adenike Ogunlesi,
making children's clothes --
which she started as a hobby and grew into a business.
Mixing African materials, such as we have,
with materials from elsewhere.
So, she'll make a little pair of dungarees with corduroys,
with African material mixed in. Very creative designs,
has reached a stage where she even had an order from Wal-Mart.
(Laughter)
For 10,000 pieces.
So that shows you that we have people who are capable of doing.
And the women are diligent. They are focused; they work hard.
I could go on giving examples:
Beatrice Gakuba of Rwanda, who opened up a flower business
and is now exporting to the Dutch auction in Amsterdam each morning
and is employing 200 other women and men to work with her.
However, many of these are starved for capital to expand,
because nobody believes outside of our countries
that we can do what is necessary. Nobody thinks in terms of a market.
Nobody thinks there's opportunity.
But I'm standing here saying that those who miss the boat now,
will miss it forever.
So if you want to be in Africa, think about investing.
Think about the Beatrices, think about the Adenikes of this world,
who are doing incredible things, that are bringing them
into the global economy, whilst at the same time making sure
that their fellow men and women are employed,
and that the children in those households get educated
because their parents are earning adequate income.
So I invite you to explore the opportunities.
When you go to Tanzania, listen carefully,
because I'm sure you will hear of the various openings that there will be
for you to get involved in something that will do good
for the continent, for the people and for yourselves.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
I bet all of you are familiar
with this view of the ocean,
but the thing is,
most of the ocean looks nothing like this.
Below the sunlit surface waters,
there's an otherworldly realm
known as the twilight zone.
At 200 to 1,000 meters below the surface,
sunlight is barely a glimmer.
Tiny particles swirl down
through the darkness
while flashes of bioluminescence
give us a clue that
these waters teem with life:
microbes, plankton, fish.
Everything that lives here
has amazing adaptations
for the challenges
of such an extreme environment.
These animals help support
top predators such as whales, tuna,
swordfish and sharks.
There could be 10 times
more fish biomass here
than previously thought.
In fact, maybe more
than all the rest of the ocean combined.
There are countless
undiscovered species in deep waters,
and life in the twilight zone
is intertwined with earth's climate.
Yet the twilight zone
is virtually unexplored.
There are so many things
we still don't know about it.
I think we can change that.
I was drawn to oceanography
by just this kind of challenge.
To me it represents
the perfect intersection
of science, technology and the unknown,
the spark for so many breakthrough
discoveries about life on our planet.
As a college student,
I went on an expedition
across the Atlantic
with a team of scientists
using a high-powered laser
to measure microscopic algae.
The wild thing that happened on that trip
is that we discovered what everyone
who looked before had completely missed:
photosynthetic cells
smaller than anyone thought possible.
We now know those tiny cells
are the most abundant
photosynthetic organisms on earth.
This amazing discovery happened
because we used new technology
to see life in the ocean in a new way.
I am convinced that the discoveries
awaiting us in the twilight zone
will be just as breathtaking.
We know so little about the twilight zone
because it's difficult to study.
It's exceedingly large,
spanning from the Arctic
to the Southern Ocean
and around the globe.
It's different from place to place.
It changes quickly
as the water and animals move.
And it's deep and dark and cold,
and the pressures there are enormous.
What we do know is fascinating.
You may be imagining
huge monsters lurking in the deep sea,
but most of the animals are very small,
like this lantern fish.
And this fierce-looking fish
is called a bristlemouth.
Believe it or not, these are the most
abundant vertebrates on earth
and many are so small
that a dozen could fit in this one tube.
It gets even more interesting,
because small size does not stop them
from being powerful through sheer number.
Deep, penetrating sonar shows us
that the animals form dense layers.
You can see what I mean
by the red and yellow colors
around 400 meters in these data.
So much sound bounces off this layer,
it's been mistaken for the ocean bottom.
But if we look, it can't be,
because the layer is deep during the day,
it rises up at night
and the pattern repeats day after day.
This is actually the largest
animal migration on earth.
It happens around the globe every day,
sweeping through the world's oceans
in a massive living wave
as twilight zone inhabitants
travel hundreds of meters
to surface waters to feed at night
and return to the relative safety
of deeper, darker waters during the day.
These animals and their movements
help connect the surface and deep ocean
in important ways.
The animals feed near the surface,
they bring carbon in their food
into the deep waters,
where some of that carbon can stay behind
and remain isolated from the atmosphere
for hundreds or even thousands of years.
In this way, the migration
may help keep carbon dioxide
out of our atmosphere
and limit the effects
of global warming on our climate.
But we still have many questions.
We don't know which species are migrating,
what they're finding to eat,
who is trying to eat them
or how much carbon
they are able to transport.
So I'm a scientist
who studies life in the ocean.
For me, curiosity about these things
is a powerful driver,
but there's more to the motivation here.
We need to answer these questions
and answer them quickly,
because the twilight zone is under threat.
Factory ships in the open ocean
have been vacuuming up
hundreds of thousands of tons of small,
shrimp-like animals called krill.
The animals are ground into fish meal
to support increasing demands
for aquaculture
and for nutraceuticals such as krill oil.
Industry is on the brink
of deepening fisheries such as these
into the mid-water
in what could start
a kind of twilight zone gold rush
operating outside the reach
of national fishing regulations.
This could have irreversible
global-scale impacts
on marine life and food webs.
We need to get out
ahead of fishing impacts
and work to understand
this critical part of the ocean.
At Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution,
I'm really fortunate to be surrounded
by colleagues who share this passion.
Together, we are ready
to launch a large-scale exploration
of the twilight zone.
We have a plan to begin right away
with expeditions in the North Atlantic,
where we'll tackle the big challenges
of observing and studying
the twilight zone's remarkable diversity.
This kind of multiscale,
multidimensional exploration
means we need to integrate
new technologies.
Let me show you a recent example
that has changed our thinking.
Satellite tracking devices
on animals such as sharks
are now showing us that many top predators
regularly dive deep
into the twilight zone to feed.
And when we map their swimming patterns
and compare them to satellite data,
we find that their feeding hot spots
are linked to ocean currents
and other features.
We used to think these animals
found all of their food in surface waters.
We now believe they depend
on the twilight zone.
But we still need to figure out
how they find the best areas to feed,
what they're eating there
and how much their diets depend
on twilight zone species.
We will also need new technologies
to explore the links with climate.
Remember these particles?
Some of them are produced
by gelatinous animals called salps.
Salps are like superefficient
vacuum cleaners,
slurping up plankton and producing
fast-sinking pellets of poop --
try saying that 10 times fast --
pellets of poop that carry carbon
deep into the ocean.
We sometimes find salps
in enormous swarms.
We need to know where
and when and why and whether
this kind of carbon sink
has a big impact on earth's climate.
To meet these challenges, we will need
to push the limits of technology.
We will deploy cameras
and samplers on smart robots
to patrol the depths and help us track
the secret lives of animals like salps.
We will use advanced sonar
to figure out how many fish
and other animals are down there.
We will sequence DNA from the environment
in a kind of forensic analysis
to figure out which species are there
and what they are eating.
With so much that's still
unknown about the twilight zone,
there's an almost unlimited
opportunity for new discovery.
Just look at these beautiful,
fascinating creatures.
We barely know them.
And imagine how many more
are just down there waiting
for our new technologies to see them.
The excitement level about this
could not be higher on our team
of ocean scientists,
engineers and communicators.
There is also a deep sense of urgency.
We can't turn back the clock
on decades of overfishing
in countless regions of the ocean
that once seemed inexhaustible.
How amazing would it be
to take a different path this time?
The twilight zone
is truly a global commons.
We need to first know and understand it
before we can be responsible stewards
and hope to fish it sustainably.
This is not just a journey for scientists,
it is for all of us,
because the decisions we collectively make
over the next decade
will affect what the ocean looks like
for centuries to come.
Thank you.
(Applause)
I really am honored to be here, and as Chris said,
it's been over 20 years since I started working in Africa.
My first introduction was at the Abidjan airport on a sweaty, Ivory Coast morning.
I had just left Wall Street, cut my hair to look like Margaret Mead,
given away most everything that I owned,
and arrived with all the essentials --
some poetry, a few clothes, and, of course, a guitar --
because I was going to save the world,
and I thought I would just start with the African continent.
But literally within days of arriving I was told, in no uncertain terms,
by a number of West African women, that Africans didn't want saving,
thank you very much, least of all not by me.
I was too young, unmarried, I had no children,
didn't really know Africa, and besides, my French was pitiful.
And so, it was an incredibly painful time in my life,
and yet it really started to give me the humility to start listening.
I think that failure can be an incredibly motivating force as well,
so I moved to Kenya and worked in Uganda,
and I met a group of Rwandan women, who asked me, in 1986,
to move to Kigali to help them start the first microfinance institution there.
And I did, and we ended up naming it Duterimbere,
meaning "to go forward with enthusiasm." And while we were doing it,
I realized that there weren't a lot of businesses that were viable
and started by women, and so maybe I should try to run a business, too.
And so I started looking around, and I heard about a bakery
that was run by 20 prostitutes.
And, being a little intrigued, I went to go meet this group,
and what I found was 20 unwed mothers who were trying to survive.
And it was really the beginning of my understanding the power of language,
and how what we call people so often distances us from them,
and makes them little.
I also found out that the bakery was nothing like a business,
that, in fact, it was a classic charity run by a well-intentioned person,
who essentially spent 600 dollars a month
to keep these 20 women busy making little crafts and baked goods,
and living on 50 cents a day, still in poverty.
So, I made a deal with the women. I said, "Look, we get rid of the charity side,
and we run this as a business and I'll help you."
They nervously agreed. I nervously started, and, of course,
things are always harder than you think they're going to be.
First of all, I thought, well, we need a sales team,
and we clearly aren't the A-Team here,
so let's -- I did all this training.
And the epitome was when I literally marched into the streets
of Nyamirambo, which is the popular quarter of Kigali, with a bucket,
and I sold all these little doughnuts to people,
and I came back, and I was like, "You see?"
And the women said, "You know, Jacqueline, who in Nyamirambo is not going to buy
doughnuts out of an orange bucket from a tall American woman?" And like --
(Laughter) -- it's a good point.
So then I went the whole American way,
with competitions, team and individual. Completely failed,
but over time, the women learnt to sell on their own way.
And they started listening to the marketplace,
and they came back with ideas for cassava chips, and banana chips,
and sorghum bread, and before you knew it,
we had cornered the Kigali market,
and the women were earning three to four times the national average.
And with that confidence surge, I thought, "Well, it's time to create a real bakery,
so let's paint it." And the women said, "That's a really great idea."
And I said, "Well, what color do you want to paint it?" And they said,
"Well, you choose." And I said, "No, no, I'm learning to listen.
You choose. It's your bakery, your street, your country -- not mine."
But they wouldn't give me an answer.
So, one week, two weeks, three weeks went by,
and finally I said, "Well, how about blue?"
And they said, "Blue, blue, we love blue. Let's do it blue."
So, I went to the store, I brought Gaudence, the recalcitrant one of all,
and we brought all this paint and fabric to make curtains,
and on painting day, we all gathered in Nyamirambo,
and the idea was we would paint it white with blue as trim,
like a little French bakery. But that was clearly not as satisfying
as painting a wall of blue like a morning sky.
So, blue, blue, everything became blue.
The walls were blue, the windows were blue,
the sidewalk out front was painted blue.
And Aretha Franklin was shouting "R-E-S-P-E-C-T,"
the women's hips were swaying
and little kids were trying to grab the paintbrushes, but it was their day.
And at the end of it, we stood across the street
and we looked at what we had done, and I said, "It is so beautiful."
And the women said, "It really is."
And I said, "And I think the color is perfect,"
and they all nodded their head, except for Gaudence,
and I said, "What?"
And she said, "Nothing." And I said, "What?"
And she said, "Well, it is pretty, but, you know, our color, really, it is green." And --
(Laughter)
-- I learned then that listening isn't just about patience,
but that when you've lived on charity and dependent your whole life long,
it's really hard to say what you mean.
And, mostly because people never really ask you,
and when they do, you don't really think they want to know the truth.
And so then I learned that listening is not only about waiting,
but it's also learning how better to ask questions.
And so, I lived in Kigali for about two and a half years, doing these two things,
and it was an extraordinary time in my life.
And it taught me three lessons
that I think are so important for us today,
and certainly in the work that I do.
The first is that dignity is more important to the human spirit than wealth.
As Eleni has said, when people gain income, they gain choice,
and that is fundamental to dignity.
But as human beings, we also want to see each other,
and we want to be heard by each other, and we should never forget that.
The second is that traditional charity and aid
are never going to solve the problems of poverty.
I think Andrew pretty well covered that, so I will move to the third point,
which is that markets alone also
are not going to solve the problems of poverty.
Yes, we ran this as a business,
but someone needed to pay the philanthropic support
that came into the training, and the management support, the strategic advice
and, maybe most important of all,
the access to new contacts, networks and new markets.
And so, on a micro level, there's a real role for this combination
of investment and philanthropy.
And on a macro level -- some of the speakers have inferred that
even health should be privatized.
But, having had a father with heart disease,
and realizing that what our family could afford
was not what he should have gotten,
and having a good friend step in to help,
I really believe that all people deserve access to health
at prices they can afford.
I think the market can help us figure that out,
but there's got to be a charitable component,
or I don't think we're going to create the kind of societies we want to live in.
And so, it was really those lessons that made me decide to
build Acumen Fund about six years ago.
It's a nonprofit, venture capital fund for the poor,
a few oxymorons in one sentence.
It essentially raises charitable funds from individuals, foundations and corporations,
and then we turn around and we invest equity and loans
in both for-profit and nonprofit entities
that deliver affordable health, housing, energy, clean water
to low income people in South Asia and Africa,
so that they can make their own choices.
We've invested about 20 million dollars in 20 different enterprises,
and have, in so doing, created nearly 20,000 jobs,
and delivered tens of millions of services to people
who otherwise would not be able to afford them.
I want to tell you two stories. Both of them are in Africa.
Both of them are about investing in entrepreneurs
who are committed to service, and who really know the markets.
Both of them live at the confluence of public health and enterprise,
and both of them, because they're manufacturers,
create jobs directly, and create incomes indirectly,
because they're in the malaria sector,
and Africa loses about 13 billion dollars a year because of malaria.
And so as people get healthier, they also get wealthier.
The first one is called Advanced Bio-Extracts Limited.
It's a company built in Kenya about seven years ago
by an incredible entrepreneur named Patrick Henfrey and his three colleagues.
These are old-hand farmers
who've gone through all the agricultural ups and downs
in Kenya over the last 30 years.
Now, this plant is an Artemisia plant;
it's the basic component for artemisinin,
which is the best-known treatment for malaria.
It's indigenous to China and the Far East,
but given that the prevalence of malaria is here in Africa,
Patrick and his colleagues said, "Let's bring it here,
because it's a high value-add product."
The farmers get three to four times the yields that they would with maize.
And so, using patient capital -- money that they could raise early on,
that actually got below market returns
and was willing to go the long haul and be combined
with management assistance, strategic assistance --
they've now created a company where they purchase from 7,500 farmers.
So that's about 50,000 people affected.
And I think some of you may have visited --
these farmers are helped by KickStart and TechnoServe,
who help them become more self-sufficient.
They buy it, they dry it and they bring it to this factory,
which was purchased in part by, again, patient capital from Novartis,
who has a real interest in getting the powder
so that they can make Coartem.
Acumen's been working with ABE for the past year, year and a half,
both on looking at a new business plan,
and what does expansion look like, helping with management support
and helping to do term sheets and raise capital.
And I really understood what patient capital meant emotionally
in the last month or so. Because the company was literally
10 days away from proving that the product they produced
was at the world-quality level needed to make Coartem,
when they were in the biggest cash crisis of their history.
And we called all of the social investors we know.
Now, some of these same social investors are really interested in Africa
and understand the importance of agriculture,
and they even helped the farmers.
And even when we explained that if ABE goes away,
all those 7,500 jobs go away too,
we sometimes have this bifurcation between business and the social.
And it's really time we start thinking more creatively about how they can be fused.
So Acumen made not one, but two bridge loans,
and the good news is they did indeed meet world-quality classification and are now
in the final stages of closing a 20-million-dollar round, to move it to the next level,
and I think that this will be one of the more important companies in East Africa.
This is Samuel. He's a farmer.
He was actually living in the Kibera slums
when his father called him and told him about Artemisia and the value-add potential.
So he moved back to the farm, and, long story short,
they now have seven acres under cultivation.
Samuel's kids are in private school,
and he's starting to help other farmers in the area also go into Artemisia production --
dignity being more important than wealth.
The next one, many of you know.
I talked about it a little at Oxford two years ago,
and some of you visited A to Z manufacturing,
which is one of the great, real companies in East Africa.
It's another one that lives at the confluence of health and enterprise.
And this is really a story about a public-private solution
that has really worked.
It started in Japan. Sumitomo had developed a technology
essentially to impregnate a polyethylene-based fiber with organic insecticide,
so you could create a bed net,
a malaria bed net, that would last five years and not need to be re-dipped.
It could alter the vector, but like Artemisia,
it had been produced only in East Asia. And as part of its social responsibility,
Sumitomo said, "Why don't we experiment
with whether we can produce it in Africa, for Africans?"
UNICEF came forward and said, "We'll buy most of the nets,
and then we'll give them away, as part of the global fund's
and the U.N.'s commitment to pregnant women and children, for free."
Acumen came in with the patient capital,
and we also helped to identify the entrepreneur
that we would all partner with here in Africa,
and Exxon provided the initial resin.
Well, in looking around for entrepreneurs,
there was none better that we could find on earth than Anuj Shah,
in A to Z manufacturing company.
It's a 40-year-old company, it understands manufacturing.
It's gone from socialist Tanzania into capitalist Tanzania,
and continued to flourish. It had about 1,000 employees when we first found it.
And so, Anuj took the entrepreneurial risk here in Africa
to produce a public good that was purchased by the aid establishment
to work with malaria.
And, long story short, again, they've been so successful.
In our first year, the first net went off the line in October of 2003.
We thought the hitting-it-out-of-the-box number was 150,000 nets a year.
This year, they are now producing eight million nets a year,
and they employ 5,000 people, 90 percent of whom are women, mostly unskilled.
They're in a joint venture with Sumitomo.
And so, from an enterprise perspective for Africa,
and from a public health perspective, these are real successes.
But it's only half the story if we're really looking at solving problems of poverty,
because it's not long-term sustainable.
It's a company with one big customer.
And if avian flu hits, or for any other reason
the world decides that malaria is no longer as much of a priority, everybody loses.
And so, Anuj and Acumen
have been talking about testing the private sector,
because the assumption that the aid establishment has made is that,
look, in a country like Tanzania,
80 percent of the population makes less than two dollars a day.
It costs, at manufacturing point, six dollars to produce these,
and it costs the establishment another six dollars to distribute it,
so the market price in a free market would be about 12 dollars per net.
Most people can't afford that, so let's give it away free.
And we said, "Well, there's another option.
Let's use the market as the best listening device we have, and
understand at what price people would pay for this, so they get the dignity of choice.
We can start building local distribution,
and actually, it can cost the public sector much less."
And so we came in with a second round of patient capital to A to Z,
a loan as well as a grant, so that A to Z could play with pricing
and listen to the marketplace, and found a number of things.
One, that people will pay different prices,
but the overwhelming number of people will come forth at one dollar per net
and make a decision to buy it.
And when you listen to them, they'll also have a lot to say
about what they like and what they don't like.
And that some of the channels we thought would work didn't work.
But because of this experimentation and iteration that was allowed
because of the patient capital,
we've now found that it costs about a dollar in the private sector
to distribute, and a dollar to buy the net.
So then, from a policy perspective, when you start with the market,
we have a choice.
We can continue going along at 12 dollars a net, and the customer pays zero,
or we could at least experiment with some of it, to charge one dollar a net,
costing the public sector another six dollars a net,
give the people the dignity of choice, and have a distribution system
that might, over time, start sustaining itself.
We've got to start having conversations like this,
and I don't think there's any better way to start than using the market,
but also to bring other people to the table around it.
Whenever I go to visit A to Z, I think of my grandmother, Stella.
She was very much like those women sitting behind the sewing machines.
She grew up on a farm in Austria, very poor,
didn't have very much education.
She moved to the United States, where she met my grandfather,
who was a cement hauler,
and they had nine children. Three of them died as babies.
My grandmother had tuberculosis, and she worked in a sewing machine shop,
making shirts for about 10 cents an hour.
She, like so many of the women I see at A to Z,
worked hard every day, understood what suffering was,
had a deep faith in God, loved her children
and would never have accepted a handout.
But because she had the opportunity of the marketplace,
and she lived in a society that provided the safety
of having access to affordable health and education,
her children and their children were able to live
lives of real purpose and follow real dreams.
I look around at my siblings and my cousins -- and as I said,
there are a lot of us --
and I see teachers and musicians, hedge fund managers, designers.
One sister who makes other people's wishes come true.
And my wish, when I see those women, I meet those farmers,
and I think about all the people across this continent
who are working hard every day,
is that they have that sense of opportunity and possibility,
and that they also can believe and get access to services,
so that their children, too, can live those lives of great purpose.
It shouldn't be that difficult.
But what it takes is a commitment from all of us
to essentially refuse trite assumptions,
get out of our ideological boxes.
It takes investing in those entrepreneurs that are committed
to service as well as to success.
It takes opening your arms, both, wide,
and expecting very little love in return,
but demanding accountability,
and bringing the accountability to the table as well.
And most of all, most of all,
it requires that all of us have the courage and the patience,
whether we are rich or poor, African or non-African,
local or diaspora, left or right,
to really start listening to each other.
Thank you.
(Applause)
One of my favorite parts
of my job at the Gates Foundation
is that I get to travel to the developing world,
and I do that quite regularly.
And when I meet the mothers
in so many of these remote places,
I'm really struck by the things
that we have in common.
They want what we want for our children
and that is for their children to grow up successful,
to be healthy, and to have a successful life.
But I also see lots of poverty,
and it's quite jarring,
both in the scale and the scope of it.
My first trip in India, I was in a person's home
where they had dirt floors, no running water,
no electricity,
and that's really what I see all over the world.
So in short, I'm startled by all the things
that they don't have.
But I am surprised by one thing that they do have:
Coca-Cola.
Coke is everywhere.
In fact, when I travel to the developing world,
Coke feels ubiquitous.
And so when I come back from these trips,
and I'm thinking about development,
and I'm flying home and I'm thinking,
"We're trying to deliver condoms to people or vaccinations,"
you know, Coke's success kind of stops and makes you wonder:
how is it that they can get Coke
to these far-flung places?
If they can do that,
why can't governments and NGOs do the same thing?
And I'm not the first person to ask this question.
But I think, as a community,
we still have a lot to learn.
It's staggering, if you think about Coca-Cola.
They sell 1.5 billion servings
every single day.
That's like every man, woman and child on the planet
having a serving of Coke every week.
So why does this matter?
Well, if we're going to speed up the progress
and go even faster
on the set of Millennium Development Goals that we're set as a world,
we need to learn from the innovators,
and those innovators
come from every single sector.
I feel that, if we can understand
what makes something like Coca-Cola ubiquitous,
we can apply those lessons then for the public good.
Coke's success is relevant,
because if we can analyze it, learn from it,
then we can save lives.
So that's why I took a bit of time to study Coke.
And I think there are really three things
we can take away from Coca-Cola.
They take real-time data
and immediately feed it back into the product.
They tap into local entrepreneurial talent,
and they do incredible marketing.
So let's start with the data.
Now Coke has a very clear bottom line --
they report to a set of shareholders, they have to turn a profit.
So they take the data,
and they use it to measure progress.
They have this very continuous feedback loop.
They learn something, they put it back into the product,
they put it back into the market.
They have a whole team called "Knowledge and Insight."
It's a lot like other consumer companies.
So if you're running Namibia for Coca-Cola,
and you have a 107 constituencies,
you know where every can versus bottle
of Sprite, Fanta or Coke was sold,
whether it was a corner store,
a supermarket or a pushcart.
So if sales start to drop,
then the person can identify the problem
and address the issue.
Let's contrast that for a minute to development.
In development, the evaluation comes
at the very end of the project.
I've sat in a lot of those meetings,
and by then,
it is way too late to use the data.
I had somebody from an NGO
once describe it to me as bowling in the dark.
They said, "You roll the ball, you hear some pins go down.
It's dark, you can't see which one goes down until the lights come on,
and then you an see your impact."
Real-time data
turns on the lights.
So what's the second thing that Coke's good at?
They're good at tapping into
that local entrepreneurial talent.
Coke's been in Africa since 1928,
but most of the time they couldn't reach the distant markets,
because they had a system that was a lot like in the developed world,
which was a large truck rolling down the street.
And in Africa, the remote places,
it's hard to find a good road.
But Coke noticed something --
they noticed that local people were taking the product, buying it in bulk
and then reselling it in these hard-to-reach places.
And so they took a bit of time to learn about that.
And they decided in 1990
that they wanted to start training the local entrepreneurs,
giving them small loans.
They set them up as what they called micro-distribution centers,
and those local entrepreneurs then hire sales people,
who go out with bicycles and pushcarts and wheelbarrows
to sell the product.
There are now some 3,000 of these centers
employing about 15,000 people in Africa.
In Tanzania and Uganda,
they represent 90 percent
of Coke's sales.
Let's look at the development side.
What is it that governments and NGOs
can learn from Coke?
Governments and NGOs
need to tap into that local entrepreneurial talent as well,
because the locals know how to reach
the very hard-to-serve places, their neighbors,
and they know what motivates them to make change.
I think a great example of this
is Ethiopia's new health extension program.
The government noticed in Ethiopia
that many of the people were so far away from a health clinic,
they were over a day's travel away from a health clinic.
So if you're in an emergency situation -- or if you're a mom about to deliver a baby --
forget it, to get to the health care center.
They decided that wasn't good enough,
so they went to India and studied the Indian state of Kerala
that also had a system like this,
and they adapted it for Ethiopia.
And in 2003, the government of Ethiopia
started this new system in their own country.
They trained 35,000 health extension workers
to deliver care directly to the people.
In just five years,
their ratio went from one worker for every 30,000 people
to one worker for every 2,500 people.
Now, think about
how this can change people's lives.
Health extension workers can help with so many things,
whether it's family planning, prenatal care,
immunizations for the children,
or advising the woman to get to the facility on time
for an on-time delivery.
That is having real impact
in a country like Ethiopia,
and it's why you see their child mortality numbers
coming down 25 percent
from 2000 to 2008.
In Ethiopia, there are hundreds of thousands of children living
because of this health extension worker program.
So what's the next step for Ethiopia?
Well, they're already starting talk about this.
They're starting to talk about, "How do you have the health community workers
generate their own ideas?
How do you incent them based on the impact that they're getting
out in those remote villages?"
That's how you tap into local entrepreneurial talent
and you unlock people's potential.
The third component of Coke's success
is marketing.
Ultimately, Coke's success
depends on one crucial fact
and that is that people want
a Coca-Cola.
Now the reason these micro-entrepreneurs
can sell or make a profit
is they have to sell every single bottle in their pushcart or their wheelbarrow.
So, they rely on Coca-Cola
in terms of its marketing,
and what's the secret to their marketing?
Well, it's aspirational.
It is associated that product
with a kind of life that people want to live.
So even though it's a global company,
they take a very local approach.
Coke's global campaign slogan
is "Open Happiness."
But they localize it.
And they don't just guess what makes people happy;
they go to places like Latin America
and they realize that happiness there
is associated with family life.
And in South Africa,
they associate happiness
with seriti or community respect.
Now, that played itself out in the World Cup campaign.
Let's listen to this song that Coke created for it,
"Wavin' Flag" by a Somali hip hop artist.
(Video) K'Naan: ♫ Oh oh oh oh oh o-oh ♫
♫ Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh ♫
♫ Oh oh oh oh oh o-oh ♫
♫ Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh o-oh ♫
♫Give you freedom, give you fire♫
♫ Give you reason, take you higher ♫
♫ See the champions take the field now ♫
♫ You define us, make us feel proud ♫
♫ In the streets our heads are lifted ♫
♫ As we lose our inhibition ♫
♫ Celebration, it's around us ♫
♫ Every nation, all around us ♫
Melinda French Gates: It feels pretty good, right?
Well, they didn't stop there --
they localized it into 18 different languages.
And it went number one on the pop chart
in 17 countries.
It reminds me of a song that I remember from my childhood,
"I'd Like to Teach the World to Sing,"
that also went number one on the pop charts.
Both songs have something in common:
that same appeal
of celebration and unity.
So how does health and development market?
Well, it's based on avoidance,
not aspirations.
I'm sure you've heard some of these messages.
"Use a condom, don't get AIDS."
"Wash you hands, you might not get diarrhea."
It doesn't sound anything like "Wavin' Flag" to me.
And I think we make a fundamental mistake --
we make an assumption,
that we think that, if people need something,
we don't have to make them want that.
And I think that's a mistake.
And there's some indications around the world that this is starting to change.
One example is sanitation.
We know that a million and a half children
die a year from diarrhea
and a lot of it is because of open defecation.
But there's a solution: you build a toilet.
But what we're finding around the world, over and over again,
is, if you build a toilet and you leave it there,
it doesn't get used.
People reuse it for a slab for their home.
They sometimes store grain in it.
I've even seen it used for a chicken coop.
(Laughter)
But what does marketing really entail
that would make a sanitation solution get a result in diarrhea?
Well, you work with the community.
You start to talk to them about why open defecation
is something that shouldn't be done in the village,
and they agree to that.
But then you take the toilet and you position it
as a modern, trendy convenience.
One state in Northern India has gone so far
as to link toilets to courtship.
And it works -- look at these headlines.
(Laughter)
I'm not kidding.
Women are refusing to marry men without toilets.
No loo, no "I do."
(Laughter)
Now, it's not just a funny headline --
it's innovative. It's an innovative marketing campaign.
But more importantly,
it saves lives.
Take a look at this --
this is a room full of young men
and my husband, Bill.
And can you guess what the young men are waiting for?
They're waiting to be circumcised.
Can you you believe that?
We know that circumcision reduces HIV infection
by 60 percent in men.
And when we first heard this result inside the Foundation,
I have to admit, Bill and I were scratching our heads a little bit
and we were saying, "But who's going to volunteer for this procedure?"
But it turns out the men do,
because they're hearing from their girlfriends
that they prefer it,
and the men also believe it improves their sex life.
So if we can start to understand
what people really want
in health and development,
we can change communities
and we can change whole nations.
Well, why is all of this so important?
So let's talk about what happens when this all comes together,
when you tie the three things together.
And polio, I think, is one of the most powerful examples.
We've seen a 99 percent reduction in polio in 20 years.
So if you look back to 1988,
there are about 350,000 cases of polio
on the planet that year.
In 2009, we're down to 1,600 cases.
Well how did that happen?
Let's look at a country like India.
They have over a billion people in this country,
but they have 35,000 local doctors
who report paralysis,
and clinicians, a huge reporting system in chemists.
They have two and a half million vaccinators.
But let me make the story a little bit more concrete for you.
Let me tell you the story of Shriram,
an 18 month boy in Bihar,
a northern state in India.
This year on August 8th, he felt paralysis
and on the 13th, his parents took him to the doctor.
On August 14th and 15th, they took a stool sample,
and by the 25th of August,
it was confirmed he had Type 1 polio.
By August 30th, a genetic test was done,
and we knew what strain of polio Shriram had.
Now it could have come from one of two places.
It could have come from Nepal, just to the north, across the border,
or from Jharkhand, a state just to the south.
Luckily, the genetic testing proved
that, in fact, this strand came north,
because, had it come from the south,
it would have had a much wider impact in terms of transmission.
So many more people would have been affected.
So what's the endgame?
Well on September 4th, there was a huge mop-up campaign,
which is what you do in polio.
They went out and where Shriram lives,
they vaccinated two million people.
So in less than a month,
we went from one case of paralysis
to a targeted vaccination program.
And I'm happy to say only one other person in that area got polio.
That's how you keep
a huge outbreak from spreading,
and it shows what can happen
when local people have the data in their hands;
they can save lives.
Now one of the challenges in polio, still, is marketing,
but it might not be what you think.
It's not the marketing on the ground.
It's not telling the parents,
"If you see paralysis, take your child to the doctor
or get your child vaccinated."
We have a problem with marketing in the donor community.
The G8 nations have been incredibly generous on polio
over the last 20 years,
but we're starting to have something called polio fatigue
and that is that the donor nations
aren't willing to fund polio any longer.
So by next summer, we're sighted to run out of money on polio.
So we are 99 percent
of the way there on this goal
and we're about to run short of money.
And I think that if the marketing were more aspirational,
if we could focus as a community
on how far we've come
and how amazing it would be
to eradicate this disease,
we could put polio fatigue
and polio behind us.
And if we could do that,
we could stop vaccinating everybody, worldwide,
in all of our countries for polio.
And it would only be the second disease ever
wiped off the face of the planet.
And we are so close.
And this victory is so possible.
So if Coke's marketers came to me
and asked me to define happiness,
I'd say my vision of happiness
is a mother holding healthy baby
in her arms.
To me, that is deep happiness.
And so if we can learn lessons from the innovators in every sector,
then in the future we make together,
that happiness
can be just as ubiquitous
as Coca-Cola.
Thank you.
(Applause)
I grew up in New York City,
between Harlem and the Bronx.
Growing up as a boy, we were taught
that men had to be tough, had to be strong,
had to be courageous, dominating --
no pain, no emotions,
with the exception of anger --
and definitely no fear;
that men are in charge,
which means women are not;
that men lead,
and you should just follow and do what we say;
that men are superior; women are inferior;
that men are strong; women are weak;
that women are of less value,
property of men,
and objects,
particularly sexual objects.
I've later come to know that to be
the collective socialization of men,
better known
as the "man box."
See this man box has in it
all the ingredients
of how we define what it means to be a man.
Now I also want to say, without a doubt,
there are some wonderful, wonderful,
absolutely wonderful things
about being a man.
But at the same time,
there's some stuff
that's just straight up twisted,
and we really need to begin
to challenge, look at it
and really get in the process
of deconstructing, redefining,
what we come to know as manhood.
This is my two at home, Kendall and Jay.
They're 11 and 12.
Kendall's 15 months older than Jay.
There was a period of time when my wife -- her name is Tammie -- and I,
we just got real busy and whip, bam, boom:
Kendall and Jay.
(Laughter)
And when they were about five and six,
four and five,
Jay could come to me,
come to me crying.
It didn't matter what she was crying about,
she could get on my knee, she could snot my sleeve up,
just cry, cry it out.
Daddy's got you. That's all that's important.
Now Kendall on the other hand --
and like I said, he's only 15 months older than her --
he'd come to me crying,
it's like as soon as I would hear him cry,
a clock would go off.
I would give the boy probably about 30 seconds,
which means, by the time he got to me,
I was already saying things like, "Why are you crying?
Hold your head up. Look at me.
Explain to me what's wrong.
Tell me what's wrong. I can't understand you.
Why are you crying?"
And out of my own frustration
of my role and responsibility
of building him up as a man
to fit into these guidelines
and these structures that are defining this man box,
I would find myself saying things like,
"Just go in your room.
Just go on, go on in your room.
Sit down,
get yourself together
and come back and talk to me
when you can talk to me like a --" what?
(Audience: Man.)
Like a man.
And he's five years old.
And as I grow in life,
I would say to myself,
"My God, what's wrong with me?
What am I doing? Why would I do this?"
And I think back.
I think back to my father.
There was a time in my life
where we had a very troubled experience in our family.
My brother, Henry, he died tragically
when we were teenagers.
We lived in New York City, as I said.
We lived in the Bronx at the time,
and the burial was in a place called Long Island,
it was about two hours outside of the city.
And as we were preparing
to come back from the burial,
the cars stopped at the bathroom
to let folks take care of themselves
before the long ride back to the city.
And the limousine empties out.
My mother, my sister, my auntie, they all get out,
but my father and I stayed in the limousine,
and no sooner than the women got out,
he burst out crying.
He didn't want cry in front of me,
but he knew he wasn't going to make it back to the city,
and it was better me than to allow himself
to express these feelings and emotions in front of the women.
And this is a man
who, 10 minutes ago,
had just put his teenage son
in the ground --
something I just can't even imagine.
The thing that sticks with me the most
is that he was apologizing to me
for crying in front of me,
and at the same time, he was also giving me props,
lifting me up,
for not crying.
I come to also look at this
as this fear that we have as men,
this fear that just has us paralyzed,
holding us hostage
to this man box.
I can remember speaking
to a 12-year-old boy, a football player,
and I asked him, I said,
"How would you feel if,
in front of all the players,
your coach told you you were playing like a girl?"
Now I expected him to say something like,
I'd be sad; I'd be mad; I'd be angry, or something like that.
No, the boy said to me --
the boy said to me,
"It would destroy me."
And I said to myself,
"God, if it would destroy him
to be called a girl,
what are we then teaching him
about girls?"
(Applause)
It took me back to a time
when I was about 12 years old.
I grew up in tenement buildings in the inner city.
At this time we're living in the Bronx,
and in the building next to where I lived there was a guy named Johnny.
He was about 16 years old,
and we were all about 12 years old -- younger guys.
And he was hanging out with all us younger guys.
And this guy, he was up to a lot of no good.
He was the kind of kid who parents would have to wonder,
"What is this 16-year-old boy doing with these 12-year-old boys?"
And he did spend a lot of time up to no good.
He was a troubled kid.
His mother had died from a heroin overdose.
He was being raised by his grandmother.
His father wasn't on the set.
His grandmother had two jobs.
He was home alone a lot.
But I've got to tell you, we young guys,
we looked up to this dude, man.
He was cool. He was fine.
That's what the sisters said, "He was fine."
He was having sex.
We all looked up to him.
So one day, I'm out in front of the house doing something --
just playing around, doing something -- I don't know what.
He looks out his window; he calls me upstairs; he said, "Hey Anthony."
They called me Anthony growing up as a kid.
"Hey Anthony, come on upstairs."
Johnny call, you go.
So I run right upstairs.
As he opens the door, he says to me, "Do you want some?"
Now I immediately knew what he meant.
Because for me growing up at that time,
and our relationship with this man box,
"Do you want some?" meant one of two things:
sex or drugs --
and we weren't doing drugs.
Now my box, my card,
my man box card,
was immediately in jeopardy.
Two things: One, I never had sex.
We don't talk about that as men.
You only tell your dearest, closest friend, sworn to secrecy for life,
the first time you had sex.
For everybody else, we go around like we've been having sex since we were two.
There ain't no first time.
(Laughter)
The other thing I couldn't tell him is that I didn't want any.
That's even worse. We're supposed to always be on the prowl.
Women are objects,
especially sexual objects.
Anyway, so I couldn't tell him any of that.
So, like my mother would say, make a long story short,
I just simply said to Johnny, "Yes."
He told me to go in his room.
I go in his room. On his bed is a girl from the neighborhood named Sheila.
She's 16 years old.
She's nude.
She's what I know today to be mentally ill,
higher-functioning at times than others.
We had a whole choice of inappropriate names for her.
Anyway, Johnny had just gotten through having sex with her.
Well actually, he raped her, but he would say he had sex with her.
Because, while Sheila never said no,
she also never said yes.
So he was offering me the opportunity to do the same.
So when I go in the room, I close the door.
Folks, I'm petrified.
I stand with my back to the door so Johnny can't bust in the room
and see that I'm not doing anything,
and I stand there long enough that I could have actually done something.
So now I'm no longer trying to figure out what I'm going to do;
I'm trying to figure out how I'm going to get out of this room.
So in my 12 years of wisdom,
I zip my pants down,
I walk out into the room,
and lo and behold to me,
while I was in the room with Sheila,
Johnny was back at the window calling guys up.
So now there's a living room full of guys.
It was like the waiting room in the doctor's office.
And they asked me how was it,
and I say to them, "It was good,"
and I zip my pants up in front of them,
and I head for the door.
Now I say this all with remorse,
and I was feeling a tremendous amount of remorse at that time,
but I was conflicted, because, while I was feeling remorse, I was excited,
because I didn't get caught.
But I knew I felt bad about what was happening.
This fear, getting outside the man box,
totally enveloped me.
It was way more important to me,
about me and my man box card
than about Sheila
and what was happening to her.
See collectively, we as men
are taught to have less value in women,
to view them as property and the objects of men.
We see that as an equation that equals violence against women.
We as men, good men,
the large majority of men,
we operate on the foundation
of this whole collective socialization.
We kind of see ourselves separate, but we're very much a part of it.
You see, we have to come to understand
that less value, property and objectification is the foundation
and the violence can't happen without it.
So we're very much a part of the solution
as well as the problem.
The center for disease control says
that men's violence against women is at epidemic proportions,
is the number one health concern for women
in this country and abroad.
So quickly, I'd like to just say,
this is the love of my life, my daughter Jay.
The world I envision for her --
how do I want men to be acting and behaving?
I need you on board. I need you with me.
I need you working with me and me working with you
on how we raise our sons
and teach them to be men --
that it's okay to not be dominating,
that it's okay to have feelings and emotions,
that it's okay to promote equality,
that it's okay to have women who are just friends and that's it,
that it's okay to be whole,
that my liberation as a man
is tied to your liberation as a woman. (Applause)
I remember asking a nine-year-old boy,
I asked a nine-year-old boy,
"What would life be like for you,
if you didn't have to adhere to this man box?"
He said to me, "I would be free."
Thank you folks.
(Applause)
So, without romanticizing this too much:
imagine that you light your home
with kerosene and candles every night,
and that you do all of your cooking
with charcoal.
This is how the world's
two billion poorest people
cook and light their homes every day.
This isn't just inconvenient,
this is inefficient,
it's expensive,
it's harmful to human health,
harmful to the environment,
and it's unproductive.
And that's energy poverty.
So let me give you a couple of examples.
I work in Haiti,
where about 80% of the population
lives in energy poverty.
The average household
spends 10% of its income
on kerosene for lighting –
that's an order of magnitude greater
than what the average US household spends
on electricity to light their homes.
The 2008 hurricane season in Haiti caused
about one billion dollars in damage.
That was a sixth of their GDP.
The damage was so severe
because the primary energy fuel
in Haiti is charcoal,
which is made from trees,
and has left the country
almost completely deforested.
Without trees, the country can't absorb
heavy rains and massive flooding,
as a result.
So in the industrialized world,
we built walls that protect us
from the externalities of our energy use;
we can afford to clean up acute
environmental disasters;
and we can also afford
to adapt to chronic conditions
like climate change.
That's not the case for Haiti.
They can't afford this.
The only way they're going to lift
themselves out of energy poverty
is by adapting fuels
that are more efficient,
that are less expensive,
that are better for human health,
better for the environment
and that are more productive.
So it turns out that those fuels
and technologies exist,
and this is an example of that.
This is a solar LED lightbulb
that we sell for a retail price
of about 10 dollars in rural Haiti.
That's a payback period
of less than three months
for the average Haitian household.
The prescriptions to solve energy poverty
seems pretty straightforward:
you develop these technologies
that have a great return on investment,
and people should be snatching them up.
But that's not the case.
The first time I ever went down to Haiti
was in August of 2008,
sort of on a whim,
and I was fielding surveys
in the rural south of the country
to assess the extent of energy poverty.
And at night, I would go around sometimes
and I would speak with the street vendors
and see if they were interested
in buying these solar LED lamps.
One woman who I encountered
turned down my offer,
and she said, “Mon chéri,
c'est trop Cher,”
which basically means,
“My dear, it's too expensive.”
But I tried to explain to her,
“Look, this is going to save you
a lot of money,
and it's going to give
you even better light
than what you're using
now with the kerosene.”
So I didn't make the sale,
but I did learn a really important lesson,
which is that technology, products,
were not going to end energy poverty.
Instead, access was going to.
Specifically, there are
two types of access
that are going to end energy poverty:
there's physical access,
and there's financial access.
So, physical access --
what does that mean?
It's very expensive for low-income
households in developing countries
to reach major centers of commerce.
And it's basically impossible for them
to order something off Amazon.com.
“The last mile” is a phrase
that's normally associated
with the telecommunications industry.
It means that last bit
of wire that's necessary
to connect the customer to the provider.
What we need for ending energy poverty
are last-mile retailers
that bring these clean energy
products to the people.
The kerosene and charcoal value chains
already figured this out:
those fuels are ubiquitous
across the entire country.
You can go to the most remote
village in Haiti
and you will find somebody
selling kerosene and charcoal.
So the other type of access: financial.
We all know that clean energy
products, technologies,
tend to be characterized
by higher upfront costs,
but very low operating costs.
And so in the industrialized world,
we have very generous subsidies
that are specifically designed
to bring down those upfront costs.
Those subsidies don't exist in Haiti.
What they do have is microfinance.
But you're going to severely diminish
the value proposition
of your clean energy product
if you expect somebody in Haiti
to go out, get a microloan,
go back to the retailer,
and then buy the clean energy product.
So the prescription to end energy poverty
is much more complicated
than simply products.
We need to integrate financial access
directly into new, innovative
distribution models.
What does that mean?
That means bundling consumer credit
with the retailer.
This is really easy
for Bloomingdale’s to do,
but it's not so easy for a rural
sales agent in Haiti to do.
We need to redirect cash flows
that are going now
from the diaspora in the United States
through Western Union
wire transfers in cash
directly into clean energy products
that can be delivered to or picked up by
their friends or family in Haiti.
So the next time you hear
about a technology or product
that's going to change the world,
be a little bit skeptical.
The inventor Dean Kamen,
the guy who invented the Segway,
a genius by any standards,
once said that his job is easy,
inventing things is easy,
the hard part is the technology
dissemination --
it's getting those
technologies and products
to the people who need it most.
Thank you.
(Applause)
This back here was my brain cancer.
Isn't it nice?
(Laughter)
The key phrase is "was,"
phew.
(Applause)
Having brain cancer was really,
as you can imagine,
shocking news for me.
I knew nothing about cancer.
In Western cultures, when you have cancer,
it's as if you disappear in a way.
Your life as a complex human being
is replaced by medical data:
Your images, your exams, your lab values,
a list of medicines.
And everyone changes as well.
You suddenly become a disease on legs.
Doctors start speaking a language
which you don't understand.
They start pointing their fingers
at your body and your images.
People start changing as well
because they start dealing
with the disease,
instead of with the human being.
They say, "What did the doctor say?"
before even saying, "Hello."
And in the meanwhile,
you're left with questions
to which nobody gives an answer.
These are the "Can I?" questions:
Can I work while I have cancer?
Can I study? Can I make love?
Can I be creative?
And you wonder, "What have I done
to deserve this?"
You wonder, "Can I change something
about my lifestyle?"
You wonder, "Can I do something?
Are there any other options?"
And, obviously, doctors are
the good guys in all these scenarios,
because they are very professional
and dedicated to curing you.
But they also are very used
to having to deal with patients,
so I'd say that they sometimes
lose the idea that this is torture for you
and that you become,
literally, a patient --
"patient" means "the one who waits."
(Laughter)
Things are changing, but classically,
they tend to not engage you in any way
to learn about your condition,
to get your friends and family engaged,
or showing you ways
in which you can change your lifestyle
to minimize the risks
of what you're going through.
But instead, you're forced there to wait
in the hands of a series
of very professional strangers.
While I was in the hospital,
I asked for a printed-out
picture of my cancer
and I spoke with it.
It was really hard to obtain,
because it's not common practice
to ask for a picture of your own cancer.
I talked to it and I said,
"Okay, cancer,
you're not all there is to me.
There's more to me.
A cure, whichever it is, will have
to deal with the whole of me."
And so, the next day, I left the hospital
against medical advice.
I was determined to change
my relationship with the cancer
and I was determined
to learn more about my cancer
before doing anything
as drastic as a surgery.
I'm an artist, I use several forms
of open-source technologies
and open information in my practice.
So my best bet was to get it all
out there, get the information out there,
and use it so that it could be
accessed by anyone.
So I created a website,
which is called La Cura,
on which I put my medical data, online.
I actually had to hack it
and that's a thing which we
can talk about in another speech.
(Laughter)
I chose this word, La Cura --
La Cura in Italian means "the cure" --
because in many different cultures,
the word "cure" can mean
many different things.
In our Western cultures,
it means eradicating
or reversing a disease,
but in different cultures,
for example, a culture from Asia,
from the Mediterranean,
from Latin countries, from Africa,
it can mean many more things.
Of course, I was interested
in the opinions of doctors
and healthcare providers,
but I was also interested in
the cure of the artist, of the poet,
of the designer,
of, who knows, the musicians.
I was interested in the social cure,
I was interested in
the psychological cure,
I was interested in the spiritual cure,
I was interested in the emotional cure,
I was interested in any form of cure.
And, it worked.
The La Cura website went viral.
I received lots of media attention
from Italy and from abroad
and I quickly received
more than 500,000 contacts --
emails, social networking --
most of them were a suggestion
on how to cure my cancer,
but more of them were about
how to cure myself
as a full individual.
For example, many thousands of videos,
images, pictures, art performances
were produced for La Cura.
For example, here we see
Francesca Fini in her performance.
Or, as artist Patrick Lichty has done:
He produced a 3D sculpture of my tumor
and put it on sale on Thingiverse.
Now you can have my cancer, too!
(Laughter)
Which is a nice thing,
if you think about it,
we can share our cancer.
And this was going on --
scientists, the traditional
medicine experts,
several researchers, doctors --
all connected with me to give advice.
With all this information and support,
I was able to form a team
of several neurosurgeons,
traditional doctors,
oncologists, and several
hundred volunteers
with whom I was able to discuss
the information I was receiving,
which is very important.
And together, we were able to form
a strategy for my own cure
in many languages,
according to many cultures.
And the current strategy
spans the whole world
and thousands of years of human history,
which is quite remarkable for me.
[Surgery]
The follow-up MRIs showed, luckily,
little to no growth of the cancer.
So I was able to take my time and choose.
I chose the doctor I wanted to work with,
I chose the hospital I wanted to stay in,
and in the meanwhile, I was supported
by thousands of people,
none of whom felt pity for me.
Everyone felt like they could
take an active role
in helping me to get well,
and this was the most important
part of La Cura.
What are the outcomes?
I'm fine, as you can see, pretty fine.
(Applause)
I had excellent news
after the surgery --
I have -- I had a very low-grade glioma,
which is a "good" kind of cancer
which doesn't grow a lot.
I have completely changed
my life and my lifestyle.
Everything I did was thoughtfully
designed to get me engaged.
Up until the very last few
minutes of the surgery,
which was very intense,
a matrix of electrodes
was implanted in my brain
from this side,
to be able to build a functional map
of what the brain controls.
And right before the operation,
we were able to discuss
the functional map of my brain
with the doctor, to understand
which risks I was running into
and if there were any I wanted to avoid.
Obviously, there were.
[Open]
And this openness was really
the fundamental part of La Cura.
Thousands of people shared
their stories, their experiences.
Doctors got to talk with people
they don't usually consult
when they think about cancer.
I'm a self-founding,
continuous state of translation
among many different languages,
in which science meets emotion
and conventional research
meets traditional research.
[Society]
The most important thing of La Cura
was to feel like a part
of a really engaged and connected society
whose wellness really depends
on the wellness of all of its components.
This global performance
is my open-source cure for cancer.
And from what I feel,
it's a cure for me, but for us all.
Thank you.
(Applause).
So this is my niece.
Her name is Yahli.
She is nine months old.
Her mum is a doctor,
and her dad is a lawyer.
By the time Yahli goes to college,
the jobs her parents do
are going to look dramatically different.
In 2013, researchers at Oxford University
did a study on the future of work.
They concluded that almost one
in every two jobs have a high risk
of being automated by machines.
Machine learning is the technology
that's responsible for most
of this disruption.
It's the most powerful branch
of artificial intelligence.
It allows machines to learn from data
and mimic some of the things
that humans can do.
My company, Kaggle, operates
on the cutting edge of machine learning.
We bring together
hundreds of thousands of experts
to solve important problems
for industry and academia.
This gives us a unique perspective
on what machines can do,
what they can't do
and what jobs they might
automate or threaten.
Machine learning started making its way
into industry in the early '90s.
It started with relatively simple tasks.
It started with things like assessing
credit risk from loan applications,
sorting the mail by reading
handwritten characters from zip codes.
Over the past few years, we have made
dramatic breakthroughs.
Machine learning is now capable
of far, far more complex tasks.
In 2012, Kaggle challenged its community
to build an algorithm
that could grade high-school essays.
The winning algorithms
were able to match the grades
given by human teachers.
Last year, we issued
an even more difficult challenge.
Can you take images of the eye
and diagnose an eye disease
called diabetic retinopathy?
Again, the winning algorithms
were able to match the diagnoses
given by human ophthalmologists.
Now, given the right data,
machines are going to outperform humans
at tasks like this.
A teacher might read 10,000 essays
over a 40-year career.
An ophthalmologist might see 50,000 eyes.
A machine can read millions of essays
or see millions of eyes
within minutes.
We have no chance of competing
against machines
on frequent, high-volume tasks.
But there are things we can do
that machines can't do.
Where machines have made
very little progress
is in tackling novel situations.
They can't handle things
they haven't seen many times before.
The fundamental limitations
of machine learning
is that it needs to learn
from large volumes of past data.
Now, humans don't.
We have the ability to connect
seemingly disparate threads
to solve problems we've never seen before.
Percy Spencer was a physicist
working on radar during World War II,
when he noticed the magnetron
was melting his chocolate bar.
He was able to connect his understanding
of electromagnetic radiation
with his knowledge of cooking
in order to invent -- any guesses? --
the microwave oven.
Now, this is a particularly remarkable
example of creativity.
But this sort of cross-pollination
happens for each of us in small ways
thousands of times per day.
Machines cannot compete with us
when it comes to tackling
novel situations,
and this puts a fundamental limit
on the human tasks
that machines will automate.
So what does this mean
for the future of work?
The future state of any single job lies
in the answer to a single question:
To what extent is that job reducible
to frequent, high-volume tasks,
and to what extent does it involve
tackling novel situations?
On frequent, high-volume tasks,
machines are getting smarter and smarter.
Today they grade essays.
They diagnose certain diseases.
Over coming years,
they're going to conduct our audits,
and they're going to read boilerplate
from legal contracts.
Accountants and lawyers are still needed.
They're going to be needed
for complex tax structuring,
for pathbreaking litigation.
But machines will shrink their ranks
and make these jobs harder to come by.
Now, as mentioned,
machines are not making progress
on novel situations.
The copy behind a marketing campaign
needs to grab consumers' attention.
It has to stand out from the crowd.
Business strategy means
finding gaps in the market,
things that nobody else is doing.
It will be humans that are creating
the copy behind our marketing campaigns,
and it will be humans that are developing
our business strategy.
So Yahli, whatever you decide to do,
let every day bring you a new challenge.
If it does, then you will stay
ahead of the machines.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Automation anxiety
has been spreading lately,
a fear that in the future,
many jobs will be performed by machines
rather than human beings,
given the remarkable advances
that are unfolding
in artificial intelligence and robotics.
What's clear is that
there will be significant change.
What's less clear
is what that change will look like.
My research suggests that the future
is both troubling and exciting.
The threat of technological
unemployment is real,
and yet it's a good problem to have.
And to explain
how I came to that conclusion,
I want to confront three myths
that I think are currently obscuring
our vision of this automated future.
A picture that we see
on our television screens,
in books, in films, in everyday commentary
is one where an army of robots
descends on the workplace
with one goal in mind:
to displace human beings from their work.
And I call this the Terminator myth.
Yes, machines displace
human beings from particular tasks,
but they don't just
substitute for human beings.
They also complement them in other tasks,
making that work more valuable
and more important.
Sometimes they complement
human beings directly,
making them more productive
or more efficient at a particular task.
So a taxi driver can use a satnav system
to navigate on unfamiliar roads.
An architect can use
computer-assisted design software
to design bigger,
more complicated buildings.
But technological progress doesn't
just complement human beings directly.
It also complements them indirectly,
and it does this in two ways.
The first is if we think
of the economy as a pie,
technological progress
makes the pie bigger.
As productivity increases,
incomes rise and demand grows.
The British pie, for instance,
is more than a hundred times
the size it was 300 years ago.
And so people displaced
from tasks in the old pie
could find tasks to do
in the new pie instead.
But technological progress
doesn't just make the pie bigger.
It also changes
the ingredients in the pie.
As time passes, people spend
their income in different ways,
changing how they spread it
across existing goods,
and developing tastes
for entirely new goods, too.
New industries are created,
new tasks have to be done
and that means often
new roles have to be filled.
So again, the British pie:
300 years ago,
most people worked on farms,
150 years ago, in factories,
and today, most people work in offices.
And once again, people displaced
from tasks in the old bit of pie
could tumble into tasks
in the new bit of pie instead.
Economists call these effects
complementarities,
but really that's just a fancy word
to capture the different way
that technological progress
helps human beings.
Resolving this Terminator myth
shows us that there are
two forces at play:
one, machine substitution
that harms workers,
but also these complementarities
that do the opposite.
Now the second myth,
what I call the intelligence myth.
What do the tasks of driving a car,
making a medical diagnosis
and identifying a bird
at a fleeting glimpse have in common?
Well, these are all tasks
that until very recently,
leading economists thought
couldn't readily be automated.
And yet today, all of these tasks
can be automated.
You know, all major car manufacturers
have driverless car programs.
There's countless systems out there
that can diagnose medical problems.
And there's even an app
that can identify a bird
at a fleeting glimpse.
Now, this wasn't simply a case of bad luck
on the part of economists.
They were wrong,
and the reason why
they were wrong is very important.
They've fallen for the intelligence myth,
the belief that machines
have to copy the way
that human beings think and reason
in order to outperform them.
When these economists
were trying to figure out
what tasks machines could not do,
they imagined the only way
to automate a task
was to sit down with a human being,
get them to explain to you
how it was they performed a task,
and then try and capture that explanation
in a set of instructions
for a machine to follow.
This view was popular in artificial
intelligence at one point, too.
I know this because Richard Susskind,
who is my dad and my coauthor,
wrote his doctorate in the 1980s
on artificial intelligence and the law
at Oxford University,
and he was part of the vanguard.
And with a professor called Phillip Capper
and a legal publisher called Butterworths,
they produced the world's first
commercially available
artificial intelligence system in the law.
This was the home screen design.
He assures me this was
a cool screen design at the time.
(Laughter)
I've never been entirely convinced.
He published it
in the form of two floppy disks,
at a time where floppy disks
genuinely were floppy,
and his approach was the same
as the economists':
sit down with a lawyer,
get her to explain to you
how it was she solved a legal problem,
and then try and capture that explanation
in a set of rules for a machine to follow.
In economics, if human beings
could explain themselves in this way,
the tasks are called routine,
and they could be automated.
But if human beings
can't explain themselves,
the tasks are called non-routine,
and they're thought to be out reach.
Today, that routine-nonroutine
distinction is widespread.
Think how often you hear people say to you
machines can only perform tasks
that are predictable or repetitive,
rules-based or well-defined.
Those are all just
different words for routine.
And go back to those three cases
that I mentioned at the start.
Those are all classic cases
of nonroutine tasks.
Ask a doctor, for instance,
how she makes a medical diagnosis,
and she might be able
to give you a few rules of thumb,
but ultimately she'd struggle.
She'd say it requires things like
creativity and judgment and intuition.
And these things are
very difficult to articulate,
and so it was thought these tasks
would be very hard to automate.
If a human being can't explain themselves,
where on earth do we begin
in writing a set of instructions
for a machine to follow?
Thirty years ago, this view was right,
but today it's looking shaky,
and in the future
it's simply going to be wrong.
Advances in processing power,
in data storage capability
and in algorithm design
mean that this
routine-nonroutine distinction
is diminishingly useful.
To see this, go back to the case
of making a medical diagnosis.
Earlier in the year,
a team of researchers at Stanford
announced they'd developed a system
which can tell you
whether or not a freckle is cancerous
as accurately as leading dermatologists.
How does it work?
It's not trying to copy the judgment
or the intuition of a doctor.
It knows or understands
nothing about medicine at all.
Instead, it's running
a pattern recognition algorithm
through 129,450 past cases,
hunting for similarities
between those cases
and the particular lesion in question.
It's performing these tasks
in an unhuman way,
based on the analysis
of more possible cases
than any doctor could hope
to review in their lifetime.
It didn't matter that that human being,
that doctor, couldn't explain
how she'd performed the task.
Now, there are those
who dwell upon that the fact
that these machines
aren't built in our image.
As an example, take IBM's Watson,
the supercomputer that went
on the US quiz show "Jeopardy!" in 2011,
and it beat the two
human champions at "Jeopardy!"
The day after it won,
The Wall Street Journal ran a piece
by the philosopher John Searle
with the title "Watson
Doesn't Know It Won on 'Jeopardy!'"
Right, and it's brilliant, and it's true.
You know, Watson didn't
let out a cry of excitement.
It didn't call up its parents
to say what a good job it had done.
It didn't go down to the pub for a drink.
This system wasn't trying to copy the way
that those human contestants played,
but it didn't matter.
It still outperformed them.
Resolving the intelligence myth
shows us that our limited understanding
about human intelligence,
about how we think and reason,
is far less of a constraint
on automation than it was in the past.
What's more, as we've seen,
when these machines
perform tasks differently to human beings,
there's no reason to think
that what human beings
are currently capable of doing
represents any sort of summit
in what these machines
might be capable of doing in the future.
Now the third myth,
what I call the superiority myth.
It's often said that those who forget
about the helpful side
of technological progress,
those complementarities from before,
are committing something
known as the lump of labor fallacy.
Now, the problem is
the lump of labor fallacy
is itself a fallacy,
and I call this the lump
of labor fallacy fallacy,
or LOLFF, for short.
Let me explain.
The lump of labor fallacy
is a very old idea.
It was a British economist, David Schloss,
who gave it this name in 1892.
He was puzzled
to come across a dock worker
who had begun to use
a machine to make washers,
the small metal discs
that fasten on the end of screws.
And this dock worker
felt guilty for being more productive.
Now, most of the time,
we expect the opposite,
that people feel guilty
for being unproductive,
you know, a little too much time
on Facebook or Twitter at work.
But this worker felt guilty
for being more productive,
and asked why, he said,
"I know I'm doing wrong.
I'm taking away the work of another man."
In his mind, there was
some fixed lump of work
to be divided up between him and his pals,
so that if he used
this machine to do more,
there'd be less left for his pals to do.
Schloss saw the mistake.
The lump of work wasn't fixed.
As this worker used the machine
and became more productive,
the price of washers would fall,
demand for washers would rise,
more washers would have to be made,
and there'd be more work
for his pals to do.
The lump of work would get bigger.
Schloss called this
"the lump of labor fallacy."
And today you hear people talk
about the lump of labor fallacy
to think about the future
of all types of work.
There's no fixed lump of work
out there to be divided up
between people and machines.
Yes, machines substitute for human beings,
making the original lump of work smaller,
but they also complement human beings,
and the lump of work
gets bigger and changes.
But LOLFF.
Here's the mistake:
it's right to think
that technological progress
makes the lump of work to be done bigger.
Some tasks become more valuable.
New tasks have to be done.
But it's wrong to think that necessarily,
human beings will be best placed
to perform those tasks.
And this is the superiority myth.
Yes, the lump of work
might get bigger and change,
but as machines become more capable,
it's likely that they'll take on
the extra lump of work themselves.
Technological progress,
rather than complement human beings,
complements machines instead.
To see this, go back
to the task of driving a car.
Today, satnav systems
directly complement human beings.
They make some
human beings better drivers.
But in the future,
software is going to displace
human beings from the driving seat,
and these satnav systems,
rather than complement human beings,
will simply make these
driverless cars more efficient,
helping the machines instead.
Or go to those indirect complementarities
that I mentioned as well.
The economic pie may get larger,
but as machines become more capable,
it's possible that any new demand
will fall on goods that machines,
rather than human beings,
are best placed to produce.
The economic pie may change,
but as machines become more capable,
it's possible that they'll be best placed
to do the new tasks that have to be done.
In short, demand for tasks
isn't demand for human labor.
Human beings only stand to benefit
if they retain the upper hand
in all these complemented tasks,
but as machines become more capable,
that becomes less likely.
So what do these three myths tell us then?
Well, resolving the Terminator myth
shows us that the future of work depends
upon this balance between two forces:
one, machine substitution
that harms workers
but also those complementarities
that do the opposite.
And until now, this balance
has fallen in favor of human beings.
But resolving the intelligence myth
shows us that that first force,
machine substitution,
is gathering strength.
Machines, of course, can't do everything,
but they can do far more,
encroaching ever deeper into the realm
of tasks performed by human beings.
What's more, there's no reason to think
that what human beings
are currently capable of
represents any sort of finishing line,
that machines are going
to draw to a polite stop
once they're as capable as us.
Now, none of this matters
so long as those helpful
winds of complementarity
blow firmly enough,
but resolving the superiority myth
shows us that that process
of task encroachment
not only strengthens
the force of machine substitution,
but it wears down
those helpful complementarities too.
Bring these three myths together
and I think we can capture a glimpse
of that troubling future.
Machines continue to become more capable,
encroaching ever deeper
on tasks performed by human beings,
strengthening the force
of machine substitution,
weakening the force
of machine complementarity.
And at some point, that balance
falls in favor of machines
rather than human beings.
This is the path we're currently on.
I say "path" deliberately,
because I don't think we're there yet,
but it is hard to avoid the conclusion
that this is our direction of travel.
That's the troubling part.
Let me say now why I think actually
this is a good problem to have.
For most of human history,
one economic problem has dominated:
how to make the economic pie
large enough for everyone to live on.
Go back to the turn
of the first century AD,
and if you took the global economic pie
and divided it up into equal slices
for everyone in the world,
everyone would get a few hundred dollars.
Almost everyone lived
on or around the poverty line.
And if you roll forward a thousand years,
roughly the same is true.
But in the last few hundred years,
economic growth has taken off.
Those economic pies have exploded in size.
Global GDP per head,
the value of those individual
slices of the pie today,
they're about 10,150 dollars.
If economic growth continues
at two percent,
our children will be twice as rich as us.
If it continues
at a more measly one percent,
our grandchildren
will be twice as rich as us.
By and large, we've solved
that traditional economic problem.
Now, technological unemployment,
if it does happen,
in a strange way will be
a symptom of that success,
will have solved one problem --
how to make the pie bigger --
but replaced it with another --
how to make sure
that everyone gets a slice.
As other economists have noted,
solving this problem won't be easy.
Today, for most people,
their job is their seat
at the economic dinner table,
and in a world with less work
or even without work,
it won't be clear
how they get their slice.
There's a great deal
of discussion, for instance,
about various forms
of universal basic income
as one possible approach,
and there's trials underway
in the United States
and in Finland and in Kenya.
And this is the collective challenge
that's right in front of us,
to figure out how this material prosperity
generated by our economic system
can be enjoyed by everyone
in a world in which
our traditional mechanism
for slicing up the pie,
the work that people do,
withers away and perhaps disappears.
Solving this problem is going to require
us to think in very different ways.
There's going to be a lot of disagreement
about what ought to be done,
but it's important to remember
that this is a far better problem to have
than the one that haunted
our ancestors for centuries:
how to make that pie
big enough in the first place.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
As a software developer and technologist,
I've worked on a number
of civic technology projects
over the years.
Civic tech is sometimes
referred to as tech for good,
using technology to solve
humanitarian problems.
This is in 2010 in Uganda,
working on a solution
that allowed local populations
to avoid government surveillance
on their mobile phones
for expressing dissent.
That same technology was deployed
later in North Africa
for similar purposes
to help activists stay connected
when governments were
deliberately shutting off connectivity
as a means of population control.
But over the years, as I have thought
about these technologies
and the things that I work on,
a question kind of nags
in the back of my mind, which is,
what if we're wrong about
the virtues of technology,
and if it sometimes actively hurts
the communities
that we're intending to help?
The tech industry around the world
tends to operate under similar assumptions
that if we build great things,
it will positively affect everyone.
Eventually, these innovations
will get out and find everyone.
But that's not always the case.
I like to call this blind championing
of technology "trickle-down techonomics,"
to borrow a phrase. (Laughter)
We tend to think that if
we design things for the select few,
eventually those technologies
will reach everyone,
and that's not always the case.
Technology and innovation
behaves a lot like wealth and capital.
They tend to consolidate
in the hands of the few,
and sometimes they find their way out
into the hands of the many.
And so most of you aren't tackling
oppressive regimes on the weekends,
so I wanted to think of a few examples
that might be a little bit more relatable.
In the world of wearables
and smartphones and apps,
there's a big movement
to track people's personal health
with applications that track
the number of calories that you burn
or whether you're sitting too much
or walking enough.
These technologies make patient intake
in medical facilities much more efficient,
and in turn, these medical facilities
are starting to expect
these types of efficiencies.
As these digital tools
find their way into medical rooms,
and they become digitally ready,
what happens to the digitally invisible?
What does the medical experience look like
for someone who doesn't have
the $400 phone or watch
tracking their every movement?
Do they now become a burden
on the medical system?
Is their experience changed?
In the world of finance,
Bitcoin and crypto-currencies
are revolutionizing the way
we move money around the world,
but the challenge with these technologies
is the barrier to entry
is incredibly high, right?
You need access to the same
phones, devices, connectivity,
and even where you don't,
where you can find a proxy agent,
usually they require a certain amount
of capital to participate.
And so the question that I ask myself
is, what happens to the last community
using paper notes when the rest
of the world moves to digital currency?
Another example from my hometown
in Philadelphia:
I recently went
to the public library there,
and they are facing an existential crisis.
Public funding is dwindling,
they have to reduce their footprint
to stay open and stay relevant,
and so one of the ways
they're going about this
is digitizing a number of the books
and moving them to the cloud.
This is great for most kids. Right?
You can check out books from home,
you can research on the way
to school or from school,
but these are really two big assumptions,
that one, you have access at home,
and two, that you have access
to a mobile phone,
and in Philadelphia, many kids do not.
So what does their
education experience look like
in the wake of a completely
cloud-based library,
what used to be considered
such a basic part of education?
How do they stay competitive?
A final example from
across the world in East Africa:
there's been a huge movement
to digitize land ownership rights,
for a number of reasons.
Migrant communities,
older generations dying off,
and ultimately poor record-keeping
have led to conflicts over who owns what.
And so there was a big movement
to put all this information online,
to track all the ownership
of these plots of land,
put them in the cloud,
and give them to the communities.
But actually, the unintended
consequence of this
has been that venture capitalists,
investors, real estate developers,
have swooped in and they've begun
buying up these plots of land
right out from under these communities,
because they have access
to the technologies
and the connectivity
that makes that possible.
So that's the common thread
that connects these examples,
the unintended consequences of the tools
and the technologies that we make.
As engineers, as technologists,
we sometimes prefer
efficiency over efficacy.
We think more about doing things
than the outcomes of what we are doing.
This needs to change.
We have a responsibility to think about
the outcomes of the technologies we build,
especially as they increasingly
control the world in which we live.
In the late '90s,
there was a big push for ethics
in the world of investment and banking.
I think in 2014, we're long overdue
for a similar movement
in the area of tech and technology.
So, I just encourage you, as you are all
thinking about the next big thing,
as entrepreneurs, as CEOs,
as engineers, as makers,
that you think about
the unintended consequences
of the things that you're building,
because the real innovation
is in finding ways to include everyone.
Thank you.
(Applause)
I was here four years ago,
and I remember, at the time,
that the talks weren't put online.
I think they were given
to TEDsters in a box,
a box set of DVDs,
which they put on their shelves,
where they are now.
(Laughter)
And actually, Chris called me
a week after I'd given my talk, and said,
"We're going to start putting them online.
Can we put yours online?"
And I said, "Sure."
And four years later,
it's been downloaded four million times.
So I suppose you could multiply that
by 20 or something
to get the number
of people who've seen it.
And, as Chris says, there is
a hunger for videos of me.
(Laughter)
(Applause)
Don't you feel?
(Laughter)
So, this whole event
has been an elaborate build-up
to me doing another one
for you, so here it is.
(Laughter)
Al Gore spoke at the TED conference
I spoke at four years ago
and talked about the climate crisis.
And I referenced that
at the end of my last talk.
So I want to pick up from there
because I only had 18 minutes, frankly.
(Laughter)
So, as I was saying --
(Laughter)
You see, he's right.
I mean, there is a major
climate crisis, obviously,
and I think if people don't believe it,
they should get out more.
(Laughter)
But I believe there is
a second climate crisis,
which is as severe,
which has the same origins,
and that we have to deal with
with the same urgency.
And you may say, by the way,
"Look, I'm good.
I have one climate crisis,
I don't really need the second one."
(Laughter)
But this is a crisis of,
not natural resources --
though I believe that's true --
but a crisis of human resources.
I believe fundamentally,
as many speakers have said
during the past few days,
that we make very poor use of our talents.
Very many people go
through their whole lives
having no real sense
of what their talents may be,
or if they have any to speak of.
I meet all kinds of people
who don't think
they're really good at anything.
Actually, I kind of divide the world
into two groups now.
Jeremy Bentham, the great
utilitarian philosopher,
once spiked this argument.
He said, "There are two types
of people in this world:
those who divide the world into two types
and those who do not."
(Laughter)
Well, I do.
(Laughter)
I meet all kinds of people
who don't enjoy what they do.
They simply go through their lives
getting on with it.
They get no great pleasure
from what they do.
They endure it rather than enjoy it,
and wait for the weekend.
But I also meet people
who love what they do
and couldn't imagine doing anything else.
If you said, "Don't do this anymore,"
they'd wonder what you're talking about.
It isn't what they do, it's who they are.
They say, "But this is me, you know.
It would be foolish to abandon this,
because it speaks
to my most authentic self."
And it's not true of enough people.
In fact, on the contrary, I think
it's still true of a minority of people.
And I think there are many
possible explanations for it.
And high among them is education,
because education, in a way,
dislocates very many people
from their natural talents.
And human resources
are like natural resources;
they're often buried deep.
You have to go looking for them,
they're not just lying around
on the surface.
You have to create the circumstances
where they show themselves.
And you might imagine
education would be the way that happens,
but too often, it's not.
Every education system in the world
is being reformed at the moment
and it's not enough.
Reform is no use anymore,
because that's simply improving
a broken model.
What we need --
and the word's been used
many times in the past few days --
is not evolution,
but a revolution in education.
This has to be transformed
into something else.
(Applause)
One of the real challenges
is to innovate fundamentally in education.
Innovation is hard,
because it means doing something
that people don't find very easy,
for the most part.
It means challenging
what we take for granted,
things that we think are obvious.
The great problem for reform
or transformation
is the tyranny of common sense.
Things that people think,
"It can't be done differently,
that's how it's done."
I came across a great quote recently
from Abraham Lincoln,
who I thought you'd be pleased
to have quoted at this point.
(Laughter)
He said this in December 1862
to the second annual meeting of Congress.
I ought to explain that I have no idea
what was happening at the time.
We don't teach
American history in Britain.
(Laughter)
We suppress it.
You know, this is our policy.
(Laughter)
No doubt, something fascinating
was happening then,
which the Americans among us
will be aware of.
But he said this:
"The dogmas of the quiet past
are inadequate to the stormy present.
The occasion
is piled high with difficulty,
and we must rise with the occasion."
I love that.
Not rise to it, rise with it.
"As our case is new,
so we must think anew and act anew.
We must disenthrall ourselves,
and then we shall save our country."
I love that word, "disenthrall."
You know what it means?
That there are ideas
that all of us are enthralled to,
which we simply take for granted
as the natural order of things,
the way things are.
And many of our ideas have been formed,
not to meet the circumstances
of this century,
but to cope with the circumstances
of previous centuries.
But our minds
are still hypnotized by them,
and we have to disenthrall ourselves
of some of them.
Now, doing this is easier said than done.
It's very hard to know, by the way,
what it is you take for granted.
And the reason
is that you take it for granted.
(Laughter)
Let me ask you something
you may take for granted.
How many of you here
are over the age of 25?
That's not what you take for granted,
I'm sure you're familiar with that.
Are there any people here
under the age of 25?
Great. Now, those over 25,
could you put your hands up
if you're wearing your wristwatch?
Now that's a great deal of us, isn't it?
Ask a room full of teenagers
the same thing.
Teenagers do not wear wristwatches.
I don't mean they can't,
they just often choose not to.
And the reason is we were brought up
in a pre-digital culture,
those of us over 25.
And so for us,
if you want to know the time,
you have to wear something to tell it.
Kids now live in a world
which is digitized,
and the time, for them, is everywhere.
They see no reason to do this.
And by the way, you don't need either;
it's just that you've always done it
and you carry on doing it.
My daughter never wears a watch,
my daughter Kate, who's 20.
She doesn't see the point.
As she says,
"It's a single-function device."
(Laughter)
"Like, how lame is that?"
And I say, "No, no,
it tells the date as well."
(Laughter)
"It has multiple functions."
(Laughter)
But, you see, there are things
we're enthralled to in education.
A couple of examples.
One of them is the idea of linearity:
that it starts here
and you go through a track
and if you do everything right,
you will end up set
for the rest of your life.
Everybody who's spoken at TED
has told us implicitly,
or sometimes explicitly,
a different story:
that life is not linear; it's organic.
We create our lives symbiotically
as we explore our talents
in relation to the circumstances
they help to create for us.
But, you know, we have become obsessed
with this linear narrative.
And probably the pinnacle for education
is getting you to college.
I think we are obsessed
with getting people to college.
Certain sorts of college.
I don't mean you shouldn't go,
but not everybody needs to go,
or go now.
Maybe they go later, not right away.
And I was up in San Francisco
a while ago doing a book signing.
There was this guy buying a book,
he was in his 30s.
I said, "What do you do?"
And he said, "I'm a fireman."
I asked, "How long
have you been a fireman?"
"Always. I've always been a fireman."
"Well, when did you decide?"
He said, "As a kid.
Actually, it was
a problem for me at school,
because at school,
everybody wanted to be a fireman."
(Laughter)
He said, "But I wanted to be a fireman."
And he said, "When I got
to the senior year of school,
my teachers didn't take it seriously.
This one teacher didn't take it seriously.
He said I was throwing my life away
if that's all I chose to do with it;
that I should go to college, I should
become a professional person,
that I had great potential
and I was wasting my talent to do that."
He said, "It was humiliating.
It was in front of the whole class
and I felt dreadful.
But it's what I wanted,
and as soon as I left school,
I applied to the fire service
and I was accepted.
You know, I was thinking
about that guy recently,
just a few minutes ago when you
were speaking, about this teacher,
because six months ago, I saved his life."
(Laughter)
He said, "He was in a car wreck,
and I pulled him out, gave him CPR,
and I saved his wife's life as well."
He said, "I think he thinks
better of me now."
(Laughter)
(Applause)
You know, to me,
human communities depend
upon a diversity of talent,
not a singular conception of ability.
And at the heart of our challenges --
(Applause)
At the heart of the challenge
is to reconstitute our sense of ability
and of intelligence.
This linearity thing is a problem.
When I arrived in L.A.
about nine years ago,
I came across a policy statement --
very well-intentioned --
which said, "College
begins in kindergarten."
No, it doesn't.
(Laughter)
It doesn't.
If we had time,
I could go into this, but we don't.
(Laughter)
Kindergarten begins in kindergarten.
(Laughter)
A friend of mine once said,
"A three year-old
is not half a six year-old."
(Laughter)
(Applause)
They're three.
But as we just heard in this last session,
there's such competition now
to get into kindergarten --
to get to the right kindergarten --
that people are being interviewed
for it at three.
Kids sitting in front
of unimpressed panels,
you know, with their resumes --
(Laughter)
Flicking through and saying,
"What, this is it?"
(Laughter)
(Applause)
"You've been around
for 36 months, and this is it?"
(Laughter)
"You've achieved nothing -- commit.
(Laughter)
Spent the first six months
breastfeeding, I can see."
(Laughter)
See, it's outrageous as a conception.
The other big issue is conformity.
We have built our education systems
on the model of fast food.
This is something Jamie Oliver
talked about the other day.
There are two models
of quality assurance in catering.
One is fast food,
where everything is standardized.
The other is like Zagat
and Michelin restaurants,
where everything is not standardized,
they're customized to local circumstances.
And we have sold ourselves
into a fast-food model of education,
and it's impoverishing
our spirit and our energies
as much as fast food is depleting
our physical bodies.
(Applause)
We have to recognize
a couple of things here.
One is that human talent
is tremendously diverse.
People have very different aptitudes.
I worked out recently
that I was given a guitar as a kid
at about the same time
that Eric Clapton got his first guitar.
(Laughter)
It worked out for Eric,
that's all I'm saying.
(Laughter)
In a way --
it did not for me.
I could not get this thing to work
no matter how often
or how hard I blew into it.
It just wouldn't work.
(Laughter)
But it's not only about that.
It's about passion.
Often, people are good at things
they don't really care for.
It's about passion,
and what excites
our spirit and our energy.
And if you're doing the thing
that you love to do, that you're good at,
time takes a different course entirely.
My wife's just finished writing a novel,
and I think it's a great book,
but she disappears for hours on end.
You know this, if you're doing
something you love,
an hour feels like five minutes.
If you're doing something
that doesn't resonate with your spirit,
five minutes feels like an hour.
And the reason so many people
are opting out of education
is because it doesn't feed their spirit,
it doesn't feed their energy
or their passion.
So I think we have to change metaphors.
We have to go from what is essentially
an industrial model of education,
a manufacturing model,
which is based on linearity
and conformity and batching people.
We have to move to a model
that is based more
on principles of agriculture.
We have to recognize
that human flourishing
is not a mechanical process;
it's an organic process.
And you cannot predict
the outcome of human development.
All you can do, like a farmer,
is create the conditions
under which they will begin to flourish.
So when we look at reforming
education and transforming it,
it isn't like cloning a system.
There are great ones,
like KIPP's; it's a great system.
There are many great models.
It's about customizing
to your circumstances
and personalizing education
to the people you're actually teaching.
And doing that, I think,
is the answer to the future
because it's not
about scaling a new solution;
it's about creating
a movement in education
in which people develop
their own solutions,
but with external support
based on a personalized curriculum.
Now in this room,
there are people who represent
extraordinary resources in business,
in multimedia, in the Internet.
These technologies,
combined with the extraordinary
talents of teachers,
provide an opportunity
to revolutionize education.
And I urge you to get involved in it
because it's vital, not just to ourselves,
but to the future of our children.
But we have to change
from the industrial model
to an agricultural model,
where each school can be
flourishing tomorrow.
That's where children experience life.
Or at home, if that's what they choose,
to be educated
with their families or friends.
There's been a lot of talk about dreams
over the course of these few days.
And I wanted to just very quickly --
I was very struck
by Natalie Merchant's songs last night,
recovering old poems.
I wanted to read you
a quick, very short poem
from W. B. Yeats,
who some of you may know.
He wrote this to his love, Maud Gonne,
and he was bewailing the fact
that he couldn't really give her
what he thought she wanted from him.
And he says, "I've got something else,
but it may not be for you."
He says this:
"Had I the heavens' embroidered cloths,
Enwrought with gold and silver light,
The blue and the dim and the dark cloths
Of night and light and the half-light,
I would spread the cloths under your feet:
But I, being poor, have only my dreams;
I have spread my dreams under your feet;
Tread softly
because you tread on my dreams."
And every day, everywhere,
our children spread
their dreams beneath our feet.
And we should tread softly.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
Thank you.
(Applause)
Well, the subject of difficult negotiation
reminds me of one of my favorite stories
from the Middle East,
of a man who left
to his three sons, 17 camels.
To the first son, he left half the camels;
to the second son,
he left a third of the camels;
and to the youngest son,
he left a ninth of the camels.
The three sons got into a negotiation --
17 doesn't divide by two.
It doesn't divide by three.
It doesn't divide by nine.
Brotherly tempers started to get strained.
Finally, in desperation,
they went and they consulted
a wise old woman.
The wise old woman thought
about their problem for a long time,
and finally she came back and said,
"Well, I don't know if I can help you,
but at least, if you want,
you can have my camel."
So then, they had 18 camels.
The first son took his half --
half of 18 is nine.
The second son took his third --
a third of 18 is six.
The youngest son took his ninth --
a ninth of 18 is two.
You get 17.
They had one camel left over.
They gave it back to the wise old woman.
(Laughter)
Now, if you think
about that story for a moment,
I think it resembles a lot
of the difficult negotiations
we get involved in.
They start off like 17 camels,
no way to resolve it.
Somehow, what we need to do
is step back from those situations,
like that wise old woman,
look at the situation through fresh eyes
and come up with an 18th camel.
Finding that 18th camel
in the world's conflicts
has been my life passion.
I basically see humanity
a bit like those three brothers.
We're all one family.
We know that scientifically,
thanks to the communications revolution,
all the tribes on the planet --
all 15,000 tribes --
are in touch with each other.
And it's a big family reunion.
And yet, like many family reunions,
it's not all peace and light.
There's a lot of conflict,
and the question is:
How do we deal with our differences?
How do we deal with
our deepest differences,
given the human propensity for conflict
and the human genius at devising
weapons of enormous destruction?
That's the question.
As I've spent the last better part
of three decades, almost four,
traveling the world,
trying to work, getting
involved in conflicts
ranging from Yugoslavia to the Middle East
to Chechnya to Venezuela --
some of the most difficult conflicts
on the face of the planet --
I've been asking myself that question.
And I think I've found, in some ways,
what is the secret to peace.
It's actually surprisingly simple.
It's not easy, but it's simple.
It's not even new.
It may be one of our most
ancient human heritages.
The secret to peace is us.
It's us who act as a surrounding
community around any conflict,
who can play a constructive role.
Let me give you just a story, an example.
About 20 years ago,
I was in South Africa,
working with the parties in that conflict,
and I had an extra month,
so I spent some time living
with several groups of San Bushmen.
I was curious about them, about the way
in which they resolve conflict.
Because, after all, within living memory,
they were hunters and gatherers,
living pretty much
like our ancestors lived
for maybe 99 percent of the human story.
And all the men have these poison arrows
that they use for hunting --
absolutely fatal.
So how do they deal
with their differences?
Well, what I learned is, whenever
tempers rise in those communities,
someone goes and hides
the poison arrows out in the bush,
and then everyone sits around
in a circle like this,
and they sit and they talk and they talk.
It may take two days,
three days, four days,
but they don't rest
until they find a resolution
or better yet -- a reconciliation.
And if tempers are still too high,
then they send someone
off to visit some relatives,
as a cooling-off period.
Well, that system is, I think,
probably the system
that kept us alive to this point,
given our human tendencies.
That system, I call "the third side."
Because if you think about it,
normally when we think of conflict,
when we describe it,
there's always two sides --
it's Arabs versus Israelis,
labor versus management,
husband versus wife,
Republicans versus Democrats.
But what we don't often see
is that there's always a third side,
and the third side of the conflict is us,
it's the surrounding community,
it's the friends, the allies,
the family members, the neighbors.
And we can play
an incredibly constructive role.
Perhaps the most fundamental way
in which the third side can help
is to remind the parties
of what's really at stake.
For the sake of the kids,
for the sake of the family,
for the sake of the community,
for the sake of the future,
let's stop fighting for a moment
and start talking.
Because, the thing is,
when we're involved in conflict,
it's very easy to lose perspective.
It's very easy to react.
Human beings -- we're reaction machines.
And as the saying goes,
when angry, you will make the best speech
you will ever regret.
(Laughter)
And so the third side reminds us of that.
The third side helps us go to the balcony,
which is a metaphor
for a place of perspective,
where we can keep our eyes on the prize.
Let me tell you a little story
from my own negotiating experience.
Some years ago, I was involved
as a facilitator in some very tough talks
between the leaders of Russia
and the leaders of Chechnya.
There was a war going on, as you know.
And we met in the Hague,
in the Peace Palace,
in the same room where the Yugoslav
war-crimes tribunal was taking place.
And the talks got off
to a rather rocky start
when the vice president of Chechnya
began by pointing at the Russians
and said, "You should stay
right here in your seats,
because you're going
to be on trial for war crimes."
And then he turned to me and said,
"You're an American.
Look at what you Americans
are doing in Puerto Rico."
And my mind started racing, "Puerto Rico?
What do I know about Puerto Rico?"
I started reacting.
(Laughter)
But then, I tried to remember
to go to the balcony.
And then when he paused
and everyone looked at me for a response,
from a balcony perspective,
I was able to thank him for his remarks
and say, "I appreciate
your criticism of my country
and I take it as a sign
that we're among friends
and can speak candidly to one another."
(Laughter)
"And what we're here to do is not
to talk about Puerto Rico or the past.
We're here to see
if we can figure out a way
to stop the suffering
and the bloodshed in Chechnya."
The conversation got back on track.
That's the role of the third side,
to help the parties go to the balcony.
Now let me take you, for a moment,
to what's widely regarded as the world's
most difficult conflict,
or the most impossible conflict,
the Middle East.
Question is: where's the third side there?
How could we possibly go to the balcony?
Now, I don't pretend to have an answer
to the Middle East conflict,
but I think I've got a first step --
literally, a first step --
something that any one of us
could do as third-siders.
Let me just ask you one question first.
How many of you in the last years
have ever found yourself
worrying about the Middle East
and wondering what anyone could do?
Just out of curiosity, how many of you?
OK, so the great majority of us.
And here, it's so far away.
Why do we pay so much attention
to this conflict?
Is it the number of deaths?
There are a hundred times more people
who die in a conflict in Africa
than in the Middle East.
No, it's because of the story,
because we feel personally
involved in that story.
Whether we're Christians, Muslims or Jews,
religious or non-religious,
we feel we have a personal stake in it.
Stories matter;
as an anthropologist, I know that.
Stories are what we use
to transmit knowledge.
They give meaning to our lives.
That's what we tell here
at TED, we tell stories.
Stories are the key.
And so my question is --
yes, let's try and resolve the politics
there in the Middle East,
but let's also take a look at the story.
Let's try to get at the root
of what it's all about.
Let's see if we can apply
the third side to it.
What would that mean?
What is the story there?
Now, as anthropologists, we know
that every culture has an origin story.
What's the origin story
of the Middle East?
In a phrase, it's:
Four thousand years ago,
a man and his family walked
across the Middle East,
and the world has never
been the same since.
That man, of course, was Abraham.
And what he stood for was unity,
the unity of the family;
he's the father of us all.
But it's not just what he stood for,
it's what his message was.
His basic message was unity too,
the interconnectedness of it all,
the unity of it all.
And his basic value was respect,
was kindness toward strangers.
That's what he's known for,
his hospitality.
So in that sense,
he's the symbolic third side
of the Middle East.
He's the one who reminds us
that we're all part of a greater whole.
Now, think about that for a moment.
Today, we face the scourge of terrorism.
What is terrorism?
Terrorism is basically
taking an innocent stranger
and treating them as an enemy
whom you kill in order to create fear.
What's the opposite of terrorism?
It's taking an innocent stranger
and treating them as a friend
whom you welcome into your home,
in order to sow and create understanding
or respect, or love.
So what if, then, you took
the story of Abraham,
which is a third-side story,
what if that could be --
because Abraham stands for hospitality --
what if that could be
an antidote to terrorism?
What if that could be a vaccine
against religious intolerance?
How would you bring that story to life?
Now, it's not enough just to tell a story.
That's powerful, but people need
to experience the story.
They need to be able to live the story.
How would you do that?
And that was my thinking
of how would you do that.
And that's what comes
to the first step here.
Because the simple way to do that is:
you go for a walk.
You go for a walk
in the footsteps of Abraham.
You retrace the footsteps of Abraham.
Because walking has a real power.
You know, as an anthropologist,
walking is what made us human.
It's funny -- when you walk,
you walk side-by-side,
in the same common direction.
Now if I were to come to you face-to-face
and come this close to you,
you would feel threatened.
But if I walk shoulder-to-shoulder,
even touching shoulders,
it's no problem.
Who fights while they walk?
That's why in negotiations,
often, when things get tough,
people go for walks in the woods.
So the idea came to me
of, what about inspiring a path,
a route -- think the Silk Route,
think the Appalachian Trail --
that followed in the footsteps of Abraham?
People said, "That's crazy. You can't.
You can't retrace the footsteps
of Abraham -- it's too insecure,
you've got to cross all these borders,
it goes across 10 different countries
in the Middle East,
because it unites them all."
And so we studied the idea at Harvard.
We did our due diligence.
And then a few years ago,
a group of us, about 25 of us
from 10 different countries,
decided to see if we could retrace
the footsteps of Abraham,
going from his initial birthplace
in the city of Urfa
in Southern Turkey, Northern Mesopotamia.
And we then took a bus and took some walks
and went to Harran, where, in the Bible,
he sets off on his journey.
Then we crossed the border
into Syria, went to Aleppo,
which, turns out, is named after Abraham.
We went to Damascus,
which has a long history
associated with Abraham.
We then came to Northern Jordan,
to Jerusalem -- which is all
about Abraham -- to Bethlehem,
and finally, to the place
where he's buried, in Hebron.
So effectively, we went from womb to tomb.
We showed it could be done.
It was an amazing journey.
Let me ask you a question.
How many of you have had the experience
of being in a strange neighborhood
or strange land,
and a total stranger, perfect stranger,
comes up to you
and shows you some kindness --
maybe invites you into their home,
gives you a drink,
gives you a coffee, gives you a meal?
How many of you have ever
had that experience?
That's the essence of the Abraham Path.
That's what you discover as you go
into these villages in the Middle East
where you expect hostility,
and you get the most amazing hospitality,
all associated with Abraham:
"In the name of Father Ibrahim,
let me offer you some food."
So what we discovered
is that Abraham is not just a figure
out of a book for those people;
he's alive, he's a living presence.
And to make a long story short,
in the last couple of years now,
thousands of people have begun to walk
parts of the path of Abraham
in the Middle East,
enjoying the hospitality
of the people there.
They've begun to walk
in Israel and Palestine,
in Jordan, in Turkey, in Syria.
It's an amazing experience.
Men, women, young people, old people --
more women than men,
actually, interestingly.
For those who can't walk,
who are unable to get there right now,
people started to organize walks
in cities, in their own communities.
In Cincinnati, for instance,
they organized a walk
from a church to a mosque to a synagogue
and all had an Abrahamic meal together.
It was Abraham Path Day.
In São Paulo, Brazil,
it's become an annual event
for thousands of people to run
in a virtual Abraham Path Run,
uniting the different communities.
The media love it; they really adore it.
They lavish attention on it
because it's visual
and it spreads the idea,
this idea of Abrahamic hospitality,
of kindness towards strangers.
And just a couple weeks ago,
there was an NPR story on it.
Last month,
there was a piece
in the Manchester Guardian about it,
two whole pages.
And they quoted a villager
who said, "This walk connects
us to the world."
He said, "It was like a light
that went on in our lives --
it brought us hope."
And so that's what it's about.
But it's not just about psychology;
it's about economics.
Because as people walk, they spend money.
And this woman right here, Um Ahmad,
is a woman who lives on the path
in Northern Jordan.
She's desperately poor.
She's partially blind,
her husband can't work,
she's got seven kids.
But what she can do is cook.
And so she's begun to cook
for some groups of walkers
who come through the village
and have a meal in her home.
They sit on the floor --
she doesn't even have a tablecloth.
She makes the most delicious food,
that's fresh from the herbs
in the surrounding countryside.
And so more and more walkers have come,
and lately she's begun to earn an income
to support her family.
And so she told our team there, she said,
"You have made me visible
in a village where people
were once ashamed to look at me."
That's the potential of the Abraham Path.
There are literally hundreds
of those kinds of communities
across the Middle East, across the path.
The potential is basically
to change the game.
And to change the game, you have to change
the frame, the way we see things --
to change the frame
from hostility to hospitality,
from terrorism to tourism.
And in that sense, the Abraham Path
is a game-changer.
Let me just show you one thing.
I have a little acorn here
that I picked up while I was walking
on the path earlier this year.
Now, the acorn is associated
with the oak tree, of course --
grows into an oak tree,
which is associated with Abraham.
The path right now is like an acorn;
it's still in its early phase.
What would the oak tree look like?
When I think back to my childhood,
a good part of which I spent,
after being born here in Chicago,
I spent in Europe.
If you had been in the ruins of, say,
London in 1945, or Berlin,
and you had said,
"Sixty years from now,
this is going to be the most peaceful,
prosperous part of the planet,"
people would have thought
you were certifiably insane.
But they did it, thanks
to a common identity, Europe,
and a common economy.
So my question is,
if it can be done in Europe,
why not in the Middle East?
Why not, thanks to a common identity,
which is the story of Abraham,
and thanks to a common economy that
would be based, in good part, on tourism?
So let me conclude, then,
by saying that in the last 35 years,
as I've worked
in some of the most dangerous,
difficult and intractable conflicts
around the planet,
I have yet to see one conflict
that I felt could not be transformed.
It's not easy, of course.
But it's possible.
It was done in South Africa.
It was done in Northern Ireland.
It could be done anywhere.
It simply depends on us.
It depends on us taking the third side.
So let me invite you to consider
taking the third side,
even as a very small step.
We're about to take a break in a moment.
Just go up to someone
who's from a different culture,
a different country,
a different ethnicity --
some difference --
and engage them in a conversation.
Listen to them.
That's a third-side act.
That's walking Abraham's Path.
After a TED Talk,
why not a TED Walk?
(Laughter)
So let me just leave you
with three things.
One is, the secret to peace
is the third side.
The third side is us.
Each of us, with a single step,
can take the world, can bring the world
a step closer to peace.
There's an old African proverb that goes:
"When spiderwebs unite,
they can halt even the lion."
If we're able to unite
our third-side webs of peace,
we can even halt the lion of war.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
These dragons from deep time
are incredible creatures.
They're bizzarre,
they're beautiful,
and there's very little
we know about them.
These thoughts were going
through my head
when I looked at the pages of
my first dinosaur book.
I was about five years old at the time,
and I decided there and then

that I would become a paleontologist.
Paleontology allowed me 
to combine my love for animals
with my desire to travel to 
far-flung corners of the world.
And now, a few years later,
I've led several expeditions
to the ultimate far-flung corner 
on this planet, the Sahara.
I've worked in the Sahara because
I've been on a quest
to uncover new remains of
a bizarre, giant predatory dinosaur
called Spinosaurus.
A few bones of this animal
have been found
in the deserts of Egypt
and were described about 100 years ago
by a German paleontologist.
Unfortunately, all his Spinosaurus bones
were destroyed in World War II.
So all we're left with are just
a few drawings and notes.
From these drawings,
we know that this creature, which lived 
about 100 million years ago,
was very big,
it had tall spines on its back,
forming a magnificent sail,
and it had long, slender jaws, 
a bit like a crocodile,
with conical teeth,
that may have been used 
to catch slippery prey, like fish.
But that was pretty much 
all we knew
about this animal for the next 100 years.
My fieldwork took me to the border region
between Morocco and Algeria,
a place called the Kem Kem.
It's a difficult place to work in.
You have to deal with sandstorms
and snakes and scorpions,
and it's very difficult to find
good fossils there.
But our hard work paid off.
We discovered many incredible specimens.
There's the largest dinosaur bone
that had ever been found
in this part of the Sahara.
We found remains of giant
predatory dinosaurs,
medium-sized predatory dinosaurs,
and seven or eight different kinds
of crocodile-like hunters.
These fossils were deposited
in a river system.
The river system was also home 
to a giant, car-sized coelacanth,
a monster sawfish,
and the skies over the river system
were filled with pterosaurs,
flying reptiles.
It was a pretty dangerous place,
not the kind of place where you'd want
to travel to if you had a time machine.
So we're finding all these 
incredible fossils of animals
that lived alongside Spinosaurus,
but Spinosaurus itself proved
to be very elusive.
We were just finding bits and pieces
and I was hoping that we'd find
a partial skeleton at some point.
Finally, very recently,
we were able to track down a dig site
where a local fossil hunter found
several bones of Spinosaurus.
We returned to the site,
we collected more bones.
And so after 100 years we finally
had another partial skeleton
of this bizarre creature.
And we were able to reconstruct it.
We now know that 
Spinosaurus had a head
a little bit like a crocodile,
very different from other 
predatory dinosaurs,
very different from the T. rex.
But the really interesting information
came from the rest of the skeleton.
We had long spines,
the spines forming the big sail.
We had leg bones, we had skull bones,
we had paddle-shaped feet, wide feet --
again, very unusual, no other
dinosaur has feet like this --
and we think they may have been
used to walk on soft sediment,
or maybe for paddling in the water.
We also looked at the fine
microstructure of the bone,
the inside structure of Spinosaurus bones,
and it turns out that they're
very dense and compact.
Again, this is something we see in animals
that spend a lot of time in the water,
it's useful for buoyancy 
control in the water.
We C.T.-scanned all of our bones
and built a digital Spinosaurus skeleton.
And when we looked 
at the digital skeleton,
we realized that yes, this was
a dinosaur unlike any other.
It's bigger than a T. rex,
and yes, the head has "fish-eating"
written all over it,
but really the entire skeleton has
"water-loving" written all over it --
dense bone, paddle-like feet,
and the hind limbs are reduced in size,
and again, this is something
we see in animals
that spend a substantial amount 
of time in the water.
So, as we fleshed out our Spinosaurus --
I'm looking at muscle attachments
and wrapping our dinosaur in skin --
we realize that we're dealing
with a river monster,
a predatory dinosaur, bigger than T. rex,
the ruler of this ancient river of giants,
feeding on the many aquatic animals
I showed you earlier on.
So that's really what makes this
an incredible discovery.
It's a dinosaur like no other.
And some people told me, "Wow,
this is a once-in-a-lifetime discovery.
There are not many things left
to discover in the world."
Well, I think nothing could be 
further from the truth.
I think the Sahara's 
still full of treasures,
and when people tell me there are
no places left to explore,
I like to quote a famous dinosaur hunter,
Roy Chapman Andrews,
and he said, "Always, there has been
an adventure just around the corner --
and the world is still full of corners."
That was true many decades ago
when Roy Chapman Andrews
wrote these lines.
And it is still true today.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Twelve years ago, I picked up
a camera for the first time
to film the olive harvest
in a Palestinian village in the West Bank.
I thought I was there
to make a single documentary
and would then move on
to some other part of the world.
But something kept bringing me back.
Now, usually, when international audiences
hear about that part of the world,
they often just want
that conflict to go away.
The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is bad,
and we wish it could just disappear.
We feel much the same way
about other conflicts around the world.
But every time we turn
our attention to the news,
it seems like one more country
has gone up in flames.
So I've been wondering
whether we should not start
looking at conflict in a different way --
whether instead of simply
wishing to end conflict,
we focus instead on how to wage conflict.
This has been a big question for me,
one I've pursued together with my team
at the nonprofit Just Vision.
After witnessing several different kinds
of struggles in the Middle East,
I started noticing some patterns
on the more successful ones.
I wondered whether these variables
held across cases, and if they did,
what lessons we could glean
for waging constructive conflict,
in Palestine, Israel and elsewhere.
There is some science about this.
In a study of 323
major political conflicts
from 1900 to 2006,
Maria Stephan and Erica Chenoweth
found that nonviolent campaigns
were almost 100 percent more likely
to lead to success than violent campaigns.
Nonviolent campaigns are also
less likely to cause physical harm
to those waging the campaign,
as well as their opponents.
And, critically, they typically lead
to more peaceful and democratic societies.
In other words, nonviolent resistance
is a more effective and constructive way
of waging conflict.
But if that's such an easy choice,
why don't more groups use it?
Political scientist Victor Asal
and colleagues
have looked at several factors
that shape a political group's
choice of tactics.
And it turns out
that the greatest predictor
of a movement's decision
to adopt nonviolence or violence
is not whether that group
is more left-wing or right-wing,
not whether the group is more or less
influenced by religious beliefs,
not whether it's up against
a democracy or a dictatorship,
and not even the levels of repression
that that group is facing.
The greatest predictor of a movement's
decision to adopt nonviolence
is its ideology regarding
the role of women in public life.
(Applause)
When a movement includes in its discourse
language around gender equality,
it increases dramatically
the chances it will adopt nonviolence,
and thus, the likelihood it will succeed.
The research squared up
with my own documentation
of political organizing
in Israel and Palestine.
I've noticed that movements which
welcome women into leadership positions,
such as the one I documented
in a village called Budrus,
were much more likely
to achieve their goals.
This village was under a real threat
of being wiped off the map
when Israel started building
the separation barrier.
The proposed route would require
the destruction of this community's
olive groves, their cemeteries
and would ultimately
enclose the village from all sides.
Through inspired local leadership,
they launched a nonviolent resistance
campaign to stop that from happening.
The odds were massively
stacked against them.
But they had a secret weapon:
a 15-year-old girl
who courageously jumped
in front of a bulldozer
which was about to uproot
an olive tree, stopping it.
In that moment, the community
of Budrus realized what was possible
if they welcomed and encouraged women
to participate in public life.
And so it was that the women of Budrus
went to the front lines day after day,
using their creativity and acumen
to overcome multiple obstacles they faced
in a 10-month unarmed struggle.
And as you can probably
tell at this point,
they win at the end.
The separation barrier
was changed completely
to the internationally
recognized green line,
and the women of Budrus
came to be known across the West Bank
for their indomitable energy.
(Applause)
Thank you.
I want to pause for a second,
which you helped me do,
because I do want to tackle
two very serious misunderstandings
that could happen at this point.
The first one is that I don't believe
women are inherently or essentially
more peaceful than men.
But I do believe that in today's world,
women experience power differently.
Having had to navigate
being in the less powerful position
in multiple aspects of their lives,
women are often more adept
at how to surreptitiously
pressure for change
against large, powerful actors.
The term "manipulative," often charged
against women in a derogatory way,
reflects a reality in which women
have often had to find ways
other than direct confrontation
to achieve their goals.
And finding alternatives
to direct confrontation
is at the core of nonviolent resistance.
Now to the second
potential misunderstanding.
I've been talking a lot about
my experiences in the Middle East,
and some of you might be thinking now
that the solution then is for us
to educate Muslim and Arab societies
to be more inclusive of their women.
If we were to do that,
they would be more successful.
They do not need this kind of help.
Women have been part
of the most influential movements
coming out of the Middle East,
but they tend to be invisible
to the international community.
Our cameras are largely focused on the men
who often end up involved
in the more confrontational scenes
that we find so irresistible
in our news cycle.
And we end up with a narrative
that not only erases women
from the struggles in the region
but often misrepresents
the struggles themselves.
In the late 1980s,
an uprising started in Gaza,
and quickly spread to the West Bank
and East Jerusalem.
It came to be known as the First Intifada,
and people who have
any visual memory of it
generally conjure up something like this:
Palestinian men
throwing rocks at Israeli tanks.
The news coverage at the time
made it seem like stones,
Molotov cocktails and burning tires
were the only activities
taking place in the Intifada.
This period, though, was also marked
by widespread nonviolent organizing
in the forms of strikes, sit-ins
and the creation of parallel institutions.
During the First Intifada,
whole sectors of the Palestinian
civilian population mobilized,
cutting across generations,
factions and class lines.
They did this through networks
of popular committees,
and their use of direct action
and communal self-help projects
challenged Israel's very ability
to continue ruling the West Bank and Gaza.
According to the Israeli Army itself,
97 percent of activities
during the First Intifada were unarmed.
And here's another thing that is not
part of our narrative about that time.
For 18 months in the Intifada,
women were the ones
calling the shots behind the scenes:
Palestinian women from all walks of life
in charge of mobilizing
hundreds of thousands of people
in a concerted effort to withdraw
consent from the occupation.
Naela Ayesh, who strived to build
a self-sufficient Palestinian economy
by encouraging women in Gaza
to grow vegetables in their backyards,
an activity deemed illegal
by the Israeli authorities at that time;
Rabeha Diab, who took over
decision-making authority
for the entire uprising
when the men who had been running it
were deported;
Fatima Al Jaafari, who swallowed leaflets
containing the uprising's directives
in order to spread them
across the territories
without getting caught;
and Zahira Kamal,
who ensured the longevity of the uprising
by leading an organization
that went from 25 women
to 3,000 in a single year.
Despite their extraordinary achievements,
none of these women have made it
into our narrative of the First Intifada.
We do this in other parts
of the globe, too.
In our history books, for instance,
and in our collective consciousness,
men are the public faces and spokespersons
for the 1960s struggle
for racial justice in the United States.
But women were also
a critical driving force,
mobilizing, organizing,
taking to the streets.
How many of us think of Septima Clark
when we think of the United States
Civil Rights era?
Remarkably few.
But she played a crucial role
in every phase of the struggle,
particularly by emphasizing
literacy and education.
She's been omitted, ignored,
like so many other women
who played critical roles
in the United States
Civil Rights Movement.
This is not about getting credit.
It's more profound than that.
The stories we tell matter deeply
to how we see ourselves,
and to how we believe movements are run
and how movements are won.
The stories we tell about a movement
like the First Intifada
or the United States Civil Rights era
matter deeply
and have a critical influence
in the choices Palestinians,
Americans
and people around the world will make
next time they encounter an injustice
and develop the courage to confront it.
If we do not lift up the women who played
critical roles in these struggles,
we fail to offer up role models
to future generations.
Without role models, it becomes harder
for women to take up their rightful space
in public life.
And as we saw earlier,
one of the most critical variables
in determining whether
a movement will be successful or not
is a movement's ideology
regarding the role of women
in public life.
This is a question of whether we're moving
towards more democratic
and peaceful societies.
In a world where so much
change is happening,
and where change is bound to continue
at an increasingly faster pace,
it is not a question
of whether we will face conflict,
but rather a question
of which stories will shape
how we choose to wage conflict.
Thank you.
(Applause)
So, what I'm going to do is
just give you the latest episode of India's --
maybe the world's -- longest running soap opera,
which is cricket.
And may it run forever, because it gives people like me a living.
It's got everything that you'd want a normal soap opera to want:
It's got love, joy, happiness,
sadness, tears, laughter,
lots of deceit, intrigue.
And like all good soaps, it jumps 20 years
when the audience interest changes.
And that's exactly what cricket has done.
It's jumped 20 years
into 20-over game.
And that's what I'm going to talk about,
how a small change
leads to a very big revolution.
But it wasn't always like that.
Cricket wasn't always this
speed-driven generations game.
There was a time when you played cricket,
you played timeless test matches,
when you played on till the game got over.
And there was this game in March 1939
that started on the third of March
and ended on the 14th of March.
And it only ended because the English cricketers
had to go from Durban to Cape Town,
which is a two-hour train journey,
to catch the ship that left on the 17th,
because the next ship wasn't around for a long time.
So, the match was ended in between.
And one of the English batsmen said, "You know what?
Another half an hour and we would have won."
(Laughter)
Another half an hour after 12 days.
There were two Sundays in between. But of course, Sundays are church days,
so you don't play on Sundays. And one day it rained,
so they all sat around making friends with each other.
But there is a reason why India fell in love with cricket:
because we had about the same pace of life.
(Laughter)
The Mahabharata was like that as well, wasn't it?
You fought by day, then it was sunset,
so everyone went back home.
And then you worked out your strategy,
and you came and fought the next day, and you went back home again.
The only difference between the Mahabharata and our cricket was
that in cricket, everybody was alive to come back and fight the next day.
Princes patronize the game,
not because they love the game,
but because it was a means of ingratiating themselves
to the British rulers.
But there is one other reason why India fell in love with cricket,
which was, all you needed was a plank of wood
and a rubber ball, and any number of people
could play it anywhere.
Take a look:
You could play it in the dump
with some rocks over there,
you could play it in a little alley --
you couldn't hit square anywhere, because the bat hit the wall;
don't forget the air conditioning and the cable wires.
(Laughter)
You could play it on the banks of the Ganges --
that's as clean as the Ganges has been for a long time.
Or you could play many games in one small patch of land,
even if you didn't know which game you were actually in.
(Laughter)
As you can see, you can play anywhere.
But slowly the game moved on,
you know, finally.
You don't always have five days. So, we moved on,
and we started playing 50-over cricket.
And then an enormous accident took place.
In Indian sport we don't make things happen,
accidents happen and we're in the right place at the right time, sometimes.
And we won this World Cup in 1983.
And suddenly we fell in love with the 50-over game,
and we played it virtually every day.
There was more 50-over cricket than anywhere.
But there was another big date.
1983 was when we won the World Cup.
1991,'92, we found a finance minister
and a prime minister
willing to let the world look at India,
rather than be this great country of intrigue
and mystery in this closed country.
And so we allowed multinationals into India.
We cut customs duties, we reduced import duties,
and we got all the multinationals coming in,
with multinational budgets,
who looked at per-capita income
and got very excited about the possibilities in India,
and were looking for a vehicle to reach every Indian.
And there are only two vehicles in India -- one real, one scripted.
The scripted one is what you see in the movies,
the real one was cricket.
And so one of my friends sitting right here in front of me,
Ravi Dhariwal from Pepsi, decided he's going to take it
all over the world.
And Pepsi was this big revolution, because they started taking cricket all over.
And so cricket started becoming big;
cricket started bringing riches in.
Television started covering cricket. For a long time
television said, "We won't cover cricket
unless you pay us to cover it."
Then they said, "OK,
the next rights are sold for 55 million dollars.
The next rights are sold for 612 million dollars."
So, it's a bit of a curve, that.
And then another big accident happened in our cricket.
England invented 20 overs cricket,
and said, "The world must play 20 overs cricket."
Just as England invented cricket, and made the rest of the world play it.
Thank God for them.
(Laughter)
And so, India had to go and play the T20 World Cup, you see.
India didn't want to play the T20 World Cup.
But we were forced to play it by an 8-1 margin.
And then something very dramatic happened.
We got to the final, and then this moment,
that will remain enshrined forever,
for everybody, take a look.
(Crowd cheering)
The Pakistani batsman trying to clear the fielder.
Announcer: And Zishan takes it! India wins!
What a match for a Twenty20 final.
India, the world champions.
(Cheering)
India, T20 champions.
But what a game we had, M. S. Dhoni
got it right in the air, but Misbah-ul-Haq, what a player.
A massive, massive success:
India, the world TT champions.
Harsha Bhogle: Suddenly India discovered this power of 20-overs cricket.
The accident, of course, there, was that the batsman
thought the bowler was bowling fast.
(Laughter)
If he had bowled fast, the ball would have gone where it was meant to go,
but it didn't go. And we suddenly discovered
that we could be good at this game.
And what it also did was
it led to a certain pride in the fact that India could be the best in the world.
It was at a time when investment was coming in,
India was feeling a little more confident about itself.
And so there was a feeling that there was great pride
in what we can do.
And thankfully for all of us,
the English are very good at inventing things,
and then the gracious people that they are,
they let the world become very good at it.
(Laughter)
And so England invented T20 cricket,
and allowed India to hijack it.
It was not like reengineering that we do in medicine,
we just took it straight away, as is.
(Laughter)
And so, we launched our own T20 league.
Six weeks, city versus city.
It was a new thing for us. We had only ever supported our country --
the only two areas in which India was very proud about
their country, representing itself on the field.
One was war, the Indian army, which we don't like to happen very often.
The other was Indian cricket.
Now, suddenly we had to support city leagues.
But the people getting into these city leagues
were people who were taking their cues from the West.
America is a home of leagues. And they said,
"Right, we'll build some glitzy leagues here in India."
But was India ready for it?
Because cricket, for a long time in India was always organized.
It was never promoted, it was never sold -- it was organized.
And look what they did with our beautiful, nice,
simple family game.
All of a sudden, you had that happening.
(Music)
An opening ceremony to match every other.
This was an India that was buying Corvettes. This was an India that was buying Jaguar.
This was an India that was adding more mobile phones per month
than New Zealand's population twice over.
So, it was a different India.
But it was also a slightly more orthodox India
that was very happy to be modern,
but didn't want to say that to people.
And so, they were aghast when the cheerleaders arrived.
Everyone secretly watched them, but everyone claimed not to.
(Music)
(Laughter)
The new owners of Indian cricket were not the old princes.
They were not bureaucrats who were forced
into sport because they didn't actually love it;
these were people who ran serious companies.
And so they started promoting cricket big time,
started promoting clubs big time.
And they've started promoting them with huge money behind it.
I mean the IPL had 2.3 billion dollars
before a ball was bowled,
1.6 billion dollars for television revenue over 10 years,
and another 70 million dollars plus from all these franchises
that were putting in money. And then they had to appeal to their cities,
but they had to do it like the West, right? Because we are setting up leagues.
But what they were very good at doing
was making it very localized.
So, just to give you an example of how they did it --
not Manchester United style promotion,
but very Mumbai style promotion. Take a look.
(Music)
Of course, a lot of people said, "Maybe they dance better than they play."
(Laughter)
But that's all right. What it did also is it changed the way we looked at cricket.
All along, if you wanted a young cricketer,
you picked him up from the bylanes of your own little locality,
your own city, and you were very proud
of the system that produced those cricketers.
Now, all of the sudden, if you were to bowl a shot --
if Mumbai were to bowl a shot, for example,
they needn't go to Kalbadevi
or Shivaji Park or somewhere to source them,
they could go to Trinidad.
This was the new India, wasn't it? This was the new world,
where you can source from anywhere
as long as you get the best product at the best price.
And all of a sudden, Indian sport had awakened to the reality
that you can source the best product for the best price
anywhere in the world.
So, the Mumbai Indians flew in Dwayne Bravo from Trinidad and Tobago,
overnight. And when he had to go back to represent
the West Indies, they asked him, "When do you have to reach?"
He said, "I have to be there by a certain time, so I have to leave today."
We said, "No, no, no. It's not about when you have to leave;
it's about when do you have to reach there?"
And so he said, "I've got to reach on date X."
And they said, "Fine, you play to date X, minus one."
So, he played in Hyderabad, went, straight after the game,
went from the stadium to Hyderabad airport,
sat in a private corporate jet -- first refueling in Portugal,
second refueling in Brazil; he was in West Indies in time.
(Laughter)
Never would India have thought on this scale before.
Never would India have said, "I want a player to play
one game for me, and I will use a corporate jet
to send him all the way back to Kingston, Jamaica
to play a game."
And I just thought to myself,
"Wow, we've arrived somewhere in the world, you know?
We have arrived somewhere. We are thinking big."
But what this also did was it started
marrying the two most important things in Indian cricket,
which is cricket and the movies in Indian entertainment.
There is cricket and the movies.
And they came together because people in the movies
now started owning clubs.
And so, people started going to the cricket to watch Preity Zinta.
They started going to the cricket to watch Shah Rukh Khan.
And something very interesting happened.
We started getting song and dance in Indian cricket.
And so it started resembling the Indian movies more and more.
And of course, if you were on Preity Zinta's team --
as you will see on the clip that follows -- if you did well,
you got a hug from Preity Zinta.
So that was the ultimate reason to do well. Take a look --
everyone's watching Preity Zinta.
(Music)
And then of course there was Shah Rukh playing the Kolkata crowd.
We'd all seen matches in Kolkata,
but we'd never seen anything like this:
Shah Rukh, with the Bengali song, getting the audiences all worked up
for Kolkata -- not for India, but for Kolkata.
But take a look at this.
(Music)
An Indian film star hugging a Pakistani cricketer
because they'd won in Kolkata.
Can you imagine?
And do you know what the Pakistani cricketer said?
(Applause)
"I wish I was playing for Preity Zinta's team."
(Laughter)
But I thought I'd take this opportunity --
there's a few people from Pakistan in here.
I'm so happy that you're here
because I think we can show that we can both be together and be friends, right?
We can play cricket together, we can be friends.
So thank you very much for coming, all of you from Pakistan.
(Applause)
There was criticism too because they said,
"Players are being bought and sold?
Are they grain?
Are they cattle?"
Because we had this auction, you see.
How do you fix a price for a player?
And so the auction that followed
literally had people saying,
"Bang! so many million dollars for so-and-so player."
There it is.
(Music)
Auctioneer: Going at 1,500,000 dollars. Chennai.
Shane Warne sold for 450,000 dollars.
HB: Suddenly, a game which earned its players 50 rupees a day --
so 250 rupees for a test match,
but if you finish in four days you only got 200.
The best Indian players who played every test match --
every one of the internationals, the top of the line players --
standard contracts are 220,000 dollars in a whole year.
Now they were getting 500,000 for six days' work.
Then Andrew Flintoff came by from England,
he got one and a half million dollars, and he went back and said,
"For four weeks, I'm earning more than Frank Lampard and Steven Gerrard,
and I'm earning more than the footballers, wow."
And where was he earning it from? From a little club in India.
Could you have imagined that day would come?
One and a half million dollars for six weeks' work.
That's not bad, is it?
So, at 2.3 billion dollars before the first ball was bowled.
What India was doing, though, was benchmarking
itself against the best in the world,
and it became a huge brand.
Lalit Modi was on the cover of Business Today.
IPL became the biggest brand in India
and, because our elections, had to be moved to South Africa,
and we had to start the tournament in three weeks.
Move a whole tournament to South Africa in three weeks.
But we did it. You know why?
Because no country works as slowly as we do
till three weeks before an event,
and nobody works fast as we do in the last three weeks.
(Applause)
Our population, which for a long time we thought was a problem,
suddenly became our biggest asset
because there were more people watching --
the huge consuming class --
everybody came to watch the cricket.
We'd also made cricket the only sport in India,
which is a pity, but in India every other sport
pushes cricket to become big,
which is a bit of a tragedy of our times.
Now, this last minute before I go --
there's a couple of side effects of all this.
For a long time, India was this country of poverty,
dust, beggars,
snake charmers, filth,
Delhi belly -- people heard Delhi belly stories before they came.
And, all of a sudden, India was this land of opportunity.
Cricketers all over the world said,
"You know, we love India. We love to play in India."
And that felt good, you know?
We said, "The dollar's quite powerful actually."
Can you imagine, you've got the dollar on view
and there's no Delhi belly in there anymore.
There's no filth, there's no beggars, all the snake charmers have vanished,
everybody's gone. This tells you how the capitalist world rules.
Right so, finally,
an English game that India usurped a little bit,
but T20 is going to be the next missionary in the world.
If you want to take the game around the world,
it's got to be the shortest form of the game.
You can't take a timeless test to China and sit through 14 days with no result in the end,
or you can't take it all over the world.
So that's what T20 is doing.
Hopefully, it'll make everyone richer, hopefully it'll make the game bigger
and hopefully it'll give cricket commentators more time in the business.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
(Applause)
(Music) This is the human test,
a test to see if you are a human.
Please raise your hand if something applies to you.
Are we agreed? Yes?
Then let's begin.
Have you ever eaten a booger
long past your childhood?
(Laughter)
It's okay, it's safe here.
Have you ever made a small, weird sound
when you remembered something embarrassing?
Have you ever purposely lowercased
the first letter of a text
in order to come across as sad or disappointed?
(Laughter)
Okay.
Have you ever ended a text with a period
as a sign of aggression? Okay. Period.
Have you ever laughed or smiled
when someone said something shitty to you
and then spent the rest of the day
wondering why you reacted that way?
Yes.
Have you ever seemed to lose your airplane ticket
a thousand times as you walked
from the check-in to the gate?
Yes.
Have you ever put on a pair of pants
and then much later realized that there was
a loose sock smushed up against your thigh?
(Laughter)
Good.
Have you ever tried to guess
someone else's password
so many times that it locked their account?
Mmm.
Have you ever had a nagging feeling that one day
you will be discovered as a fraud?
Yes, it's safe here.
Have you ever hoped that there was some ability
you hadn't discovered yet
that you were just naturally great at?
Mmm.
Have you ever broken something in real life,
and then found yourself looking
for an "undo" button in real life?
Have you ever misplaced your TED badge
and then immediately started imagining
what a three-day Vancouver
vacation might look like?
Have you ever marveled
at how someone you thought was so ordinary
could suddenly become so beautiful?
Have you ever stared at your phone
smiling like an idiot while texting with someone?
Have you ever subsequently texted that person
the phrase "I'm staring at the phone
smiling like an idiot"?
Have you ever been tempted to,
and then gave in to the temptation,
of looking through someone else's phone?
Have you ever had a conversation with yourself
and then suddenly realized
you're a real asshole to yourself?
(Laughter)
Has your phone ever run out of battery
in the middle of an argument,
and it sort of felt like the phone
was breaking up with both of you?
Have you ever thought
that working on an issue between you was futile
because it should just be easier than this,
or this is supposed to happen just naturally?
Have you ever realized that very little, in the long run,
just happens naturally?
Have you ever woken up blissfully
and suddenly been flooded
by the awful remembrance
that someone had left you?
Have you ever lost the ability to imagine a future
without a person
that no longer was in your life?
Have you ever looked back on that event
with the sad smile of autumn
and the realization that futures will happen
regardless?
Congratulations.
You have now completed the test.
You are all human.
(Applause)
I grew up white, secular and middle class
in 1950s America.
That meant watching fireworks
on the Fourth of July,
trick-or-treating on Halloween
and putting presents
under a tree at Christmas.
But by the time
those traditions got to me,
they were hollow, commercial enterprises,
which just left me feeling empty.
So from a relatively young age,
I found myself looking to fill
an existential hole,
to connect with something
bigger than myself.
There hadn't been a bar mitzvah
in my family in over a century,
so I thought I'd take a shot at that --
(Laughter)
only to be devastated
when my one encounter with the rabbi,
a really tall, godlike figure
with flowing white hair,
consisted of him asking me
for my middle name
so we could fill out a form.
Yep, that was it.
(Laughter)
So I got the fountain pen,
but I didn't get the sense
of belonging and confidence
I was searching for.
Many years later,
I couldn't bear the thought
of my son turning 13
without some kind of rite of passage.
So I came up with the idea
of a 13th birthday trip,
and I offered to take Murphy
anywhere in the world
that had meaning for him.
A budding young naturalist
who loved turtles,
he immediately settled on the Galapagos.
And when my daughter, Katie, turned 13,
she and I spent two weeks
at the bottom of the Grand Canyon,
where Katie learned for the first time
that she was powerful and brave.
Since then, my partner, Ashton,
and lots of our friends and relatives
have taken their kids
on 13th birthday trips,
with everyone finding it transformative
for both the child and the parent.
I wasn't brought up saying grace.
But for the last 20 years,
we've been holding hands
before every meal.
It's a beautiful bit of shared silence
that brings us all together in the moment.
Ashton tells everyone
to "pass the squeeze,"
while she assures them it's not religious.
(Laughter)
So recently, when my family asked me
if I could please do something
with the more than 250 boxes of stuff
that I've collected over a lifetime,
my ritual-making impulse kicked in.
I started wondering if I could go further
than simple death cleaning.
"Death cleaning" is the Swedish term
for clearing out your closets,
your basement and your attic
before you die,
so your kids don't have to do it later.
(Laughter)
I pictured my children
opening up box after box
and wondering why I'd kept
any of that stuff.
(Laughter)
And then I imagined them looking
at a specific picture
of me with a beautiful young woman,
and asking, "Who on earth
is that with Dad?"
(Laughter)
And that was the aha moment.
It wasn't the things I'd saved
that were important;
it was the stories that went with them
that gave them meaning.
Could using the objects
to tell the stories
be the seed of a new ritual,
a rite of passage --
not for a 13-year-old,
but for someone much further
down the road?
So I started experimenting.
I got a few dozen things out of the boxes,
I put them about in a room,
and I invited people to come in
and ask me about anything
that they found interesting.
The results were terrific.
A good story became a launching pad
for a much deeper discussion,
in which my visitors made
meaningful connections
to their own lives.
Derrius [Quarles] asked me
about a Leonard Peltier T-shirt
that I'd worn a lot in the '80s,
that, sadly, is still relevant today.
Our conversation moved quickly,
from a large number of political
prisoners in American jails,
to Derrius wondering about the legacy
of the Black Liberation
Movement of the '60s,
and how his life might be different
if he'd come of age then,
instead of 30-odd years later.
At the end of our conversation,
Derrius asked me
if he could have the T-shirt.
And giving it to him felt
just about perfect.
As these conversations
established common ground,
especially across generations,
I realized I was opening a space
for people to talk about things
that really mattered to them.
And I started seeing myself
with a renewed sense of purpose --
not as the old guy on the way out,
but as someone with a role to play
going forward.
When I was growing up,
life ended for most people in their 70s.
People are living far longer now,
and for the first time in human history,
it's common for four generations
to be living side by side.
I'm 71,
and with a bit of luck,
I've got 20 or 30 more years ahead of me.
Giving away my stuff now
and sharing it with friends, family,
and I hope strangers, too,
seems like the perfect way
to enter this next stage of my life.
Turns out to be just
what I was looking for:
a ritual that's less about dying
and more about opening the door
to whatever comes next.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Onward!
(Applause)
I was only four years old
when I saw my mother load a washing machine
for the very first time in her life.
That was a great day for my mother.
My mother and father had been saving money for years
to be able to buy that machine,
and the first day it was going to be used,
even Grandma was invited
to see the machine.
And Grandma was even more excited.
Throughout her life
she had been heating water with firewood,
and she had hand washed laundry
for seven children.
And now she was going to watch
electricity do that work.
My mother carefully opened the door,
and she loaded the laundry
into the machine,
like this.
And then, when she closed the door,
Grandma said, "No, no, no, no.
Let me, let me push the button."
And Grandma pushed the button,
and she said, "Oh, fantastic!
I want to see this! Give me a chair!
Give me a chair! I want to see it,"
and she sat down in front of the machine,
and she watched the entire washing program.
She was mesmerized.
To my grandmother,
the washing machine was a miracle.
Today, in Sweden and other rich countries,
people are using
so many different machines.
Look, the homes are full of machines.
I can't even name them all.
And they also, when they want to travel,
they use flying machines
that can take them to remote destinations.
And yet, in the world, there are so many people
who still heat the water on fire,
and they cook their food on fire.
Sometimes they don't even have enough food,
and they live below the poverty line.
There are two billion fellow human beings
who live on less than two dollars a day.
And the richest people over there --
there's one billion people --
and they live above what I call the "air line,"
because they spend more than $80 a day
on their consumption.
But this is just one, two, three billion people,
and obviously there are seven billion people in the world,
so there must be one, two, three, four billion people more
who live in between the poverty and the air line.
They have electricity,
but the question is, how many have washing machines?
I've done the scrutiny of market data,
and I've found that, indeed,
the washing machine has penetrated below the air line,
and today there's an additional one billion people out there
who live above the "wash line."
(Laughter)
And they consume more than $40 per day.
So two billion have access to washing machines.
And the remaining five billion,
how do they wash?
Or, to be more precise,
how do most of the women in the world wash?
Because it remains hard work for women to wash.
They wash like this: by hand.
It's a hard, time-consuming labor,
which they have to do for hours every week.
And sometimes they also have to bring water from far away
to do the laundry at home,
or they have to bring the laundry away to a stream far off.
And they want the washing machine.
They don't want to spend such a large part of their life
doing this hard work
with so relatively low productivity.
And there's nothing different in their wish
than it was for my grandma.
Look here, two generations ago in Sweden --
picking water from the stream,
heating with firewood and washing like that.
They want the washing machine in exactly the same way.
But when I lecture to environmentally-concerned students,
they tell me, "No, everybody in the world cannot have cars and washing machines."
How can we tell this woman
that she ain't going to have a washing machine?
And then I ask my students,
I've asked them -- over the last two years I've asked,
"How many of you doesn't use a car?"
And some of them proudly raise their hand
and say, "I don't use a car."
And then I put the really tough question:
"How many of you
hand-wash your jeans and your bed sheets?"
And no one raised their hand.
Even the hardcore in the green movement
use washing machines.
(Laughter)
So how come [this is] something that everyone uses
and they think others will not stop it? What is special with this?
I had to do an analysis about the energy used in the world.
Here we are.
Look here, you see the seven billion people up there:
the air people, the wash people,
the bulb people and the fire people.
One unit like this
is an energy unit of fossil fuel --
oil, coal or gas.
That's what most of electricity and the energy in the world is.
And it's 12 units used in the entire world,
and the richest one billion, they use six of them.
Half of the energy is used by one seventh of the world's population.
And these ones who have washing machines,
but not a house full of other machines,
they use two.
This group uses three, one each.
And they also have electricity.
And over there they don't even use one each.
That makes 12 of them.
But the main concern
for the environmentally-interested students -- and they are right --
is about the future.
What are the trends? If we just prolong the trends,
without any real advanced analysis, to 2050,
there are two things that can increase the energy use.
First, population growth.
Second, economic growth.
Population growth will mainly occur among the poorest people here
because they have high child mortality
and they have many children per woman.
And [with] that you will get two extra,
but that won't change the energy use very much.
What will happen is economic growth.
The best of here in the emerging economies --
I call them the New East --
they will jump the air line.
"Wopp!" they will say.
And they will start to use as much as the Old West are doing already.
And these people, they want the washing machine.
I told you. They'll go there.
And they will double their energy use.
And we hope that the poor people will get into the electric light.
And they'll get a two-child family without a stop in population growth.
But the total energy consumption
will increase to 22 units.
And these 22 units --
still the richest people use most of it.
So what needs to be done?
Because the risk,
the high probability of climate change is real.
It's real.
Of course they must be more energy-efficient.
They must change behavior in some way.
They must also start to produce green energy,
much more green energy.
But until they have the same energy consumption per person,
they shouldn't give advice to others --
what to do and what not to do.
(Applause)
Here we can get more green energy all over.
This is what we hope may happen.
It's a real challenge in the future.
But I can assure you that this woman in the favela in Rio,
she wants a washing machine.
She's very happy about her minister of energy
that provided electricity to everyone --
so happy that she even voted for her.
And she became Dilma Rousseff,
the president-elect
of one of the biggest democracies in the world --
moving from minister of energy to president.
If you have democracy,
people will vote for washing machines.
They love them.
And what's the magic with them?
My mother explained the magic with this machine
the very, very first day.
She said, "Now Hans,
we have loaded the laundry.
The machine will make the work.
And now we can go to the library."
Because this is the magic:
you load the laundry,
and what do you get out of the machine?
You get books out of the machines,
children's books.
And mother got time to read for me.
She loved this. I got the "ABC's" --
this is where I started my career as a professor,
when my mother had time to read for me.
And she also got books for herself.
She managed to study English
and learn that as a foreign language.
And she read so many novels,
so many different novels here.
And we really, we really loved this machine.
And what we said, my mother and me,
"Thank you industrialization.
Thank you steel mill.
Thank you power station.
And thank you chemical processing industry
that gave us time to read books."
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
Basically, there's a major demographic event going on.
And it may be that passing the 50 percent urban point
is an economic tipping point. So the world now is a map of connectivity.
It used to be that Paris and London and New York were the largest cities.
What we have now is the end of the rise of the West. That's over.
The aggregate numbers are overwhelming.
So what's really going on? Well, villages of the world are emptying out.
The question is, why?
And here's the unromantic truth -- and the city air makes you free,
they said in Renaissance Germany. So some people go to places
like Shanghai but most go to the squatter cities where aesthetics rule.
And these are not really a people oppressed by poverty.
They're people getting out of poverty as fast as they can.
They're the dominant builders and to a large extent, the dominant designers.
They have home-brewed infrastructure and vibrant urban life.
One-sixth of the GDP in India is coming out of Mumbai.
They are constantly upgrading, and in a few cases, the government helps.
Education is the main event that can happen in cities.
What's going on in the street in Mumbai?
Al Gore knows. It's basically everything.
There's no unemployment in squatter cities. Everyone works.
One-sixth of humanity is there. It's soon going to be more than that.
So here's the first punch line:
cities have defused the population bomb.
And here's the second punch line.
That's the news from downtown. Here it is in perspective.
Stars have shined down on earth's life for billions of years.
Now we're shining right back up.
Thank you.
I'm Jessi, and this is my suitcase.
But before I show you what I've got inside,
I'm going to make a very public confession,
and that is,
I'm outfit-obsessed.
I love finding, wearing,
and more recently,
photographing and blogging
a different, colorful, crazy outfit
for every single occasion.
But I don't buy anything new.
I get all my clothes secondhand
from flea markets and thrift stores.
Aww, thank you.
Secondhand shopping
allows me to reduce the impact
my wardrobe has on the environment
and on my wallet.
I get to meet all kinds of great people;
my dollars usually go to a good cause;
I look pretty unique;
and it makes shopping like my own personal treasure hunt.
I mean, what am I going to find today?
Is it going to be my size?
Will I like the color?
Will it be under $20?
If all the answers are yes,
I feel as though I've won.
I want to get back to my suitcase
and tell you what I packed
for this exciting week here at TED.
I mean, what does somebody with all these outfits bring with her?
So I'm going to show you exactly what I brought.
I brought seven pairs of underpants
and that's it.
Exactly one week's worth of undies
is all I put in my suitcase.
I was betting that I'd be able to find
everything else I could possible want to wear
once I got here to Palm Springs.
And since you don't know me
as the woman walking around TED in her underwear --
(Laughter)
that means I found a few things.
And I'd really love to show you my week's worth of outfits right now.
Does that sound good?
(Applause)
So as I do this,
I'm also going to tell you a few of the life lessons
that, believe it or not, I have picked up
in these adventures wearing nothing new.
So let's start with Sunday.
I call this "Shiny Tiger."
You do not have to spend a lot of money to look great.
You can almost always look phenomenal for under $50.
This whole outfit, including the jacket,
cost me $55,
and it was the most expensive thing
that I wore the entire week.
Monday: Color is powerful.
It is almost physiologically impossible
to be in a bad mood when you're wearing bright red pants.
(Laughter)
If you are happy,
you are going to attract other happy people to you.
Tuesday:
Fitting in is way overrated.
I've spent a whole lot of my life
trying to be myself
and at the same time fit in.
Just be who you are.
If you are surrounding yourself with the right people,
they will not only get it,
they will appreciate it.
Wednesday:
Embrace your inner child.
Sometimes people tell me
that I look like I'm playing dress-up,
or that I remind them of their seven-year-old.
I like to smile
and say, "Thank you."
Thursday:
Confidence is key.
If you think you look good in something,
you almost certainly do.
And if you don't think you look good in something,
you're also probably right.
I grew up with a mom who taught me this day-in and day-out.
But it wasn't until I turned 30
that I really got what this meant.
And I'm going to break it down for you for just a second.
If you believe you're a beautiful person
inside and out,
there is no look that you can't pull off.
So there is no excuse for any of us here in this audience.
We should be able to rock anything we want to rock.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Friday: A universal truth -- five words for you:
Gold sequins go with everything.
And finally, Saturday:
Developing your own unique personal style
is a really great way to tell the world something about you
without having to say a word.
It's been proven to me time and time again
as people have walked up to me this week
simply because of what I'm wearing,
and we've had great conversations.
So obviously this is not all going to fit
back in my tiny suitcase.
So before I go home to Brooklyn,
I'm going to donate everything back.
Because the lesson I'm trying to learn myself this week
is that it's okay to let go.
I don't need to get emotionally attached to these things
because around the corner,
there is always going to be
another crazy, colorful,
shiny outfit
just waiting for me,
if I put a little love in my heart and look.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
Thank you.
(Applause)
I want us to start
by thinking about this device,
the phone that's very likely
in your pockets right now.
Over 40 percent of Americans 
check their phones
within five minutes
of waking up every morning.
And then they look at it
another 50 times during the day.
Grownups consider this device
to be a necessity.
But now I want you to imagine it
in the hands of a three-year-old,
and as a society, we get anxious.
Parents are very worried
that this device is going to stunt
their children's social growth;
that it's going to keep them
from getting up and moving;
that somehow,
this is going to disrupt childhood.
So, I want to challenge this attitude.
I can envision a future
where we would be excited to see
a preschooler interacting with a screen.
These screens can get kids
up and moving even more.
They have the power to tell us more
about what a child is learning
than a standardized test can.
And here's the really crazy thought:
I believe that these screens
have the power
to prompt more real-life conversations
between kids and their parents.
Now, I was perhaps
an unlikely champion for this cause.
I studied children's literature
because I was going to work
with kids and books.
But about 20 years ago,
I had an experience that shifted my focus.
I was helping lead a research study
about preschoolers and websites.
And I walked in and was assigned
a three-year-old named Maria.
Maria had actually never seen
a computer before.
So the first thing I had to do
was teach her how to use the mouse,
and when I opened up the screen,
she moved it across the screen,
and she stopped on a character
named X the Owl.
And when she did that,
the owl lifted his wing and waved at her.
Maria dropped the mouse,
pushed back from the table, leaped up
and started waving
frantically back at him.
Her connection to that character
was visceral.
This wasn't a passive screen experience.
This was a human experience.
And it was exactly appropriate
for a three-year-old.
I've now worked at PBS Kids
for more than 15 years,
and my work there is focused on
harnessing the power of technology
as a positive in children's lives.
I believe that as a society,
we're missing a big opportunity.
We're letting our fear and our skepticism
about these devices
hold us back from realizing
their potential
in our children's lives.
Fear about kids and technology
is nothing new;
we've been here before.
Over 50 years ago, the debate was raging
about the newly dominant media:
the television.
That box in the living room?
It might be separating kids
from one another.
It might keep them away
from the outside world.
But this is the moment when Fred Rogers,
the long-running host
of "Mister Rogers' Neighborhood,"
challenged society
to look at television as a tool,
a tool that could promote
emotional growth.
Here's what he did:
he looked out from the screen,
and he held a conversation,
as if he were speaking
to each child individually
about feelings.
And then he would pause
and let them think about them.
You can see his influence
across the media landscape today,
but at the time, this was revolutionary.
He shifted the way we looked at television
in the lives of children.
Today it's not just one box.
Kids are surrounded by devices.
And I'm also a parent -- I understand
this feeling of anxiety.
But I want us to look
at three common fears
that parents have,
and see if we can shift our focus
to the opportunity that's in each of them.
So.
Fear number one:
"Screens are passive.
This is going to keep our kids
from getting up and moving."
Chris Kratt and Martin Kratt
are zoologist brothers
who host a show about animals
called "Wild Kratts."
And they approached the PBS team to say,
"Can we do something with those cameras
that are built into every device now?
Could those cameras capture
a very natural kid play pattern --
pretending to be animals?"
So we started with bats.
And when kids came in to play this game,
they loved seeing themselves
on-screen with wings.
But my favorite part of this,
when the game was over
and we turned off the screens?
The kids kept being bats.
They kept flying around the room,
they kept veering left and right
to catch mosquitoes.
And they remembered things.
They remembered that bats fly at night.
And they remembered that when bats sleep,
they hang upside down
and fold their wings in.
This game definitely got kids
up and moving.
But also, now when kids go outside,
do they look at a bird and think,
"How does a bird fly
differently than I flew
when I was a bat?"
The digital technology prompted
embodied learning
that kids can now take out into the world.
Fear number two:
"Playing games on these screens
is just a waste of time.
It's going to distract children
from their education."
Game developers know
that you can learn a lot
about a player's skill
by looking at the back-end data:
Where did a player pause?
Where did they make a few mistakes
before they found the right answer?
My team wanted to take that tool set
and apply it to academic learning.
Our producer in Boston, WGBH,
created a series of Curious George games
focused on math.
And researchers came in and had
80 preschoolers play these games.
They then gave all 80
of those preschoolers
a standardized math test.
We could see early on
that these games
were actually helping kids
understand some key skills.
But our partners at UCLA
wanted us to dig deeper.
They focus on data analysis
and student assessment.
And they wanted to take
that back-end game-play data
and see if they could use it
to predict a child's math scores.
So they made a neural net --
they essentially trained the computer
to use this data,
and here are the results.
This is a subset of the children's
standardized math scores.
And this
is the computer's prediction
of each child's score,
based on playing
some Curious George games.
The prediction is astonishingly accurate,
especially considering the fact
that these games weren't built
for assessment.
The team that did this study
believes that games like these
can teach us more
about a child's cognitive learning
than a standardized test can.
What if games could reduce
testing time in the classroom?
What if they could reduce testing anxiety?
How could they give teachers
snapshots of insight
to help them better focus
their individualized learning?
So the third fear I want to address
is the one that I think
is often the biggest.
And that's this:
"These screens are isolating me
from my child."
Let's play out a scenario.
Let's say that you are a parent,
and you need 25 minutes
of uninterrupted time
to get dinner ready.
And in order to do that,
you hand a tablet to your three-year-old.
Now, this is a moment
where you probably feel very guilty
about what you just did.
But now imagine this:
Twenty minutes later,
you receive a text message.
on that cell phone
that's always within arm's reach.
And it says: "Alex just matched
five rhyming words.
Ask him to play this game with you.
Can you think of a word
that rhymes with 'cat'?
Or how about 'ball'?"
In our studies, when parents receive
simple tips like these,
they felt empowered.
They were so excited
to play these games
at the dinner table with their kids.
And the kids loved it, too.
Not only did it feel like magic
that their parents knew
what they had been playing,
kids love to play games
with their parents.
Just the act of talking to kids
about their media
can be incredibly powerful.
Last summer, Texas Tech University
published a study
that the show "Daniel Tiger's
Neighborhood" could promote
the development of empathy among children.
But there was a really important
catch to this study:
the greatest benefit was only
when parents talked to kids
about what they watched.
Neither just watching
nor just talking about it was enough;
it was the combination that was key.
So when I read this study,
I started thinking about
how rarely parents of preschoolers
actually talk to kids about the content
of what they're playing
and what they're watching.
And so I decided to try it
with my four-year-old.
I said,
"Were you playing a car game
earlier today?"
And Benjamin perked up and said,
"Yes! And did you see
that I made my car out of a pickle?
It was really hard to open the trunk."
(Laughter)
This hilarious conversation
about what was fun in the game
and what could have been better
continued all the way
to school that morning.
I'm not here to suggest to you
that all digital media is great for kids.
There are legitimate reasons
for us to be concerned
about the current state
of children's content
on these screens.
And it's right for us
to be thinking about balance:
Where do screens fit
against all the other things
that a child needs to do
to learn and to grow?
But when we fixate on our fears about it,
we forget a really major point,
and that is, that kids are living
in the same world that we live in,
the world where the grownups
check their phones
more than 50 times a day.
Screens are a part of children's lives.
And if we pretend that they aren't,
or if we get overwhelmed by our fear,
kids are never going to learn
how and why to use them.
What if we start raising our expectations
for this media?
What if we start talking to kids regularly
about the content on these screens?
What if we start looking
for the positive impacts
that this technology can have
in our children's lives?
That's when the potential of these tools
can become a reality.
Thank you.
(Applause)
[On April 3, 2016 we saw
the largest data leak in history.]
[The Panama Papers exposed
rich and powerful people]
[hiding vast amounts of money
in offshore accounts.]
[What does this mean?]
[We called Robert Palmer
of Global Witness to explain.]
This week, there have been
a whole slew and deluge of stories
coming out from the leak
of 11 million documents
from a Panamanian-based law firm
called Mossack Fonseca.
The release of these papers from Panama
lifts the veil on a tiny piece
of the secretive offshore world.
We get an insight into how clients
and banks and lawyers
go to companies like Mossack Fonseca
and say, "OK, we want
an anonymous company,
can you give us one?"
So you actually get to see the emails,
you get to see the exchanges of messages,
you get to see the mechanics
of how this works,
how this operates.
Now, this has already started
to have pretty immediate repercussions.
The Prime Minister
of Iceland has resigned.
We've also had news
that an ally of the brutal
Syrian dictator Bashar Al-Assad
has also got offshore companies.
There's been allegations
of a $2 billion money trail
that leads back to President
Vladimir Putin of Russia
via his close childhood friend,
who happens to be a top cellist.
And there will be a lot
of rich individuals out there
and others who will be nervous
about the next set of stories
and the next set of leaked documents.
Now, this sounds like the plot
of a spy thriller
or a John Grisham novel.
It seems very distant
from you, me, ordinary people.
Why should we care about this?
But the truth is that if rich
and powerful individuals
are able to keep their money offshore
and not pay the taxes that they should,
it means that there is less money
for vital public services
like healthcare, education, roads.
And that affects all of us.
Now, for my organization Global Witness,
this exposé has been phenomenal.
We have the world's media
and political leaders
talking about how individuals
can use offshore secrecy
to hide and disguise their assets --
something we have been talking about
and exposing for a decade.
Now, I think a lot of people find
this entire world baffling and confusing,
and hard to understand how
this sort of offshore world works.
I like to think of it a bit
like a Russian doll.
So you can have one company
stacked inside another company,
stacked inside another company,
making it almost impossible
to really understand
who is behind these structures.
It can be very difficult
for law enforcement
or tax authorities,
journalists, civil society
to really understand what's going on.
I also think it's interesting
that there's been less coverage
of this issue in the United States.
And that's perhaps because
some prominent US people
just haven't figured
in this exposé, in this scandal.
Now, that's not because
there are no rich Americans
who are stashing their assets offshore.
It's just because of the way
in which offshore works,
Mossack Fonseca has fewer
American clients.
I think if we saw leaks
from the Cayman Islands
or even from Delaware
or Wyoming or Nevada,
you would see many more cases
and examples linking back to Americans.
In fact, in a number of US states
you need less information,
you need to provide less
information to get a company
than you do to get a library card.
That sort of secrecy in America
has allowed employees of school districts
to rip off schoolchildren.
It has allowed scammers
to rip off vulnerable investors.
This is the sort of behavior
that affects all of us.
Now, at Global Witness,
we wanted to see what this
actually looked like in practice.
How does this actually work?
So what we did
is we sent in an undercover investigator
to 13 Manhattan law firms.
Our investigator posed
as an African minister
who wanted to move suspect funds
into the United States
to buy a house, a yacht, a jet.
Now, what was truly shocking
was that all but one of those lawyers
provided our investigator with suggestions
on how to move those suspect funds.
These were all preliminary meetings,
and none of the lawyers
took us on as a client
and of course no money moved hands,
but it really shows the problem
with the system.
It's also important
to not just think about this
as individual cases.
This is not just about
an individual lawyer
who's spoken to our undercover
investigator and provided suggestions.
It's not just about
a particular senior politician
who's been caught up in a scandal.
This is about how a system works,
that entrenches corruption,
tax evasion, poverty and instability.
And in order to tackle this,
we need to change the game.
We need to change the rules of the game
to make this sort of behavior harder.
This may seem like doom and gloom,
like there's nothing we can do about it,
like nothing has ever changed,
like there will always be rich
and powerful individuals.
But as a natural optimist,
I do see that we are starting
to get some change.
Over the last couple of years,
we've seen a real push towards
greater transparency
when it comes to company ownership.
This issue was put on the political agenda
by the UK Prime Minister David Cameron
at a big G8 Summit that was held
in Northern Ireland in 2013.
And since then, the European Union
is going to be creating
central registers at a national level
of who really owns and controls
companies across Europe.
One of the things that is sad is that,
actually, the US is lagging behind.
There's bipartisan legislation
that had been introduced
in the House and the Senate,
but it isn't making as much progress
as we'd like to see.
So we'd really want to see
the Panama leaks,
this huge peek into the offshore world,
be used as a way of opening up
in the US and around the world.
For us at Global Witness,
this is a moment for change.
We need ordinary people to get angry
at the way in which people
can hide their identity
behind secret companies.
We need business leaders
to stand up and say,
"Secrecy like this is not
good for business."
We need political leaders
to recognize the problem,
and to commit to changing the law
to open up this sort of secrecy.
Together, we can end the secrecy
that is currently allowing tax evasion,
corruption, money laundering to flourish.
Hi.
I want to talk about understanding,
and the nature of understanding,
and what the essence of understanding is,
because understanding is something
we aim for, everyone.
We want to understand things.
My claim is that understanding has to do
with the ability to change
your perspective.
If you don't have that,
you don't have understanding.
So that is my claim.
And I want to focus on mathematics.
Many of us think of mathematics
as addition, subtraction,
multiplication, division,
fractions, percent, geometry,
algebra -- all that stuff.
But actually, I want to talk
about the essence of mathematics as well.
And my claim is that mathematics
has to do with patterns.
Behind me, you see a beautiful pattern,
and this pattern actually emerges
just from drawing circles
in a very particular way.
So my day-to-day definition
of mathematics that I use every day
is the following:
First of all, it's about finding patterns.
And by "pattern," I mean a connection,
a structure, some regularity,
some rules that govern what we see.
Second of all,
I think it is about representing
these patterns with a language.
We make up language if we don't have it,
and in mathematics, this is essential.
It's also about making assumptions
and playing around with these assumptions
and just seeing what happens.
We're going to do that very soon.
And finally, it's about doing cool stuff.
Mathematics enables us
to do so many things.
So let's have a look at these patterns.
If you want to tie a tie knot,
there are patterns.
Tie knots have names.
And you can also do
the mathematics of tie knots.
This is a left-out, right-in,
center-out and tie.
This is a left-in, right-out,
left-in, center-out and tie.
This is a language we made up
for the patterns of tie knots,
and a half-Windsor is all that.
This is a mathematics book
about tying shoelaces
at the university level,
because there are patterns in shoelaces.
You can do it in so many different ways.
We can analyze it.
We can make up languages for it.
And representations
are all over mathematics.
This is Leibniz's notation from 1675.
He invented a language
for patterns in nature.
When we throw something up in the air,
it falls down.
Why?
We're not sure, but we can represent
this with mathematics in a pattern.
This is also a pattern.
This is also an invented language.
Can you guess for what?
It is actually a notation system
for dancing, for tap dancing.
That enables him as a choreographer
to do cool stuff, to do new things,
because he has represented it.
I want you to think about how amazing
representing something actually is.
Here it says the word "mathematics."
But actually, they're just dots, right?
So how in the world can these dots
represent the word?
Well, they do.
They represent the word "mathematics,"
and these symbols also represent that word
and this we can listen to.
It sounds like this.
(Beeps)
Somehow these sounds represent
the word and the concept.
How does this happen?
There's something amazing
going on about representing stuff.
So I want to talk about
that magic that happens
when we actually represent something.
Here you see just lines
with different widths.
They stand for numbers
for a particular book.
And I can actually recommend
this book, it's a very nice book.
(Laughter)
Just trust me.
OK, so let's just do an experiment,
just to play around
with some straight lines.
This is a straight line.
Let's make another one.
So every time we move,
we move one down and one across,
and we draw a new straight line, right?
We do this over and over and over,
and we look for patterns.
So this pattern emerges,
and it's a rather nice pattern.
It looks like a curve, right?
Just from drawing simple, straight lines.
Now I can change my perspective
a little bit. I can rotate it.
Have a look at the curve.
What does it look like?
Is it a part of a circle?
It's actually not a part of a circle.
So I have to continue my investigation
and look for the true pattern.
Perhaps if I copy it and make some art?
Well, no.
Perhaps I should extend
the lines like this,
and look for the pattern there.
Let's make more lines.
We do this.
And then let's zoom out
and change our perspective again.
Then we can actually see that
what started out as just straight lines
is actually a curve called a parabola.
This is represented by a simple equation,
and it's a beautiful pattern.
So this is the stuff that we do.
We find patterns, and we represent them.
And I think this is a nice
day-to-day definition.
But today I want to go
a little bit deeper,
and think about
what the nature of this is.
What makes it possible?
There's one thing
that's a little bit deeper,
and that has to do with the ability
to change your perspective.
And I claim that when
you change your perspective,
and if you take another point of view,
you learn something new
about what you are watching
or looking at or hearing.
And I think this is a really important
thing that we do all the time.
So let's just look at
this simple equation,
x + x = 2 • x.
This is a very nice pattern,
and it's true,
because 5 + 5 = 2 • 5, etc.
We've seen this over and over,
and we represent it like this.
But think about it: this is an equation.
It says that something
is equal to something else,
and that's two different perspectives.
One perspective is, it's a sum.
It's something you plus together.
On the other hand, it's a multiplication,
and those are two different perspectives.
And I would go as far as to say
that every equation is like this,
every mathematical equation
where you use that equality sign
is actually a metaphor.
It's an analogy between two things.
You're just viewing something
and taking two different points of view,
and you're expressing that in a language.
Have a look at this equation.
This is one of the most
beautiful equations.
It simply says that, well,
two things, they're both -1.
This thing on the left-hand side is -1,
and the other one is.
And that, I think, is one
of the essential parts
of mathematics -- you take
different points of view.
So let's just play around.
Let's take a number.
We know four-thirds.
We know what four-thirds is.
It's 1.333, but we have to have
those three dots,
otherwise it's not exactly four-thirds.
But this is only in base 10.
You know, the number system,
we use 10 digits.
If we change that around
and only use two digits,
that's called the binary system.
It's written like this.
So we're now talking about the number.
The number is four-thirds.
We can write it like this,
and we can change the base,
change the number of digits,
and we can write it differently.
So these are all representations
of the same number.
We can even write it simply,
like 1.3 or 1.6.
It all depends on
how many digits you have.
Or perhaps we just simplify
and write it like this.
I like this one, because this says
four divided by three.
And this number expresses
a relation between two numbers.
You have four on the one hand
and three on the other.
And you can visualize this in many ways.
What I'm doing now is viewing that number
from different perspectives.
I'm playing around.
I'm playing around with
how we view something,
and I'm doing it very deliberately.
We can take a grid.
If it's four across and three up,
this line equals five, always.
It has to be like this.
This is a beautiful pattern.
Four and three and five.
And this rectangle, which is 4 x 3,
you've seen a lot of times.
This is your average computer screen.
800 x 600 or 1,600 x 1,200
is a television or a computer screen.
So these are all nice representations,
but I want to go a little bit further
and just play more with this number.
Here you see two circles.
I'm going to rotate them like this.
Observe the upper-left one.
It goes a little bit faster, right?
You can see this.
It actually goes exactly
four-thirds as fast.
That means that when it goes
around four times,
the other one goes around three times.
Now let's make two lines, and draw
this dot where the lines meet.
We get this dot dancing around.
(Laughter)
And this dot comes from that number.
Right? Now we should trace it.
Let's trace it and see what happens.
This is what mathematics is all about.
It's about seeing what happens.
And this emerges from four-thirds.
I like to say that this
is the image of four-thirds.
It's much nicer -- (Cheers)
Thank you!
(Applause)
This is not new.
This has been known
for a long time, but --
(Laughter)
But this is four-thirds.
Let's do another experiment.
Let's now take a sound, this sound: (Beep)
This is a perfect A, 440Hz.
Let's multiply it by two.
We get this sound. (Beep)
When we play them together,
it sounds like this.
This is an octave, right?
We can do this game. We can play
a sound, play the same A.
We can multiply it by three-halves.
(Beep)
This is what we call a perfect fifth.
(Beep)
They sound really nice together.
Let's multiply this sound
by four-thirds. (Beep)
What happens?
You get this sound. (Beep)
This is the perfect fourth.
If the first one is an A, this is a D.
They sound like this together. (Beeps)
This is the sound of four-thirds.
What I'm doing now,
I'm changing my perspective.
I'm just viewing a number
from another perspective.
I can even do this with rhythms, right?
I can take a rhythm and play
three beats at one time (Drumbeats)
in a period of time,
and I can play another sound
four times in that same space.
(Clanking sounds)
Sounds kind of boring,
but listen to them together.
(Drumbeats and clanking sounds)
(Laughter)
Hey! So.
(Laughter)
I can even make a little hi-hat.
(Drumbeats and cymbals)
Can you hear this?
So, this is the sound of four-thirds.
Again, this is as a rhythm.
(Drumbeats and cowbell)
And I can keep doing this
and play games with this number.
Four-thirds is a really great number.
I love four-thirds!
(Laughter)
Truly -- it's an undervalued number.
So if you take a sphere and look
at the volume of the sphere,
it's actually four-thirds
of some particular cylinder.
So four-thirds is in the sphere.
It's the volume of the sphere.
OK, so why am I doing all this?
Well, I want to talk about what it means
to understand something
and what we mean
by understanding something.
That's my aim here.
And my claim is that
you understand something
if you have the ability to view it
from different perspectives.
Let's look at this letter.
It's a beautiful R, right?
How do you know that?
Well, as a matter of fact,
you've seen a bunch of R's,
and you've generalized
and abstracted all of these
and found a pattern.
So you know that this is an R.
So what I'm aiming for here
is saying something
about how understanding
and changing your perspective
are linked.
And I'm a teacher and a lecturer,
and I can actually use this
to teach something,
because when I give someone else
another story, a metaphor, an analogy,
if I tell a story
from a different point of view,
I enable understanding.
I make understanding possible,
because you have to generalize
over everything you see and hear,
and if I give you another perspective,
that will become easier for you.
Let's do a simple example again.
This is four and three.
This is four triangles.
So this is also four-thirds, in a way.
Let's just join them together.
Now we're going to play a game;
we're going to fold it up
into a three-dimensional structure.
I love this.
This is a square pyramid.
And let's just take two of them
and put them together.
So this is what is called an octahedron.
It's one of the five platonic solids.
Now we can quite literally
change our perspective,
because we can rotate it
around all of the axes
and view it from different perspectives.
And I can change the axis,
and then I can view it
from another point of view,
but it's the same thing,
but it looks a little different.
I can do it even one more time.
Every time I do this,
something else appears,
so I'm actually learning
more about the object
when I change my perspective.
I can use this as a tool
for creating understanding.
I can take two of these
and put them together like this
and see what happens.
And it looks a little bit
like the octahedron.
Have a look at it if I spin
it around like this.
What happens?
Well, if you take two of these,
join them together and spin it around,
there's your octahedron again,
a beautiful structure.
If you lay it out flat on the floor,
this is the octahedron.
This is the graph structure
of an octahedron.
And I can continue doing this.
You can draw three great circles
around the octahedron,
and you rotate around,
so actually three great circles
is related to the octahedron.
And if I take a bicycle pump
and just pump it up,
you can see that this is also
a little bit like the octahedron.
Do you see what I'm doing here?
I am changing the perspective every time.
So let's now take a step back --
and that's actually
a metaphor, stepping back --
and have a look at what we're doing.
I'm playing around with metaphors.
I'm playing around
with perspectives and analogies.
I'm telling one story in different ways.
I'm telling stories.
I'm making a narrative;
I'm making several narratives.
And I think all of these things
make understanding possible.
I think this actually is the essence
of understanding something.
I truly believe this.
So this thing about changing
your perspective --
it's absolutely fundamental for humans.
Let's play around with the Earth.
Let's zoom into the ocean,
have a look at the ocean.
We can do this with anything.
We can take the ocean
and view it up close.
We can look at the waves.
We can go to the beach.
We can view the ocean
from another perspective.
Every time we do this, we learn
a little bit more about the ocean.
If we go to the shore,
we can kind of smell it, right?
We can hear the sound of the waves.
We can feel salt on our tongues.
So all of these
are different perspectives.
And this is the best one.
We can go into the water.
We can see the water from the inside.
And you know what?
This is absolutely essential
in mathematics and computer science.
If you're able to view
a structure from the inside,
then you really learn something about it.
That's somehow the essence of something.
So when we do this,
and we've taken this journey
into the ocean,
we use our imagination.
And I think this is one level deeper,
and it's actually a requirement
for changing your perspective.
We can do a little game.
You can imagine that you're sitting there.
You can imagine that you're up here,
and that you're sitting here.
You can view yourselves from the outside.
That's really a strange thing.
You're changing your perspective.
You're using your imagination,
and you're viewing yourself
from the outside.
That requires imagination.
Mathematics and computer science
are the most imaginative art forms ever.
And this thing about changing perspectives
should sound a little bit familiar to you,
because we do it every day.
And then it's called empathy.
When I view the world
from your perspective,
I have empathy with you.
If I really, truly understand
what the world looks
like from your perspective,
I am empathetic.
That requires imagination.
And that is how we obtain understanding.
And this is all over mathematics
and this is all over computer science,
and there's a really deep connection
between empathy and these sciences.
So my conclusion is the following:
understanding something really deeply
has to do with the ability
to change your perspective.
So my advice to you is:
try to change your perspective.
You can study mathematics.
It's a wonderful way to train your brain.
Changing your perspective
makes your mind more flexible.
It makes you open to new things,
and it makes you
able to understand things.
And to use yet another metaphor:
have a mind like water.
That's nice.
Thank you.
(Applause)
I live in Washington, D.C.,
but I grew up in Sindhekela, a village in Orissa,
in India.
My father was a government worker.
My mother could not read or write, but she
would say to me, "A king is 
worshipped only in his
own kingdom. A poet is respected everywhere."
So I wanted to be a poet when I grew up.
But I almost didn't go to college
until an aunt offered financial help.
I went to study in Sambalpur,
the largest town in the region,
where, already in college, I saw a
television for the first time.
I had dreams of going to the United States
for higher studies.
When the opportunity came,
I crossed two oceans, with borrowed money
for airfare and only a $20 bill in my pocket.
In the U.S., I worked in a research center,
part-time, while taking graduate classes in economics.
And with the little I earned, I would
finance myself and then I would send
money home to my brother and my father.
My story is not unique.
There are millions of people who migrate each year.
With the help of the family, they cross oceans,
they cross deserts, they cross 
rivers, they cross mountains.
They risk their lives to realize a dream,
and that dream is as simple as having a
decent job somewhere so they can send money home
and help the family,
which has helped them before.
There are 232 million international 
migrants in the world.
These are people who live in a country
other than their country of birth.
If there was a country made up of
only international migrants,
that would be larger, in population,
than Brazil.
That would be larger, in its size
of the economy, than France.
Some 180 million of them, from poor countries,
send money home regularly.
Those sums of money are called remittances.
Here is a fact that might surprise you:
413 billion dollars, 413 billion dollars
was the amount of remittances sent last year
by migrants to developing countries.
Migrants from developing countries,
money sent to developing countries —
413 billion dollars.
That's a remarkable number because
that is three times the size of
the total of development aid money.
And yet, you and I,
my colleagues in Washington,
we endlessly debate and
discuss about development aid,
while we ignore remittances as small change.
True, people send 200 dollars per month,
on average. But, repeated month after month,
by millions of people,
these sums of money add up to rivers 
of foreign currency.
So India, last year, received 72 
billion dollars, larger than
its IT exports.
In Egypt remittances are three times
the size of revenues from the Suez Canal.
In Tajikistan, remittances are 42 percent of GDP.
And in poorer countries, smaller 
countries, fragile countries,
conflict-afflicted countries, remittances are a lifeline,
as in Somalia or in Haiti.
No wonder these flows have huge
impacts on economies and on poor people.
Remittances, unlike private investment money,
they don't flow back at the first
sign of trouble in the country.
They actually act like an insurance.
When the family is in trouble,
facing hardship, facing hard times,
remittances increase, they act like an insurance.
Migrants send more money then.
Unlike development aid money,
that must go through official agencies,
through governments, remittances
directly reach the poor,
reach the family,
and often with business advice.
So in Nepal, the share of poor
people was 42 percent in 1995,
the share of poor people in the population.
By 2005, a decade later, at a
time of political crisis, economic crisis,
the share of poor people went down to 31 percent.
That decline in poverty, most of it,
about half of it, is believed to be
because of remittances from India,
another poor country.
In El Salvador, the school dropout
rate among children is lower
in families that receive remittances.
In Mexico and Sri Lanka,
the birth weight of children is higher
among families that receive remittances.
Remittances are dollars wrapped with care.
Migrants send money home for food,
for buying necessities, for building houses,
for funding education, for funding
healthcare for the elderly, for business
investments for friends and family.
Migrants send even more money home
for special occasions like a surgery
or a wedding. And migrants also send
money, perhaps far too many times,
for unexpected funerals that
they cannot attend.
Much as these flows do all that good,
there are barriers to these
flows of remittances, these
400 billion dollars of remittances.
Foremost among them is
the exorbitant cost of sending money home.
Money transfer companies structure
their fees to milk the poor.
They will say, "Up to 500 dollars
if you want to send, we will charge you
30 dollars fixed."
If you are poor and if you have 
only 200 dollars to send,
you have to pay that $30 fee.
The global average cost of sending
money is eight percent.
That means you send 100 dollars,
the family on the other side receives only
92 dollars.
To send money to Africa,
the cost is even higher:
12 percent.
To send money within Africa,
the cost is even higher:
over 20 percent.
For example, sending money from Benin 
to Nigeria.
And then there is the case of Venezuela, where,
because of exchange controls,
you send 100 dollars and you
are lucky if the family on the other side
receives even 10 dollars.
Of course, nobody sends money to Venezuela
through the official channel.
It all goes in suitcases.
Whereever costs are high,
money goes underground.
And what is worse,
many developing countries actually
have a blanket ban on sending money
out of the country.
Many rich nations also have a
blanket ban on sending money 
to specific countries.
So, is it that there are no options,
no better options, cheaper options, to send money?
There are.
M-Pesa in Kenya enables people to send money
and receive money at a fixed cost of only
60 cents per transaction.
U.S. Fed started a program with Mexico
to enable money service businesses
to send money to Mexico
for a fixed cost of only 67 cents per transaction.
And yet, these faster, cheaper, better options
can't be applied internationally
because of the fear of money laundering,
even though there is little data
to support any connection, any significant
connection between money laundering
and these small remittance transactions.
Many international banks now
are wary of hosting bank accounts
of money service businesses, especially
those serving Somalia.
Somalia, a country where the
per capita income is only 250 dollars per year.
Monthly remittances, on average, to Somalia
is larger than that amount.
Remittances are the lifeblood of Somalia.
And yet, this is an example of
the right hand giving a lot of aid,
while the left hand is cutting the lifeblood
to that economy, through regulations.
Then there is the case of poor people
from villages, like me.
In the villages, the only place where you can
get money is through the post office.
Most of the governments in the world
have allowed their post offices to have
exclusive partnerships with money transfer companies.
So, if I have to send money to my
father in the village, I must send money
through that particular money transfer company,
even if the cost is high.
I cannot go to a cheaper option.
This has to go.
So, what can international organizations and
social entrepreneurs do to reduce the cost
of sending money home?
First, relax regulations on small remittances
under 1,000 dollars.
Governments should recognize that
small remittances are not money laundering.
Second, governments should abolish exclusive partnerships
between their post office and the money 
transfer company.
For that matter, between the post office
and any national banking system that
has a large network that serves the poor.
In fact, they should promote competition,
open up the partnership so that
we will bring down costs like we did,
like they did, in the telecommunications industry.
You have seen what has happened there.
Third, large nonprofit philanthropic organizations
should create a remittance platform
on a nonprofit basis.
They should create a nonprofit
remittance platform to serve the money transfer
companies so that they can send money at a low cost,
while complying with all the complex
regulations all over the world.
The development community should
set a goal of reducing remittance costs
to one percent from the current eight percent.
If we reduce costs to one percent,
that would release a saving of 
30 billion dollars per year.
Thirty billion dollars, that's 
larger than the entire
bilateral aid budget going to Africa per year.
That is larger than, or almost similar to,
the total aid budget of the United States government,
the largest donor on the planet.
Actually, the savings would be larger
than that 30 billion because remittance channels
are also used for aid, trade and investment purposes.
Another major impediment to the
flow of remittances reaching the family
is the large and exorbitant
and illegal cost of recruitment,
fees that migrants pay, migrant workers
pay to laborers who found them the job.
I was in Dubai a few years ago.
I visited a camp for workers.
It was 8 in the evening, dark, hot, humid.
Workers were coming back from
their grueling day of work,
and I struck a conversation
with a Bangladeshi construction worker.
He was preoccupied that he is sending
money home, he has been
sending money home for a few months now,
and the money is mostly going
to the recruitment agent, to the labor agent
who found him that job.
And in my mind, I could picture
the wife waiting for
the monthly remittance.
The remittance arrives.
She takes the money and hands
it over to the recruitment agent,
while the children are looking on.
This has to stop.
It is not only construction 
workers from Bangladesh,
it is all the workers. There are millions of migrant
workers who suffer from this problem.
A construction worker from Bangladesh,
on an average, pays about 4,000 
dollars in recruitment fees
for a job that gives him only 2,000 
dollars per year in income.
That means that for the two years or three years
of his life, he is basically sending money
to pay for the recruitment fees.
The family doesn't get to see any of it.
It is not only Dubai, it is the dark
underbelly of every major city in the world.
It is not only Bangladeshi construction workers,
it is workers from all over the world.
It is not only men.
Women are especially vulnerable to
recruitment malpractices.
One of the most exciting and newest
thing happening in the area of remittances
is how to mobilize, through innovation,
diaspora saving and diaspora giving.
Migrants send money home,
but they also save a large amount of
money where they live.
Annually, migrant savings are estimated
to be 500 billion dollars.
Most of that money is parked in
bank deposits that give you zero percent interest rate.
If a country were to come 
and offer a three percent
or four percent interest rate, and then say
that the money would be used for building schools,
roads, airports, train systems
in the country of origin, a lot
of migrants would be interested in
parting with their money because
it's not only financial gains that
give them an opportunity
to stay engaged with their country's development.
Remittance channels can be used
to sell these bonds to migrants
because when they come
on a monthly basis to send remittances,
that's when you can actually sell
it to them.
You can also do the same
for mobilizing diaspora giving.
I would love to invest in a
bullet train system in India
and I would love to contribute to efforts
to fight malaria in my village.
Remittances are a great way of
sharing prosperity between places
in a targeted way that benefits
those who need them most.
Remittances empower people.
We must do all we can to make remittances
and recruitment
safer and cheaper.
And it can be done.
As for myself, I have been
away from India for two decades now.
My wife is a Venezuelan.
My children are Americans.
Increasingly, I feel like a global citizen.
And yet, I am growing nostalgic
about my country of birth.
I want to be in India and in the U.S. at the same time.
My parents are not there anymore.
My brothers and sisters have moved on.
There is no real urgency for me to send money home.
And yet, from time to time,
I send money home to friends,
to relatives, to the village,
to be there, to stay engaged —
that's part of my identity.
And, I'm still striving to be a poet
for the hardworking migrants
and their struggle to break free
of the cycle of poverty.
Thank you.
(Applause)
In India, we have these huge families.
I bet a lot of you all
must have heard about it.
Which means that there are
a lot of family events.
So as a child, my parents
used to drag me to these family events.
But the one thing
that I always looked forward to
was playing around with my cousins.
And there was always this one uncle
who used to be there,
always ready, jumping around with us,
having games for us,
making us kids have the time of our lives.
This man was extremely successful:
he was confident and powerful.
But then I saw this hale and hearty person
deteriorate in health.
He was diagnosed with Parkinson's.
Parkinson's is a disease that causes
degeneration of the nervous system,
which means that this person
who used to be independent
suddenly finds tasks like drinking coffee,
because of tremors, much more difficult.
My uncle started using a walker to walk,
and to take a turn,
he literally had to take
one step at a time, like this,
and it took forever.
So this person, who used to be
the center of attention
in every family gathering,
was suddenly hiding behind people.
He was hiding from the pitiful look
in people's eyes.
And he's not the only one in the world.
Every year, 60,000 people
are newly diagnosed with Parkinson's,
and this number is only rising.
As designers, we dream that our designs
solve these multifaceted problems,
one solution that solves it all,
but it need not always be like that.
You can also target simple problems
and create small solutions for them
and eventually make a big impact.
So my aim here was
to not cure Parkinson's,
but to make their everyday tasks
much more simple,
and then make an impact.
Well, the first thing I targeted
was tremors, right?
My uncle told me that he had stopped
drinking coffee or tea in public
just out of embarrassment,
so, well, I designed the no-spill cup.
It works just purely on its form.
The curve on top deflects the liquid
back inside every time they have tremors,
and this keeps the liquid inside
compared to a normal cup.
But the key here is that it is not tagged
as a Parkinson's patient product.
It looks like a cup that could be used
by you, me, any clumsy person,
and that makes it much more comforting
for them to use, to blend in.
So, well, one problem solved,
many more to go.
All this while, I was interviewing him,
questioning him,
and then I realized that I was getting
very superficial information,
or just answers to my questions.
But I really needed to dig deeper
to get a new perspective.
So I thought, well,
let's observe him in his daily tasks,
while he's eating, while he's watching TV.
And then, when I was actually
observing him walking to his dining table,
it struck me, this man who finds it
so difficult to walk on flat land,
how does he climb a staircase?
Because in India we do not have
a fancy rail that takes you up a staircase
like in the developed countries.
One actually has to climb the stairs.
So he told me,
"Well, let me show you how I do it."
Let's take a look at what I saw.
So he took really long
to reach this position,
and then all this while, I'm thinking,
"Oh my God, is he really going to do it?
Is he really, really going to do it
without his walker?"
And then ...
(Laughter)
And the turns, he took them so easily.
So -- shocked?
Well, I was too.
So this person who could not
walk on flat land
was suddenly a pro at climbing stairs.
On researching this, I realized that
it's because it's a continuous motion.
There's this other man
who also suffers from the same symptoms
and uses a walker,
but the moment he's put on a cycle,
all his symptoms vanish,
because it is a continuous motion.
So the key for me was to translate
this feeling of walking on a staircase
back to flat land.
And a lot of ideas
were tested and tried on him,
but the one that finally worked
was this one. Let's take a look.
(Laughter)
(Applause)
He walked faster, right?
(Applause)
I call this the staircase illusion,
and actually when the staircase illusion
abruptly ended, he froze,
and this is called freezing of gait.
So it happens a lot,
so why not have a staircase illusion
flowing through all their rooms,
making them feel much more confident?
You know, technology is not always it.
What we need are human-centered solutions.
I could have easily
made it into a projection,
or a Google Glass, or something like that.
But I stuck to simple print on the floor.
This print could be taken into hospitals
to make them feel much more welcome.
What I wish to do
is make every Parkinson's patient
feel like my uncle felt that day.
He told me that I made him feel
like his old self again.
"Smart" in today's world
has become synonymous to high tech,
and the world is only getting
smarter and smarter day by day.
But why can't smart be something
that's simple and yet effective?
All we need is a little bit of empathy
and some curiosity,
to go out there, observe.
But let's not stop at that.
Let's find these complex problems.
Don't be scared of them.
Break them, boil them down
into much smaller problems,
and then find simple solutions for them.
Test these solutions, fail if needed,
but with newer insights to make it better.
Imagine what we all could do
if we all came up with simple solutions.
What would the world be like
if we combined all our simple solutions?
Let's make a smarter world,
but with simplicity.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Last year ...
was hell.
(Laughter)
It was my first time eating
Nigerian "jollof."
(Laughter)
Actually, in all seriousness,
I was going through a lot
of personal turmoil.
Faced with enormous stress,
I suffered an anxiety attack.
On some days, I could do no work.
On other days,
I just wanted to lay in my bed and cry.
My doctor asked if I'd like to speak
with a mental health professional
about my stress and anxiety.
Mental health?
I clammed up and violently
shook my head in protest.
I felt a profound sense of a shame.
I felt the weight of stigma.
I have a loving, supportive family
and incredibly loyal friends,
yet I could not entertain
the idea of speaking to anyone
about my feeling of pain.
I felt suffocated
by the rigid architecture
of our African masculinity.
"People have real problems, Sangu.
Get over yourself!"
The first time I heard "mental health,"
I was a boarding school student
fresh off the boat from Ghana,
at the Peddie School in New Jersey.
I had just gone through
the brutal experience
of losing seven loved ones
in the same month.
The school nurse,
concerned about what I'd gone
through -- God bless her soul --
she inquired about my mental health.
"Is she mental?" I thought.
Does she not know I'm an African man?
(Laughter)
Like Okonkwo in "Things Fall Apart,"
we African men neither process
nor express our emotions.
We deal with our problems.
(Applause)
We deal with our problems.
I called my brother and laughed
about "Oyibo" people -- white people --
and their strange diseases --
depression, ADD and those "weird things."
Growing up in West Africa,
when people used the term "mental,"
what came to mind was a madman
with dirty, dread-locked hair,
bumbling around half-naked on the streets.
We all know this man.
Our parents warned us about him.
"Mommy, mommy, why is he mad?"
"Drugs!
If you even look at drugs,
you end up like him."
(Laughter)
Come down with pneumonia,
and your mother will rush you
to the nearest hospital
for medical treatment.
But dare to declare depression,
and your local pastor
will be driving out demons
and blaming witches in your village.
According to the World
Health Organization,
mental health is about being able to cope
with the normal stressors of life;
to work productively and fruitfully;
and to be able to make
a contribution to your community.
Mental health includes our emotional,
psychological and social well-being.
Globally, 75 percent
of all mental illness cases
can be found in low-income countries.
Yet most African governments
invest less than one percent
of their health care budget
in mental health.
Even worse,
we have a severe shortage
of psychiatrists in Africa.
Nigeria, for example,
is estimated to have 200 --
in a country of almost 200 million.
In all of Africa,
90 percent of our people
lack access to treatment.
As a result,
we suffer in solitude,
silenced by stigma.
We as Africans often respond
to mental health with distance,
ignorance,
guilt,
fear
and anger.
In a study conducted by Arboleda-Flórez,
directly asking, "What is the cause
of mental illness?"
34 percent of Nigerian respondents
cited drug misuse;
19 percent said divine wrath
and the will of God --
(Laughter)
12 percent,
witchcraft and spiritual possession.
But few cited other known
causes of mental illness,
like genetics,
socioeconomic status,
war,
conflict
or the loss of a loved one.
The stigmatization against mental illness
often results in the ostracizing
and demonizing of sufferers.
Photojournalist Robin Hammond
has documented some of these abuses ...
in Uganda,
in Somalia,
and here in Nigeria.
For me,
the stigma is personal.
In 2009,
I received a frantic call
in the middle of the night.
My best friend in the world --
a brilliant, philosophical,
charming, hip young man --
was diagnosed with schizophrenia.
I witnessed some of the friends
we'd grown up with recoil.
I heard the snickers.
I heard the whispers.
"Did you hear he has gone mad?"
(Kru English) "He has gone crazy!"
Derogatory, demeaning commentary
about his condition --
words we would never say
about someone with cancer
or someone with malaria.
Somehow, when it comes to mental illness,
our ignorance eviscerates all empathy.
I stood by his side
as his community isolated him,
but our love never wavered.
Tacitly, I became passionate
about mental health.
Inspired by his plight,
I helped found the mental health
special interest alumni group
at my college.
And during my tenure as a resident
tutor in graduate school,
I supported many undergraduates
with their mental health challenges.
I saw African students struggle
and unable to speak to anyone.
Even with this knowledge
and with their stories in tow,
I, in turn, struggled,
and could not speak to anyone
when I faced my own anxiety,
so deep is our fear of being the madman.
All of us --
but we Africans especially --
need to realize that our mental struggles
do not detract from our virility,
nor does our trauma taint our strength.
We need to see mental health
as important as physical health.
We need to stop suffering in silence.
We must stop stigmatizing disease
and traumatizing the afflicted.
Talk to your friends.
Talk to your loved ones.
Talk to health professionals.
Be vulnerable.
Do so with the confidence
that you are not alone.
Speak up if you're struggling.
Being honest about how we feel
does not make us weak;
it makes us human.
It is time to end the stigma
associated with mental illness.
So the next time your hear "mental,"
do not just think of the madman.
Think of me.
(Applause)
Thank you.
(Applause)
How often do we hear
that people just don't care?
How many times have you been told
that real, substantial change
isn't possible
because most people are too selfish,
too stupid or too lazy
to try to make a difference
in their community?
I propose to you today
that apathy as we think we know it
doesn't actually exist;
but rather, that people do care,
but that we live in a world
that actively discourages engagement
by constantly putting obstacles
and barriers in our way.
I'll give you some
examples of what I mean.
Let's start with city hall.
You ever see one of these before?
This is a newspaper ad.
It's a notice of a zoning application
change for a new office building
so the neighborhood
knows what's happening.
As you can see, it's impossible to read.
You need to get halfway down
to even find out which address
they're talking about,
and then further down,
in tiny 10-point font,
to find out how to actually get involved.
Imagine if the private sector
advertised in the same way --
if Nike wanted to sell a pair of shoes --
(Laughter)
And put an ad in the paper like that.
(Applause)
Now, that would never happen.
You'll never see an ad like that,
because Nike actually wants
you to buy their shoes,
whereas the city of Toronto
clearly doesn't want you involved
with the planning process,
otherwise their ads would look
something like this,
with all the information laid out clearly.
As long as the city's putting out
notices like this
to try to get people engaged,
then of course people
aren't going to be engaged.
But that's not apathy;
that's intentional exclusion.
Public space.
(Applause)
The manner in which we mistreat
our public spaces
is a huge obstacle towards any type
of progressive political change,
because we've essentially put a price tag
on freedom of expression.
Whoever has the most money
gets the loudest voice,
dominating the visual
and mental environment.
The problem with this model
is there are some amazing messages
that need to be said,
that aren't profitable to say.
So you're never going
to see them on a billboard.
The media plays an important role
in developing our relationship
with political change,
mainly by ignoring politics and focusing
on celebrities and scandals,
but even when they do talk
about important political issues,
they do it in a way that I feel
discourages engagement.
I'll give you an example.
The "Now" magazine from last week:
progressive, downtown weekly in Toronto.
This is the cover story.
It's an article
about a theater performance,
and it starts with basic
information about where it is,
in case you actually want to go and see
it after you've read the article --
where, the time, the website.
Same with this -- it's a movie review.
An art review.
A book review -- where the reading
is in case you want to go.
A restaurant -- you might not
want to just read about it,
maybe you want to go there.
So they tell you where it is, the prices,
the address, the phone number, etc.
Then you get to their political articles.
Here's a great article about an important
election race that's happening.
It talks about the candidates,
written very well,
but no information, no follow-up,
no websites for the campaigns,
no information about when the debates
are, where the campaign offices are.
Here's another good article,
about a new campaign
opposing privatization of transit,
without any contact information
for the campaign.
The message seems to be
that the readers are most likely
to want to eat, maybe read a book,
maybe see a movie, but not be engaged
in their community.
You might think this is a small thing,
but I think it's important,
because it sets a tone
and it reinforces the dangerous idea
that politics is a spectator sport.
Heroes: How do we view leadership?
Look at these 10 movies.
What do they have in common?
Anyone?
They all have heroes who were chosen.
Someone came up to them and said,
"You're the chosen one.
There's a prophecy.
You have to save the world."
And then they go off and save the world
because they've been told to,
with a few people tagging along.
This helps me understand
why a lot of people have trouble
seeing themselves as leaders --
because it sends all the wrong messages
about what leadership is about.
A heroic effort is a collective effort,
number one.
Number two, it's imperfect;
it's not very glamorous,
and doesn't suddenly start
and suddenly end.
It's an ongoing process your whole life.
But most importantly, it's voluntary.
It's voluntary.
As long as we're teaching our kids
that heroism starts when someone
scratches a mark on your forehead,
or someone tells you
you're part of a prophecy,
they're missing the most important
characteristic of leadership,
which is that it comes from within.
It's about following
your own dreams, uninvited,
and then working with others
to make those dreams come true.
Political parties: oh, boy.
Political parties could and should be
one of the basic entry points
for people to get engaged in politics.
Instead, they've become, sadly,
uninspiring and uncreative organizations
that rely so heavily on market research
and polling and focus groups
that they end up all saying
the same thing,
pretty much regurgitating back
to us what we already want to hear
at the expense of putting forward
bold and creative ideas.
And people can smell that,
and it feeds cynicism.
(Applause)
Charitable status.
Groups who have charitable status
in Canada aren't allowed to do advocacy.
This is a huge problem
and a huge obstacle to change,
because it means that some
of the most passionate and informed voices
are completely silenced,
especially during election time.
Which leads us to the last one,
which is: our elections.
As you may have noticed,
our elections in Canada
are a complete joke.
We use out-of-date systems
that are unfair and create random results.
Canada's currently led by a party
that most Canadians didn't actually want.
How can we honestly and genuinely
encourage more people to vote
when votes don't count in Canada?
You add all this up together,
and of course people are apathetic.
It's like trying to run into a brick wall.
Now, I'm not trying to be negative
by throwing all these obstacles out
and explaining what's in our way.
Quite the opposite --
I actually think people are amazing
and smart and that they do care,
but that, as I said,
we live in this environment
where all these obstacles
are being put in our way.
As long as we believe
that people, our own neighbors,
are selfish, stupid or lazy,
then there's no hope.
But we can change
all those things I mentioned.
We can open up city hall.
We can reform our electoral systems.
We can democratize our public spaces.
My main message is:
if we can redefine apathy,
not as some kind of internal syndrome,
but as a complex web of cultural barriers
that reinforces disengagement,
and if we can clearly define,
clearly identify what those obstacles are,
and then if we can work together
collectively to dismantle those obstacles,
then anything is possible.
Thank you.
(Applause)
It is almost the end of the winter,
and you've woken up to a cold house,
which is weird, because
you left the heater on all night.
You turn on the light.
It's not working.
Actually, the coffee maker, the TV --
none of them are working.
Life outside also seems to have stopped.
There are no schools,
most of the businesses are shut,
and there are no working trains.
This is not the opening scene
of a zombie apocalypse movie.
This is what happened in March 1989
in the Canadian province of Quebec,
when the power grid lost power.
The culprit?
A solar storm.
Solar storms are giant clouds of particles
escaping from the Sun from time to time,
and a constant reminder that we live
in the neighborhood of an active star.
And I, as a solar physicist,
I have a tremendous chance
to study these solar storms.
But you see, "solar storm chaser"
is not just a cool title.
My research helps to understand
where they come from,
how they behave
and, in the long run,
aims to mitigate their effects
on human societies,
which I'll get to in a second.
At the beginning of the space
exploration age 50 years ago only,
the probes we sent in space
revealed that the planets
in our Solar System
constantly bathe in a stream of particles
that are coming from the Sun
and that we call the solar wind.
And in the same way that global wind
patterns here on Earth
can be affected by hurricanes,
the solar wind is sometimes
affected by solar storms
that I like to call "space hurricanes."
When they arrive at planets,
they can perturb the space environment,
which in turn creates
the northern or southern lights,
for example, here on Earth,
but also Saturn
and also Jupiter.
Luckily, here on Earth,
we are protected
by our planet's natural shield,
a magnetic bubble that we call
the magnetosphere
and that you can see here
on the right side.
Nonetheless, solar storms
can still be responsible
for disrupting satellite
telecommunications and operations,
for disrupting navigation
systems, such as GPS,
as well as electric power transmission.
All of these are technologies
on which us humans rely more and more.
I mean, imagine if you woke up tomorrow
without a working cell phone --
no internet on it,
which means no social media.
I mean, to me that would be worse
than the zombie apocalypse.
(Laughter)
By constantly monitoring the Sun, though,
we now know where
the solar storms come from.
They come from regions of the Sun
where a tremendous amount
of energy is being stored.
You have an example here,
as a complex structure
hanging above the solar surface,
just on the verge of erupting.
Unfortunately, we cannot send probes
in the scorching hot
atmosphere of the Sun,
where temperatures can rise
up to around 10 million degrees Kelvin.
So what I do is I use computer simulations
in order to analyze but also to predict
the behavior of these storms
when they're just born at the Sun.
This is only one part
of the story, though.
When these solar storms
are moving in space,
some of them will inevitably
encounter space probes
that we humans have sent
in order to explore other worlds.
What I mean by other worlds is,
for example, planets,
such as Venus or Mercury,
but also objects, such as comets.
And while these space probes
have been made
for different scientific endeavors,
they can also act like tiny
cosmic meteorological stations
and monitor the evolution
of these space storms.
So I, with a group of researchers,
gather and analyze this data
coming from different
locations of the Solar System.
And by doing so, my research
shows that, actually,
solar storms have a generic shape,
and that this shape evolves
as solar storms move away from the Sun.
And you know what?
This is key for building tools
to predict space weather.
I would like to leave you
with this beautiful image.
This is us here on Earth,
this pale blue dot.
And while I study the Sun
and its storms every day,
I will always have a deep love
for this beautiful planet --
a pale blue dot indeed,
but a pale blue dot
with an invisible magnetic shield
that helps to protect us.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Hi, I'm Jack,
and I'm transgender.
Let me take a guess at some of thoughts
that might be running
through your head right now.
"Transgender?
Wait, does that mean that they're
actually a man or actually a woman?"
"I wonder if he's had the surgery yet ...
Oh, now I'm looking at his crotch.
Look to the right,
that's a safe place to look."
"Yes, I knew it!
No real man has hips like those."
"My friend's daughter is transgender --
I wonder if they know each other."
"Oh my gosh, he is so brave.
I would totally support his right
to use the men's bathroom.
Wait, but how does he use the bathroom?
How does he have sex?"
OK, OK, let's stop
those hypothetical questions
before we get too close for my comfort.
I mean, don't get me wrong,
I did come here today to share
my personal experiences being transgender,
but I did not wake up this morning
wanting to tell an entire audience
about my sex life.
Of course, that's the problem
with being trans, right?
People are pretty much always
wondering how we have sex
and what kind of equipment
we're working with below the belt.
Being trans is awkward.
And not just because the gender
I was assigned at birth
mismatches the one I really am.
Being trans is awkward
because everyone else gets awkward
when they're around me.
People who support me and all other
trans people wholeheartedly
are often so scared to say to wrong thing,
so embarrassed to not know
what they think they should,
that they never ask.
Part of what was so nerve-racking
about coming out as transgender
was knowing that people
wouldn't know what I meant.
And when someone comes out as gay,
people know what that means,
but when you come out as trans,
you have to face the misconceptions
that will color other people's
impressions of you
even after you've educated them ...
And you will have to educate them.
When I came out,
I wrote at 10-page encyclopedic document
with a zip-file attachment
of music and videos
that I sent to every
single person I came out to.
(Laughter)
And I kept it in my email signature
for months afterwards,
because you also
don't ever stop coming out.
I came out to the accountant
helping me with my taxes
and the TSA agents who didn't know
which one of them should pat me down,
the man or the woman.
I mean, I just came out
to everyone watching this.
When I came out to my dad,
to my great relief, he was totally cool
with me being trans,
but as soon as I started talking
about physically transitioning,
he freaked.
And I quickly realized it was because he,
like so many other people,
think that physical transition
means just one thing:
the surgery.
Now, listen,
if there were one magical surgery
that could turn me into a tall, muscular,
societally perfect image
of a man overnight,
I'd sign up in a heartbeat.
Unfortunately, it isn't that simple.
There are dozens of different
gender-affirming surgeries
from chest surgeries to bottom surgeries
to facial feminization and man-sculpting.
Many trans people will only ever undergo
one procedure in their lifetime, if that.
Maybe because they don't
personally feel the need
but also because they're expensive,
and health insurance
is only beginning to cover them.
Instead, the first step for a trans person
seeking physical transition
is usually hormone replacement therapy.
Hormones are why I have a deeper voice
and some sparse whiskers on my neck
and a giant pimple on my chin.
Basically, they put you
through a second puberty ...
it's a blast.
(Laughter)
Now, because our transitions
are slower and steadier
than historic misconceptions
can lead people to believe,
there can be some confusion
about when to call someone
by their new name and pronouns.
There's no distinct point
in physical transition
at which a trans person
becomes their true gender.
As soon as they tell you
their new name and pronouns,
that's when you start using them.
It can be difficult to make the change.
You might slip up here and there;
I've slipped up myself
with other trans people.
But I always think to myself,
if we can change from calling
Puff Daddy to P. Diddy,
and if we apologize profusely
when we've used the wrong gender pronoun
for someone's pet cat --
I mean, I think we can make
the same effort
for the real humans in our lives.
Now, there is no topic that makes other
people more awkward about trans people
than public bathrooms.
Ah, the bathrooms --
the latest political flash point
for LGBT opponents.
Here's a fun fact about bathrooms:
more US congressmen have been convicted
of assaulting someone in a public bathroom
than trans people have been.
(Laughter)
The truth is we trans people are so much
more scared of you than you are of us.
It's a huge point of discussion
in trans communities
about which bathroom
to start using and when,
so we don't attract attention
that could lead to violence against us.
I personally started using the men's room
when I started getting confused
and frightened looks in the women's room,
even though I was petrified
to start going into the men's room.
And often we opt to just
not go to the bathroom at all.
A 2015 national survey of trans people
found that eight percent of us
had had a urinary tract infection
in the past year
as a result of avoiding restrooms.
These bathroom bills
aren't protecting anyone.
All they're doing
is ensuring that when trans people
are assaulted in bathrooms,
the law will no longer be on our side
when we report it.
Being trans means a daily onslaught
of these misconceptions.
And I have it pretty easy.
I am a white, able-bodied guy
sitting nearly at the peak
of privilege mountain.
For non-binary people,
for trans women,
for trans people of color,
it is so much harder.
So I've given you a starter pack
of trans knowledge
that I hope will lead
to more learning on your own.
Talk to trans people.
Listen to us.
Amplify our voices.
Take the heat off of us
and educate those around you
so we don't have to every time.
Maybe someday, when I say,
"Hi, I'm Jack, and I'm transgender,"
the only response I'll get is,
"Hi, nice to meet you."
Thank you.
(Applause)
I used to think
the whole purpose of life
was pursuing happiness.
Everyone said the path
to happiness was success,
so I searched for that ideal job,
that perfect boyfriend,
that beautiful apartment.
But instead of ever feeling fulfilled,
I felt anxious and adrift.
And I wasn't alone; my friends --
they struggled with this, too.
Eventually, I decided to go
to graduate school for positive psychology
to learn what truly makes people happy.
But what I discovered there
changed my life.
The data showed that chasing happiness
can make people unhappy.
And what really struck me was this:
the suicide rate has been rising
around the world,
and it recently reached
a 30-year high in America.
Even though life is getting
objectively better
by nearly every conceivable standard,
more people feel hopeless,
depressed and alone.
There's an emptiness
gnawing away at people,
and you don't have to be
clinically depressed to feel it.
Sooner or later, I think we all wonder:
Is this all there is?
And according to the research,
what predicts this despair
is not a lack of happiness.
It's a lack of something else,
a lack of having meaning in life.
But that raised some questions for me.
Is there more to life than being happy?
And what's the difference
between being happy
and having meaning in life?
Many psychologists define happiness
as a state of comfort and ease,
feeling good in the moment.
Meaning, though, is deeper.
The renowned psychologist
Martin Seligman says
meaning comes from belonging to
and serving something beyond yourself
and from developing the best within you.
Our culture is obsessed with happiness,
but I came to see that seeking meaning
is the more fulfilling path.
And the studies show that people
who have meaning in life,
they're more resilient,
they do better in school and at work,
and they even live longer.
So this all made me wonder:
How can we each live more meaningfully?
To find out, I spent five years
interviewing hundreds of people
and reading through thousands
of pages of psychology,
neuroscience and philosophy.
Bringing it all together,
I found that there are what I call
four pillars of a meaningful life.
And we can each create lives of meaning
by building some or all
of these pillars in our lives.
The first pillar is belonging.
Belonging comes
from being in relationships
where you're valued
for who you are intrinsically
and where you value others as well.
But some groups and relationships
deliver a cheap form of belonging;
you're valued for what you believe,
for who you hate,
not for who you are.
True belonging springs from love.
It lives in moments among individuals,
and it's a choice -- you can choose
to cultivate belonging with others.
Here's an example.
Each morning, my friend Jonathan
buys a newspaper
from the same street vendor in New York.
They don't just conduct
a transaction, though.
They take a moment to slow down, talk,
and treat each other like humans.
But one time, Jonathan
didn't have the right change,
and the vendor said,
"Don't worry about it."
But Jonathan insisted on paying,
so he went to the store
and bought something he didn't need
to make change.
But when he gave the money to the vendor,
the vendor drew back.
He was hurt.
He was trying to do something kind,
but Jonathan had rejected him.
I think we all reject people in small ways
like this without realizing it.
I do.
I'll walk by someone I know
and barely acknowledge them.
I'll check my phone
when someone's talking to me.
These acts devalue others.
They make them feel
invisible and unworthy.
But when you lead with love,
you create a bond
that lifts each of you up.
For many people, belonging
is the most essential source of meaning,
those bonds to family and friends.
For others, the key to meaning
is the second pillar: purpose.
Now, finding your purpose
is not the same thing
as finding that job that makes you happy.
Purpose is less about what you want
than about what you give.
A hospital custodian told me
her purpose is healing sick people.
Many parents tell me,
"My purpose is raising my children."
The key to purpose
is using your strengths to serve others.
Of course, for many of us,
that happens through work.
That's how we contribute and feel needed.
But that also means
that issues like disengagement at work,
unemployment,
low labor force participation --
these aren't just economic problems,
they're existential ones, too.
Without something worthwhile to do,
people flounder.
Of course, you don't have to find
purpose at work,
but purpose gives you
something to live for,
some "why" that drives you forward.
The third pillar of meaning
is also about stepping beyond yourself,
but in a completely different way:
transcendence.
Transcendent states are those rare moments
when you're lifted above
the hustle and bustle of daily life,
your sense of self fades away,
and you feel connected
to a higher reality.
For one person I talked to,
transcendence came from seeing art.
For another person, it was at church.
For me, I'm a writer,
and it happens through writing.
Sometimes I get so in the zone
that I lose all sense of time and place.
These transcendent
experiences can change you.
One study had students look up
at 200-feet-tall eucalyptus trees
for one minute.
But afterwards
they felt less self-centered,
and they even behaved more generously
when given the chance to help someone.
Belonging, purpose, transcendence.
Now, the fourth pillar
of meaning, I've found,
tends to surprise people.
The fourth pillar is storytelling,
the story you tell yourself
about yourself.
Creating a narrative from the events
of your life brings clarity.
It helps you understand
how you became you.
But we don't always realize
that we're the authors of our stories
and can change the way we're telling them.
Your life isn't just a list of events.
You can edit, interpret
and retell your story,
even as you're constrained by the facts.
I met a young man named Emeka,
who'd been paralyzed playing football.
After his injury, Emeka told himself,
"My life was great playing football,
but now look at me."
People who tell stories like this --
"My life was good. Now it's bad." --
tend to be more anxious and depressed.
And that was Emeka for a while.
But with time, he started
to weave a different story.
His new story was,
"Before my injury,
my life was purposeless.
I partied a lot and was
a pretty selfish guy.
But my injury made me realize
I could be a better man."
That edit to his story
changed Emeka's life.
After telling the new story to himself,
Emeka started mentoring kids,
and he discovered what his purpose was:
serving others.
The psychologist Dan McAdams
calls this a "redemptive story,"
where the bad is redeemed by the good.
People leading meaningful
lives, he's found,
tend to tell stories about their lives
defined by redemption, growth and love.
But what makes people
change their stories?
Some people get help from a therapist,
but you can do it on your own, too,
just by reflecting
on your life thoughtfully,
how your defining experiences shaped you,
what you lost, what you gained.
That's what Emeka did.
You won't change your story overnight;
it could take years and be painful.
After all, we've all suffered,
and we all struggle.
But embracing those painful memories
can lead to new insights and wisdom,
to finding that good that sustains you.
Belonging, purpose,
transcendence, storytelling:
those are the four pillars of meaning.
When I was younger,
I was lucky enough to be surrounded
by all of the pillars.
My parents ran a Sufi meetinghouse
from our home in Montreal.
Sufism is a spiritual practice
associated with the whirling dervishes
and the poet Rumi.
Twice a week, Sufis would come to our home
to meditate, drink Persian tea,
and share stories.
Their practice also involved
serving all of creation
through small acts of love,
which meant being kind
even when people wronged you.
But it gave them a purpose:
to rein in the ego.
Eventually, I left home for college
and without the daily grounding
of Sufism in my life,
I felt unmoored.
And I started searching for those things
that make life worth living.
That's what set me on this journey.
Looking back, I now realize
that the Sufi house
had a real culture of meaning.
The pillars were part of the architecture,
and the presence of the pillars
helped us all live more deeply.
Of course, the same principle applies
in other strong communities as well --
good ones and bad ones.
Gangs, cults:
these are cultures of meaning
that use the pillars
and give people
something to live and die for.
But that's exactly why we as a society
must offer better alternatives.
We need to build these pillars
within our families and our institutions
to help people become their best selves.
But living a meaningful life takes work.
It's an ongoing process.
As each day goes by,
we're constantly creating our lives,
adding to our story.
And sometimes we can get off track.
Whenever that happens to me,
I remember a powerful experience
I had with my father.
Several months after
I graduated from college,
my dad had a massive heart attack
that should have killed him.
He survived, and when I asked him
what was going through his mind
as he faced death,
he said all he could think about
was needing to live
so he could be there
for my brother and me,
and this gave him the will
to fight for life.
When he went under anesthesia
for emergency surgery,
instead of counting backwards from 10,
he repeated our names like a mantra.
He wanted our names to be
the last words he spoke on earth
if he died.
My dad is a carpenter and a Sufi.
It's a humble life,
but a good life.
Lying there facing death,
he had a reason to live:
love.
His sense of belonging within his family,
his purpose as a dad,
his transcendent meditation,
repeating our names --
these, he says, are the reasons
why he survived.
That's the story he tells himself.
That's the power of meaning.
Happiness comes and goes.
But when life is really good
and when things are really bad,
having meaning gives you
something to hold on to.
Thank you.
(Applause)
I come from a family of five brothers,
all scientists and engineers.
A few years ago,
I sent them the following email:
"Dear brothers, I hope
this message finds you well.
I am emailing to let you know
that I'm dropping out
of my master's program in engineering
to pursue a career
as a full-time musician.
All that I ask from you
is not to worry about me."
Brother number one replied.
He was encouraging but a bit skeptical.
He said, "I wish you the best of luck.
You're going to need it."
(Laughter)
Brother number two
was a little bit more skeptical.
He said, "Don't do it!
This will be the worst
mistake of your life.
Find a real career."
(Laughter)
Well, the rest of my brothers
were so enthusiastic about my decision,
they didn't even respond.
(Laughter)
I know that the skepticism
coming from my brothers
is out of care and concern for me.
They were worried.
They thought it would be difficult
to make it as an artist,
that it will be a challenge.
And you know what? They were right.
It is such a challenge
to be a full-time artist.
I have so many friends
who need to have a second job
as a plan B in order to pay for the bills,
except that plan B
sometimes becomes their plan A.
And it's not just my friends and I
who experience this.
The US Census Bureau states that only
10 percent of art school graduates
end up working as full-time artists.
The other 90 percent, they change careers,
they work in marketing,
sales, education and other fields.
But this is not news, right?
We almost expect the artist
to be a struggling artist.
But why should we expect that?
I read an article in the "Huffington Post"
saying that four years ago,
the European Union
began the world's largest ever
arts funding initiative.
Creative Europe
will give 2.4 billion dollars
to over 300,000 artists.
In contrast, the US budget
for our National Endowment for the Arts,
the largest single funder
for the arts across the United States,
is merely 146 million dollars.
To put things into perspective,
the US budget for the military
marching bands alone
is almost twice as much as the entire NEA.
Another striking image comes from
Brendan McMahon for the "Huffington Post,"
saying that out of
the one trillion dollar budget
for military and defense-related spending,
if only 0.05 percent
were allocated to the arts,
we would be able to pay
for 20 full-time symphony orchestras
at 20 million dollars apiece,
and give over 80,000 artists
an annual salary of 50,000 dollars each.
If that's only 0.05 percent,
imagine what a full one percent could do.
Now, I know we live
in a capitalist society,
and profits matter a lot.
So let's look at it
from a financial angle, shall we?
The US nonprofit arts industry
generates more than 166 billion dollars
in economic activity,
it employs 5.7 million people
and it returns 12.6 billion dollars
in tax revenue.
But this is only a financial angle, right?
We all know that the arts is way more
than just an economic value.
The arts brings meaning to life.
It's the spirit of our culture.
It brings people together
and it supports creativity
and social cohesion.
But if the arts contributes
this much to our economy,
why then do we still invest
so little in arts and artists?
Why do more than 80 percent
of our schools nationwide
still experience budget cuts
in arts education programs?
What is it about the value
of arts and artists
that we still don't understand?
I believe the system is flawed
and far from being fair,
and I want to help change that.
I want to live in a society
where artists are more valued
and have more cultural
and financial support
so they can focus on creating arts
instead of being forced to drive Ubers
or take corporate jobs
they'd rather not have.
There are other sources of income
for artists, however.
There are private foundations,
grants and patrons who give money,
except a vast majority of artists
don't know about these opportunities.
On one side you have institutions
and people with money.
On the other side
you have artists seeking funding,
but the artists don't know
about the people with the money,
and the people with the money
don't necessarily know
about the artists out there.
This is why I am very excited
to share "Grantpa,"
an online platform that uses technology
to match artists with grants
and funding opportunities
in a way that is easy, fast
and less intimidating.
Grantpa is only one step
towards solving an existing problem
of funding inequality,
but we need to work collectively
on multiple fronts
to reevaluate how we view
the artists in our society.
Do we think of arts
as a luxury or a necessity?
Do we understand what goes on
in the day-to-day life of an artist,
or do we still believe that artists,
no matter how struggling they are,
are happy simply because
they're following their passion?
In a few years, I plan to send
my brothers the following email:
"Dear brothers, I hope
this message finds you well.
I am emailing to let you know
that I am doing great
and so are hundreds
of thousands of artists
who are being valued more
culturally and financially
and getting enough funding
to focus on their crafts
and create more art.
I appreciate all of your support.
Couldn't have done it without you."
Thank you.
(Applause)
Hi, my name is Marcin --
farmer, technologist.
I was born in Poland, now in the U.S.
I started a group called Open Source Ecology.
We've identified the 50 most important machines
that we think it takes for modern life to exist --
things from tractors,
bread ovens, circuit makers.
Then we set out to create
an open source, DIY, do it yourself version
that anyone can build and maintain
at a fraction of the cost.
We call this the Global Village Construction Set.
So let me tell you a story.
So I finished my 20s
with a Ph.D. in fusion energy,
and I discovered I was useless.
I had no practical skills.
The world presented me with options,
and I took them.
I guess you can call it the consumer lifestyle.
So I started a farm in Missouri
and learned about the economics of farming.
I bought a tractor -- then it broke.
I paid to get it repaired --
then it broke again.
Then pretty soon,
I was broke too.
I realized
that the truly appropriate, low-cost tools that I needed
to start a sustainable farm and settlement
just didn't exist yet.
I needed tools that were robust, modular,
highly efficient and optimized,
low-cost,
made from local and recycled materials that would last a lifetime,
not designed for obsolescence.
I found that I would have to build them myself.
So I did just that.
And I tested them.
And I found that industrial productivity
can be achieved on a small scale.
So then I published the 3D designs,
schematics,
instructional videos and budgets
on a wiki.
Then contributors from all over the world
began showing up, prototyping new machines
during dedicated project visits.
So far, we have prototyped eight of the 50 machines.
And now the project
is beginning to grow on its own.
We know that open source has succeeded
with tools for managing knowledge and creativity.
And the same is starting to happen with hardware too.
We're focusing on hardware
because it is hardware that can change people's lives
in such tangible material ways.
If we can lower the barriers to farming, building, manufacturing,
then we can unleash just massive amounts of human potential.
That's not only in the developing world.
Our tools are being made
for the American farmer, builder, entrepreneur, maker.
We've seen lots of excitement from these people,
who can now start a construction business,
parts manufacturing,
organic CSA
or just selling power back to the grid.
Our goal is a repository of published designs
so clear, so complete,
that a single burned DVD
is effectively a civilization starter kit.
I've planted a hundred trees in a day.
I've pressed 5,000 bricks in one day
from the dirt beneath my feet
and built a tractor in six days.
From what I've seen, this is only the beginning.
If this idea is truly sound,
then the implications are significant.
A greater distribution of the means of production,
environmentally sound supply chains,
and a newly relevant DIY maker culture
can hope to transcend
artificial scarcity.
We're exploring the limits
of what we all can do to make a better world
with open hardware technology.
Thank you.
(Applause)
She wrote:
"When I become famous,
I will tell everyone
that I know a hero named Marlon Peterson."
Heroes rarely look like me.
In fact,
I'm what garbage looks like.
No, not the most appealing
way to open a talk
or start a conversation,
and perhaps you have some questions
going through your head about that.
Why would this man say
such a thing about himself?
What does he mean?
How can someone view him as a hero
when he sees himself as garbage?
I believe we learn more from questions
than we do from answers.
Because when we're questioning something,
we're invested in taking in
some sort of new information,
or grappling with some sort of ignorance
that makes us feel uncomfortable.
And that's why I'm here:
to push us to question,
even when it makes us uncomfortable.
My parents are from Trinidad and Tobago,
the southernmost island in the Caribbean.
Trinidad is also home
to the only acoustic instrument
invented in the 20th century:
the steel pan.
Deriving from the African drums
and evolving from the genius
of one of the ghettos in Trinidad,
a city called Laventille,
and the disregard
of the American military ...
Well, I should tell you,
America, during WWII, had
military bases set up in Trinidad,
and when the war ended,
they left the island littered
with empty oil drums --
their trash.
So people from Laventille
repurposed the old drums left behind
into the full chromatic scale:
the steel pan.
Playing music now from Beethoven
to Bob Marley to 50 Cent,
those people literally made
music out of garbage.
Twelve days before my 20th birthday,
I was arrested for my role
in a violent robbery attempt
in lower Manhattan.
While people were sitting
in a coffee shop,
four people were shot.
Two were killed.
Five of us were arrested.
We were all the products
of Trinidad and Tobago.
We were the "bad immigrants,"
or the "anchor babies" that Trump
and millions of Americans easily malign.
I was discarded, like waste material --
and justifiably so to many.
I eventually served 10 years, two months
and seven days of a prison sentence.
I was sentenced to a decade of punishment
in a correctional institution.
I was sentenced to irrelevance --
the opposite of humanity.
Interestingly,
it was during those years in prison
that a series of letters redeemed me,
helped me move beyond
the darkness and the guilt
associated with the worst
moment of my young life.
It gave me a sense that I was useful.
She was 13 years old.
She had wrote that she saw me as a hero.
I remember reading that,
and I remember crying
when I read those words.
She was one of over 50 students
and 150 letters that I wrote during
a mentoring correspondence program
that I co-designed with a friend
who was a teacher
at a middle school in Brooklyn,
my hometown.
We called it the Young Scholars Program.
Every time those young people
shared their stories with me,
their struggles,
every time they drew a picture
of their favorite cartoon character
and sent it to me,
every time they said they depended
on my letters or my words of advice,
it boosted my sense of worthiness.
It gave me a sense of what
I could contribute to this planet.
It transformed my life.
Because of those letters
and what they shared with me,
their stories of teen life,
they gave me the permission,
they gave me the courage
to admit to myself
that there were reasons -- not excuses --
but that there were reasons
for that fateful day in October of 1999;
that the trauma associated
with living in a community
where guns are easier
to get than sneakers;
that the trauma associated with being
raped at gunpoint at the age of 14;
that those are reasons for me
why making that decision,
that fatal decision,
was not an unlikely proposition.
Because those letters
mattered so much to me,
because writing and receiving
and having that communication
with those folks
so hugely impacted my life,
I decided to share the opportunity
with some friends of mine
who were also inside with me.
My friends Bill and Cory and Arocks,
all in prison for violent crimes also,
shared their words of wisdom
with the young people as well,
and received the sense
of relevancy in return.
We are now published writers
and youth program innovators
and trauma experts
and gun violence prevention advocates,
and TED talkers and --
(Laughter)
and good daddies.
That's what I call a positive
return of investment.
Above all else,
what building that program
taught me was that when we sow,
when we invest in the humanity
of people no matter where they're at,
we can reap amazing rewards.
In this latest era
of criminal justice reform,
I often question and wonder why --
why is it that so many believe
that only those who have been convicted
of nonviolent drug offenses
merit empathy and recognized humanity?
Criminal justice reform is human justice.
Am I not human?
When we invest in resources
that amplify the relevancy of people
in communities like Laventille
or parts of Brooklyn or a ghetto near you,
we can literally create
the communities that we want.
We can do better.
We can do better than investing solely
in law enforcement as a resource,
because they don't give us
a sense of relevancy
that is at the core of why so many of us
do so many harmful things
in the pursuit of mattering.
See, gun violence is just a visible
display of a lot of underlying traumas.
When we invest in the redemptive
value of relevancy,
we can render a return of both
personal responsibility and healing.
That's the people work I care about,
because people work.
Family, I'm asking you
to do the hard work,
the difficult work,
the churning work of bestowing
undeserved kindness
upon those who we can relegate as garbage,
who we can disregard and discard easily.
I'm asking myself.
Over the past two months,
I've lost two friends to gun violence,
both innocent bystanders.
One was caught in a drive-by
while walking home.
The other was sitting in a café
while eating breakfast,
while on vacation in Miami.
I'm asking myself to see
the redemptive value of relevancy
in the people that murdered them,
because of the hard work
of seeing the value in me.
I'm pushing us to challenge
our own capacity
to fully experience our humanity,
by understanding the full biography
of people who we can
easily choose not to see,
because heroes are waiting
to be recognized,
and music is waiting to be made.
Thank you.
(Applause)
The story I wanted to share with you today
is my challenge as an Iranian artist,
as an Iranian woman artist,
as an Iranian woman artist
living in exile.
Well, it has its pluses and minuses.
On the dark side,
politics doesn't seem to escape people like me.
Every Iranian artist, in one form or another,
is political.
Politics have defined our lives.
If you're living in Iran,
you're facing censorship, harassment,
arrest, torture --
at times, execution.
If you're living outside like me,
you're faced with life in exile --
the pain of the longing
and the separation from your loved ones
and your family.
Therefore, we don't find
the moral, emotional,
psychological and political space
to distance ourselves from the reality
of social responsibility.
Oddly enough,
an artist such as myself
finds herself also in the position of being the voice,
the speaker of my people,
even if I have, indeed,
no access to my own country.
Also, people like myself,
we're fighting two battles on different grounds.
We're being critical of the West,
the perception of the West
about our identity --
about the image that is constructed about us,
about our women, about our politics,
about our religion.
We are there to take pride
and insist on respect.
And at the same time,
we're fighting another battle.
That is our regime,
our government --
our atrocious government,
[that] has done every crime
in order to stay in power.
Our artists are at risk.
We are in a position of danger.
We pose a threat
to the order of the government.
But ironically,
this situation
has empowered all of us,
because we are considered, as artists,
central to the cultural, political,
social discourse in Iran.
We are there to inspire, to provoke,
to mobilize,
to bring hope to our people.
We are the reporters of our people,
and are communicators
to the outside world.
Art is our weapon.
Culture is a form of resistance.
I envy sometimes the artists of the West
for their freedom of expression.
For the fact that they can distance themselves
from the question of politics.
From the fact that they are only serving one audience,
mainly the Western culture.
But also, I worry about the West,
because often in this country,
in this Western world that we have,
culture risks being a form of entertainment.
Our people depend on our artists,
and culture is beyond communication.
My journey as an artist
started from a very, very personal place.
I did not start
to make social commentary
about my country.
The first one that you see in front of you
is actually when I first returned to Iran
after being separated for a good 12 years.
It was after the Islamic Revolution
of 1979.
While I was absent from Iran,
the Islamic Revolution had descended on Iran
and had entirely transformed the country
from Persian to the Islamic culture.
I came mainly to be reunited with my family
and to reconnect in a way
that I found my place in the society.
But instead, I found a country
that was totally ideological
and that I didn't recognize anymore.
More so, I became very interested,
as I was facing
my own personal dilemmas and questions,
I became immersed in the study
of the Islamic Revolution --
how, indeed,
it had incredibly transformed
the lives of Iranian women.
I found the subject of Iranian women
immensely interesting,
in the way the women of Iran, historically,
seemed to embody the political transformation.
So in a way, by studying a woman,
you can read the structure and the ideology of the country.
So I made a group of work
that at once faced my own personal questions in life,
and yet it brought my work into a larger discourse --
the subject of martyrdom,
the question of those who willingly stand in that intersection
of love of God, faith,
but violence and crime and cruelty.
For me, this became incredibly important.
And yet, I had an unusual position toward this.
I was an outsider
who had come back to Iran to find my place,
but I was not in a position
to be critical of the government
or the ideology of the Islamic Revolution.
This changed slowly
as I found my voice
and I discovered things
that I didn't know I would discover.
So my art became slightly more critical.
My knife became a little sharper.
And I fell into a life in exile.
I am a nomadic artist.
I work in Morocco, in Turkey, in Mexico.
I go everywhere to make believe it's Iran.
Now I am making films.
Last year, I finished a film
called "Women Without Men."
"Women Without Men" returns to history,
but another part of our Iranian history.
It goes to 1953
when American CIA exercised a coup
and removed a democratically elected leader,
Dr. Mossadegh.
The book is written by an Iranian woman,
Shahrnush Parsipur.
It's a magical realist novel.
This book is banned,
and she spent five years in prison.
My obsession with this book,
and the reason I made this into a film,
is because it at once was addressing
the question of being a female --
traditionally, historically in Iran --
and the question of four women
who are all looking for an idea
of change, freedom and democracy --
while the country of Iran, equally, as if another character,
also struggled for an idea
of freedom and democracy
and independence from the foreign interventions.
I made this film
because I felt it's important
for it to speak to the Westerners
about our history as a country.
That all of you seem to remember Iran
after the Islamic Revolution.
That Iran was once a secular society,
and we had democracy,
and this democracy was stolen from us
by the American government,
by the British government.
This film also speaks to the Iranian people
in asking them to return to their history
and look at themselves before they were so Islamicized --
in the way we looked, in the way we played music,
in the way we had intellectual life.
And most of all,
in the way that we fought for democracy.
These are some of the shots actually from my film.
These are some of the images of the coup.
And we made this film in Casablanca,
recreating all the shots.
This film tried to find a balance
between telling a political story,
but also a feminine story.
Being a visual artist, indeed,
I am foremost interested to make art --
to make art that transcends
politics, religion,
the question of feminism,
and become an important, timeless,
universal work of art.
The challenge I have
is how to do that.
How to tell a political story but an allegorical story.
How to move you with your emotions,
but also make your mind work.
These are some of the images
and the characters of the film.
Now comes the green movement --
the summer of 2009,
as my film is released --
the uprising begins in the streets of Tehran.
What is unbelievably ironic
is the period that we tried to depict in the film,
the cry for democracy
and social justice,
repeats itself now
again in Tehran.
The green movement
significantly inspired the world.
It brought a lot of attention to all those Iranians
who stand for basic human rights
and struggle for democracy.
What was most significant for me
was, once again,
the presence of the women.
They're absolutely inspirational for me.
If in the Islamic Revolution,
the images of the woman portrayed
were submissive
and didn't have a voice,
now we saw a new idea of feminism
in the streets of Tehran --
women who were educated,
forward thinking, non-traditional,
sexually open, fearless
and seriously feminist.
These women and those young men
united Iranians
across the world, inside and outside.
I then discovered
why I take so much inspiration
from Iranian women.
That, under all circumstances,
they have pushed the boundary.
They have confronted the authority.
They have broken every rule
in the smallest and the biggest way.
And once again, they proved themselves.
I stand here to say
that Iranian women have found a new voice,
and their voice is giving me my voice.
And it's a great honor
to be an Iranian woman and an Iranian artist,
even if I have to operate in the West only for now.
Thank you so much.
(Applause)
I want to tell you a story about a girl.
But I can't tell you her real name.
So let's just call her Hadiza.
Hadiza is 20.
She's shy,
but she has a beautiful smile
that lights up her face.
But she's in constant pain.
And she will likely be on medication
for the rest of her life.
Do you want to know why?
Hadiza is a Chibok girl,
and on April 14, 2014, she was kidnapped
by Boko Haram terrorists.
She managed to escape, though,
by jumping off the truck
that was carrying the girls.
But when she landed,
she broke both her legs,
and she had to crawl on her tummy
to hide in the bushes.
She told me she was terrified
that Boko Haram would come back for her.
She was one of 57 girls who would escape
by jumping off trucks that day.
This story, quite rightly, caused ripples
around the world.
People like Michelle Obama,
Malala and others
lent their voices in protest,
and at about the same time --
I was living in London at the time --
I was sent from London to Abuja
to cover the World Economic Forum
that Nigeria was hosting
for the first time.
But when we arrived, it was clear
that there was only one story in town.
We put the government under pressure.
We asked tough questions
about what they were doing
to bring these girls back.
Understandably,
they weren't too happy
with our line of questioning,
and let's just say we received
our fair share of "alternative facts."
(Laughter)
Influential Nigerians
were telling us at the time
that we were naïve,
we didn't understand
the political situation in Nigeria.
But they also told us
that the story of the Chibok girls
was a hoax.
Sadly, this hoax narrative has persisted,
and there are still people
in Nigeria today
who believe that the Chibok girls
were never kidnapped.
Yet I was talking to people like these --
devastated parents,
who told us that on the day
Boko Haram kidnapped their daughters,
they ran into the Sambisa Forest
after the trucks carrying their daughters.
They were armed with machetes,
but they were forced to turn back
because Boko Haram had guns.
For two years, inevitably,
the news agenda moved on,
and for two years,
we didn't hear much
about the Chibok girls.
Everyone presumed they were dead.
But in April last year,
I was able to obtain this video.
This is a still from the video
that Boko Haram filmed as a proof of life,
and through a source,
I obtained this video.
But before I could publish it,
I had to travel
to the northeast of Nigeria
to talk to the parents, to verify it.
I didn't have to wait
too long for confirmation.
One of the mothers,
when she watched the video, told me
that if she could have reached
into the laptop
and pulled our her child from the laptop,
she would have done so.
For those of you who are parents,
like myself, in the audience,
you can only imagine the anguish
that that mother felt.
This video would go on to kick-start
negotiation talks with Boko Haram.
And a Nigerian senator told me
that because of this video
they entered into those talks,
because they had long presumed
that the Chibok girls were dead.
Twenty-one girls were freed
in October last year.
Sadly, nearly 200 of them
still remain missing.
I must confess that I have not been
a dispassionate observer
covering this story.
I am furious when I think
about the wasted opportunities
to rescue these girls.
I am furious when I think about
what the parents have told me,
that if these were daughters
of the rich and the powerful,
they would have been found much earlier.
And I am furious
that the hoax narrative,
I firmly believe,
caused a delay;
it was part of the reason
for the delay in their return.
This illustrates to me
the deadly danger of fake news.
So what can we do about it?
There are some very smart people,
smart engineers at Google and Facebook,
who are trying to use technology
to stop the spread of fake news.
But beyond that, I think
everybody here -- you and I --
we have a role to play in that.
We are the ones who share the content.
We are the ones who share
the stories online.
In this day and age, we're all publishers,
and we have responsibility.
In my job as a journalist,
I check, I verify.
I trust my gut, but I ask tough questions.
Why is this person telling me this story?
What do they have to gain
by sharing this information?
Do they have a hidden agenda?
I really believe that we must all start
to ask tougher questions
of information that we discover online.
Research shows that some of us
don't even read beyond headlines
before we share stories.
Who here has done that?
I know I have.
But what if
we stopped taking information
that we discover at face value?
What if we stop to think
about the consequence
of the information that we pass on
and its potential to incite
violence or hatred?
What if we stop to think
about the real-life consequences
of the information that we share?
Thank you very much for listening.
(Applause)
Recently, we've seen the effects
of cyber attacks on the business world.
Data breaches at companies like JP Morgan,
Yahoo, Home Depot and Target
have caused losses of hundreds of millions
and in some cases, billions of dollars.
It wouldn't take many large attacks
to ravage the world economy.
And the public sector
has not been immune, either.
In 2012 to 2014,
there was a significant data breach
at the US Office of Personnel Management.
Security clearance
and fingerprint data was compromised,
affecting 22 million employees.
And you may have heard of the attempt
by state-sponsored hackers
to use stolen data to influence election
outcomes in a number of countries.
Two recent examples are
the compromise of a large amount of data
from the Bundestag,
the national Parliament of Germany,
and the theft of emails from the US
Democratic National Committee.
The cyber threat is now affecting
our democratic processes.
And it's likely to get worse.
As computer technology
is becoming more powerful,
the systems we use to protect our data
are becoming more vulnerable.
Adding to the concern
is a new type of computing technology,
called quantum computing,
which leverages microscopic
properties of nature
to deliver unimaginable increases
in computational power.
It's so powerful that it will crack
many of the encryption systems
that we use today.
So is the situation hopeless?
Should we start packing
our digital survival gear
and prepare for an upcoming
data apocalypse?
I would say, not yet.
Quantum computing is still in the labs,
and it will take a few years
until it's put to practical applications.
More important,
there have been major breakthroughs
in the field of encryption.
For me, this is
a particularly exciting time
in the history of secure communications.
About 15 years ago,
when I learned of our new-found ability
to create quantum effects
that don't exist in nature,
I was excited.
The idea of applying
the fundamental laws of physics
to make encryption stronger
really intrigued me.
Today, a select groups of companies
and labs around the world, including mine,
are maturing this technology
for practical applications.
That's right.
We are now preparing
to fight quantum with quantum.
So how does this all work?
Well, first, let's take a quick tour
of the world of encryption.
For that, you'll need a briefcase,
some important documents that you want
to send your friend, James Bond,
and a lock to keep it all safe.
Because the documents are top secret,
we're going to use an advanced briefcase.
It has a special combination lock
which, when closed,
converts all the text
in the documents to random numbers.
So you put your documents inside,
close the lock --
at which point in time the documents
get converted to random numbers --
and you send the briefcase to James.
While it's on its way,
you call him to give him the code.
When he gets the briefcase,
he enters the code,
the documents get unscrambled, and voilà,
you've just sent
an encoded message to James Bond.
(Laughter)
A fun example, but it does illustrate
three things important for encryption.
The code -- we call this
an encryption key.
You can think of it as a password.
The call to James to give him
the code for the combination lock.
We call this key exchange.
This is how you ensure
you get the encryption key
securely to the right place.
And the lock, which encodes
and decodes the document.
We call this an encryption algorithm.
Using the key, it encodes
the text in the documents
to random numbers.
A good algorithm will encode in such a way
that without the key
it's very difficult to unscramble.
What makes encryption so important
is that if someone were to capture
the briefcase and cut it open
without the encryption key
and the encryption algorithm,
they wouldn't be able
to read the documents.
They would look like nothing more
than a bunch of random numbers.
Most security systems rely
on a secure method for key exchange
to communicate the encryption key
to the right place.
However, rapid increases
in computational power
are putting at risk a number
of the key exchange methods we have today.
Consider one of the very
widely used systems today -- RSA.
When it was invented, in 1977,
it was estimated that it would take
40 quadrillion years
to break a 426-bit RSA key.
In 1994, just 17 years later,
the code was broken.
As computers have become
more and more powerful,
we've had to use larger and larger codes.
Today we routinely use 2048 or 4096 bits.
As you can see, code makers and breakers
are engaged in an ongoing battle
to outwit each other.
And when quantum computers arrive
in the next 10 to 15 years,
they will even more rapidly
crack the complex mathematics
that underlies many
of our encryption systems today.
Indeed, the quantum computer is likely
to turn our present security castle
into a mere house of cards.
We have to find a way
to defend our castle.
There's been a growing
body of research in recent years
looking at using quantum effects
to make encryption stronger.
And there have been
some exciting breakthroughs.
Remember those three things
important for encryption --
high-quality keys, secure key exchange
and a strong algorithm?
Well, advances in science and engineering
are putting two of those
three elements at risk.
First of all, those keys.
Random numbers are the foundational
building blocks of encryption keys.
But today, they're not truly random.
Currently, we construct encryption keys
from sequences of random numbers
generated from software,
so-called pseudo-random numbers.
Numbers generated by a program
or a mathematical recipe
will have some, perhaps subtle,
pattern to them.
The less random the numbers are,
or in scientific terms,
the less entropy they contain,
the easier they are to predict.
Recently, several casinos
have been victims of a creative attack.
The output of slot machines
was recorded over a period of time
and then analyzed.
This allowed the cyber criminals
to reverse engineer
the pseudo-random number generator
behind the spinning wheels.
And allowed them, with high accuracy,
to predict the spins of the wheels,
enabling them to make big financial gains.
Similar risks apply to encryption keys.
So having a true random number generator
is essential for secure encryption.
For years, researchers have been looking
at building true random number generators.
But most designs to date
are either not random enough,
fast enough or aren't easily repeatable.
But the quantum world is truly random.
So it makes sense to take advantage
of this intrinsic randomness.
Devices that can measure quantum effects
can produce an endless stream
of random numbers at high speed.
Foiling all those
would-be casino criminals.
A select group of universities
and companies around the world
are focused on building
true random number generators.
At my company, our quantum
random number generator
started life on a two meter
by one meter optic table.
We were then able to reduce it
to a server-size box.
Today, it's miniaturized into a PCI card
that plugs into a standard computer.
This is the world's fastest
true random number generator.
It measures quantum effects to produce
a billion random numbers per second.
And it's in use today to improve security
at cloud providers, banks
and government agencies
around the world.
(Applause)
But even with a true
random number generator,
we've still got the second
big cyber threat:
the problem of secure key exchange.
Current key exchange techniques
will not stand up to a quantum computer.
The quantum solution to this problem
is called quantum key distribution or QKD,
which leverages a fundamental,
counterintuitive characteristic
of quantum mechanics.
The very act of looking
at a quantum particle changes it.
Let me give you an example
of how this works.
Consider again exchanging the code
for the lock with James Bond.
Except this time, instead of a call
to give James the code,
we're going to use quantum effects
on a laser to carry the code
and send it over standard
optic fiber to James.
We assume that Dr. No
is trying to hack the exchange.
Luckily, Dr. No's attempt to intercept
the quantum keys while in transit
will leave fingerprints
that James and you can detect.
This allows those intercepted keys
to be discarded.
The keys which are then retained
can be used to provide
very strong data protection.
And because the security is based
on the fundamental laws of physics,
a quantum computer, or indeed
any future supercomputer
will not be able to break it.
My team and I are collaborating
with leading universities
and the defense sector
to mature this exciting technology
into the next generation
of security products.
The internet of things
is heralding a hyperconnected era
with 25 to 30 billion
connected devices forecast by 2020.
For the correct functioning
of our society in an IoT world,
trust in the systems that support
these connected devices is vital.
We're betting that quantum technologies
will be essential in providing this trust,
enabling us to fully benefit
from the amazing innovations
that are going to so enrich our lives.
Thank you.
(Applause)
This is a photograph
by the artist Michael Najjar,
and it's real,
in the sense that he went there to Argentina
to take the photo.
But it's also a fiction. There's a lot of work that went into it after that.
And what he's done
is he's actually reshaped, digitally,
all of the contours of the mountains
to follow the vicissitudes of the Dow Jones index.
So what you see,
that precipice, that high precipice with the valley,
is the 2008 financial crisis.
The photo was made
when we were deep in the valley over there.
I don't know where we are now.
This is the Hang Seng index
for Hong Kong.
And similar topography.
I wonder why.
And this is art. This is metaphor.
But I think the point is
that this is metaphor with teeth,
and it's with those teeth that I want to propose today
that we rethink a little bit
about the role of contemporary math --
not just financial math, but math in general.
That its transition
from being something that we extract and derive from the world
to something that actually starts to shape it --
the world around us and the world inside us.
And it's specifically algorithms,
which are basically the math
that computers use to decide stuff.
They acquire the sensibility of truth
because they repeat over and over again,
and they ossify and calcify,
and they become real.
And I was thinking about this, of all places,
on a transatlantic flight a couple of years ago,
because I happened to be seated
next to a Hungarian physicist about my age
and we were talking
about what life was like during the Cold War
for physicists in Hungary.
And I said, "So what were you doing?"
And he said, "Well we were mostly breaking stealth."
And I said, "That's a good job. That's interesting.
How does that work?"
And to understand that,
you have to understand a little bit about how stealth works.
And so -- this is an over-simplification --
but basically, it's not like
you can just pass a radar signal
right through 156 tons of steel in the sky.
It's not just going to disappear.
But if you can take this big, massive thing,
and you could turn it into
a million little things --
something like a flock of birds --
well then the radar that's looking for that
has to be able to see
every flock of birds in the sky.
And if you're a radar, that's a really bad job.
And he said, "Yeah." He said, "But that's if you're a radar.
So we didn't use a radar;
we built a black box that was looking for electrical signals,
electronic communication.
And whenever we saw a flock of birds that had electronic communication,
we thought, 'Probably has something to do with the Americans.'"
And I said, "Yeah.
That's good.
So you've effectively negated
60 years of aeronautic research.
What's your act two?
What do you do when you grow up?"
And he said,
"Well, financial services."
And I said, "Oh."
Because those had been in the news lately.
And I said, "How does that work?"
And he said, "Well there's 2,000 physicists on Wall Street now,
and I'm one of them."
And I said, "What's the black box for Wall Street?"
And he said, "It's funny you ask that,
because it's actually called black box trading.
And it's also sometimes called algo trading,
algorithmic trading."
And algorithmic trading evolved in part
because institutional traders have the same problems
that the United States Air Force had,
which is that they're moving these positions --
whether it's Proctor &amp; Gamble or Accenture, whatever --
they're moving a million shares of something
through the market.
And if they do that all at once,
it's like playing poker and going all in right away.
You just tip your hand.
And so they have to find a way --
and they use algorithms to do this --
to break up that big thing
into a million little transactions.
And the magic and the horror of that
is that the same math
that you use to break up the big thing
into a million little things
can be used to find a million little things
and sew them back together
and figure out what's actually happening in the market.
So if you need to have some image
of what's happening in the stock market right now,
what you can picture is a bunch of algorithms
that are basically programmed to hide,
and a bunch of algorithms that are programmed to go find them and act.
And all of that's great, and it's fine.
And that's 70 percent
of the United States stock market,
70 percent of the operating system
formerly known as your pension,
your mortgage.
And what could go wrong?
What could go wrong
is that a year ago,
nine percent of the entire market just disappears in five minutes,
and they called it the Flash Crash of 2:45.
All of a sudden, nine percent just goes away,
and nobody to this day
can even agree on what happened
because nobody ordered it, nobody asked for it.
Nobody had any control over what was actually happening.
All they had
was just a monitor in front of them
that had the numbers on it
and just a red button
that said, "Stop."
And that's the thing,
is that we're writing things,
we're writing these things that we can no longer read.
And we've rendered something
illegible,
and we've lost the sense
of what's actually happening
in this world that we've made.
And we're starting to make our way.
There's a company in Boston called Nanex,
and they use math and magic
and I don't know what,
and they reach into all the market data
and they find, actually sometimes, some of these algorithms.
And when they find them they pull them out
and they pin them to the wall like butterflies.
And they do what we've always done
when confronted with huge amounts of data that we don't understand --
which is that they give them a name
and a story.
So this is one that they found,
they called the Knife,
the Carnival,
the Boston Shuffler,
Twilight.
And the gag is
that, of course, these aren't just running through the market.
You can find these kinds of things wherever you look,
once you learn how to look for them.
You can find it here: this book about flies
that you may have been looking at on Amazon.
You may have noticed it
when its price started at 1.7 million dollars.
It's out of print -- still ...
(Laughter)
If you had bought it at 1.7, it would have been a bargain.
A few hours later, it had gone up
to 23.6 million dollars,
plus shipping and handling.
And the question is:
Nobody was buying or selling anything; what was happening?
And you see this behavior on Amazon
as surely as you see it on Wall Street.
And when you see this kind of behavior,
what you see is the evidence
of algorithms in conflict,
algorithms locked in loops with each other,
without any human oversight,
without any adult supervision
to say, "Actually, 1.7 million is plenty."
(Laughter)
And as with Amazon, so it is with Netflix.
And so Netflix has gone through
several different algorithms over the years.
They started with Cinematch, and they've tried a bunch of others --
there's Dinosaur Planet; there's Gravity.
They're using Pragmatic Chaos now.
Pragmatic Chaos is, like all of Netflix algorithms,
trying to do the same thing.
It's trying to get a grasp on you,
on the firmware inside the human skull,
so that it can recommend what movie
you might want to watch next --
which is a very, very difficult problem.
But the difficulty of the problem
and the fact that we don't really quite have it down,
it doesn't take away
from the effects Pragmatic Chaos has.
Pragmatic Chaos, like all Netflix algorithms,
determines, in the end,
60 percent
of what movies end up being rented.
So one piece of code
with one idea about you
is responsible for 60 percent of those movies.
But what if you could rate those movies
before they get made?
Wouldn't that be handy?
Well, a few data scientists from the U.K. are in Hollywood,
and they have "story algorithms" --
a company called Epagogix.
And you can run your script through there,
and they can tell you, quantifiably,
that that's a 30 million dollar movie
or a 200 million dollar movie.
And the thing is, is that this isn't Google.
This isn't information.
These aren't financial stats; this is culture.
And what you see here,
or what you don't really see normally,
is that these are the physics of culture.
And if these algorithms,
like the algorithms on Wall Street,
just crashed one day and went awry,
how would we know?
What would it look like?
And they're in your house. They're in your house.
These are two algorithms competing for your living room.
These are two different cleaning robots
that have very different ideas about what clean means.
And you can see it
if you slow it down and attach lights to them,
and they're sort of like secret architects in your bedroom.
And the idea that architecture itself
is somehow subject to algorithmic optimization
is not far-fetched.
It's super-real and it's happening around you.
You feel it most
when you're in a sealed metal box,
a new-style elevator;
they're called destination-control elevators.
These are the ones where you have to press what floor you're going to go to
before you get in the elevator.
And it uses what's called a bin-packing algorithm.
So none of this mishegas
of letting everybody go into whatever car they want.
Everybody who wants to go to the 10th floor goes into car two,
and everybody who wants to go to the third floor goes into car five.
And the problem with that
is that people freak out.
People panic.
And you see why. You see why.
It's because the elevator
is missing some important instrumentation, like the buttons.
(Laughter)
Like the things that people use.
All it has
is just the number that moves up or down
and that red button that says, "Stop."
And this is what we're designing for.
We're designing
for this machine dialect.
And how far can you take that? How far can you take it?
You can take it really, really far.
So let me take it back to Wall Street.
Because the algorithms of Wall Street
are dependent on one quality above all else,
which is speed.
And they operate on milliseconds and microseconds.
And just to give you a sense of what microseconds are,
it takes you 500,000 microseconds
just to click a mouse.
But if you're a Wall Street algorithm
and you're five microseconds behind,
you're a loser.
So if you were an algorithm,
you'd look for an architect like the one that I met in Frankfurt
who was hollowing out a skyscraper --
throwing out all the furniture, all the infrastructure for human use,
and just running steel on the floors
to get ready for the stacks of servers to go in --
all so an algorithm
could get close to the Internet.
And you think of the Internet as this kind of distributed system.
And of course, it is, but it's distributed from places.
In New York, this is where it's distributed from:
the Carrier Hotel
located on Hudson Street.
And this is really where the wires come right up into the city.
And the reality is that the further away you are from that,
you're a few microseconds behind every time.
These guys down on Wall Street,
Marco Polo and Cherokee Nation,
they're eight microseconds
behind all these guys
going into the empty buildings being hollowed out
up around the Carrier Hotel.
And that's going to keep happening.
We're going to keep hollowing them out,
because you, inch for inch
and pound for pound and dollar for dollar,
none of you could squeeze revenue out of that space
like the Boston Shuffler could.
But if you zoom out,
if you zoom out,
you would see an 825-mile trench
between New York City and Chicago
that's been built over the last few years
by a company called Spread Networks.
This is a fiber optic cable
that was laid between those two cities
to just be able to traffic one signal
37 times faster than you can click a mouse --
just for these algorithms,
just for the Carnival and the Knife.
And when you think about this,
that we're running through the United States
with dynamite and rock saws
so that an algorithm can close the deal
three microseconds faster,
all for a communications framework
that no human will ever know,
that's a kind of manifest destiny;
and we'll always look for a new frontier.
Unfortunately, we have our work cut out for us.
This is just theoretical.
This is some mathematicians at MIT.
And the truth is I don't really understand
a lot of what they're talking about.
It involves light cones and quantum entanglement,
and I don't really understand any of that.
But I can read this map,
and what this map says
is that, if you're trying to make money on the markets where the red dots are,
that's where people are, where the cities are,
you're going to have to put the servers where the blue dots are
to do that most effectively.
And the thing that you might have noticed about those blue dots
is that a lot of them are in the middle of the ocean.
So that's what we'll do: we'll build bubbles or something,
or platforms.
We'll actually part the water
to pull money out of the air,
because it's a bright future
if you're an algorithm.
(Laughter)
And it's not the money that's so interesting actually.
It's what the money motivates,
that we're actually terraforming
the Earth itself
with this kind of algorithmic efficiency.
And in that light,
you go back
and you look at Michael Najjar's photographs,
and you realize that they're not metaphor, they're prophecy.
They're prophecy
for the kind of seismic, terrestrial effects
of the math that we're making.
And the landscape was always made
by this sort of weird, uneasy collaboration
between nature and man.
But now there's this third co-evolutionary force: algorithms --
the Boston Shuffler, the Carnival.
And we will have to understand those as nature,
and in a way, they are.
Thank you.
(Applause)
It was April, last year.
I was on an evening out with friends
to celebrate one of their birthdays.
We hadn't been all together
for a couple of weeks;
it was a perfect evening,
as we were all reunited.
At the end of the evening,
I caught the last underground train
back to the other side of London.
The journey was smooth.
I got back to my local station
and I began the 10-minute walk home.
As I turned the corner onto my street,
my house in sight up ahead,
I heard footsteps behind me
that seemed to have
approached out of nowhere
and were picking up pace.
Before I had time to process
what was happening,
a hand was clapped around my mouth
so that I could not breathe,
and the young man behind me
dragged me to the ground,
beat my head repeatedly
against the pavement
until my face began to bleed,
kicking me in the back and neck
while he began to assault me,
ripping off my clothes
and telling me to "shut up,"
as I struggled to cry for help.
With each smack of my head
to the concrete ground,
a question echoed through my mind
that still haunts me today:
"Is this going to be how it all ends?"
Little could I have realized,
I'd been followed the whole way
from the moment I left the station.
And hours later,
I was standing topless and barelegged
in front of the police,
having the cuts and bruises
on my naked body photographed
for forensic evidence.
Now, there are few words to describe
the all-consuming feelings
of vulnerability, shame, upset
and injustice that I was ridden with
in that moment and for the weeks to come.
But wanting to find a way
to condense these feelings
into something ordered
that I could work through,
I decided to do what
felt most natural to me:
I wrote about it.
It started out as a cathartic exercise.
I wrote a letter to my assaulter,
humanizing him as "you,"
to identify him as part
of the very community
that he had so violently
abused that night.
Stressing the tidal-wave
effect of his actions,
I wrote:
"Did you ever think
of the people in your life?
I don't know who the people
in your life are.
I don't know anything about you.
But I do know this:
you did not just attack me that night.
I'm a daughter, I'm a friend,
I'm a sister, I'm a pupil,
I'm a cousin, I'm a niece,
I'm a neighbor;
I'm the employee
who served everyone coffee
in the café under the railway.
And all the people who form
these relations to me
make up my community.
And you assaulted
every single one of them.
You violated the truth that I
will never cease to fight for,
and which all of these people represent:
that there are infinitely more
good people in the world than bad."
But, determined not to let
this one incident make me lose faith
in the solidarity in my community
or humanity as a whole,
I recalled the 7/7 terrorist bombings
in July 2005 on London transport,
and how the mayor of London at the time,
and indeed my own parents,
had insisted that we all get back
on the tubes the next day,
so we wouldn't be defined or changed
by those that had made us feel unsafe.
I told my attacker,
"You've carried out your attack,
but now I'm getting back on my tube.
My community will not feel we are unsafe
walking home after dark.
We will get on the last tubes home,
and we will walk up our streets alone,
because we will not ingrain
or submit to the idea
that we are putting ourselves
in danger in doing so.
We will continue
to come together, like an army,
when any member
of our community is threatened.
And this is a fight you will not win."
At the time of writing this letter --
(Applause)
Thank you.
(Applause)
At the time of writing this letter,
I was studying for my exams in Oxford,
and I was working
on the local student paper there.
Despite being lucky enough to have
friends and family supporting me,
it was an isolating time.
I didn't know anyone
who'd been through this before;
at least I didn't think I did.
I'd read news reports, statistics,
and knew how common sexual assault was,
yet I couldn't actually name
a single person
that I'd heard speak out
about an experience of this kind before.
So in a somewhat spontaneous decision,
I decided that I would publish
my letter in the student paper,
hoping to reach out to others in Oxford
that might have had a similar experience
and be feeling the same way.
At the end of the letter,
I asked others to write in
with their experiences
under the hashtag, "#NotGuilty,"
to emphasize that survivors of assault
could express themselves
without feeling shame or guilt
about what happened to them --
to show that we could all
stand up to sexual assault.
What I never anticipated
is that almost overnight,
this published letter would go viral.
Soon, we were receiving
hundreds of stories
from men and women across the world,
which we began to publish
on a website I set up.
And the hashtag became a campaign.
There was an Australian mother in her 40s
who described how on an evening out,
she was followed to the bathroom
by a man who went
to repeatedly grab her crotch.
There was a man in the Netherlands
who described how he was date-raped
on a visit to London
and wasn't taken seriously
by anyone he reported his case to.
I had personal Facebook messages
from people in India and South America,
saying, how can we bring
the message of the campaign there?
One of the first contributions we had
was from a woman called Nikki,
who described growing up,
being molested my her own father.
And I had friends open up to me
about experiences ranging
from those that happened last week
to those that happened years ago,
that I'd had no idea about.
And the more we started
to receive these messages,
the more we also started
to receive messages of hope --
people feeling empowered
by this community of voices
standing up to sexual assault
and victim-blaming.
One woman called Olivia,
after describing how she was attacked
by someone she had trusted
and cared about for a long time,
said, "I've read many
of the stories posted here,
and I feel hopeful that if so many
women can move forward,
then I can, too.
I've been inspired by many,
and I hope I can be as strong
as them someday.
I'm sure I will."
People around the world began
tweeting under this hashtag,
and the letter was republished
and covered by the national press,
as well as being translated into several
other languages worldwide.
But something struck me
about the media attention
that this letter was attracting.
For something to be front-page news,
given the word "news" itself,
we can assume it must be something new
or something surprising.
And yet sexual assault
is not something new.
Sexual assault, along with other
kinds of injustices,
is reported in the media all the time.
But through the campaign,
these injustices were framed
as not just news stories,
they were firsthand experiences
that had affected real people,
who were creating,
with the solidarity of others,
what they needed
and had previously lacked:
a platform to speak out,
the reassurance they weren't alone
or to blame for what happened to them
and open discussions that would help
to reduce stigma around the issue.
The voices of those directly affected
were at the forefront of the story --
not the voices of journalists
or commentators on social media.
And that's why the story was news.
We live in an incredibly
interconnected world
with the proliferation of social media,
which is of course a fantastic resource
for igniting social change.
But it's also made us
increasingly reactive,
from the smallest annoyances
of, "Oh, my train's been delayed,"
to the greatest injustices of war,
genocides, terrorist attacks.
Our default response has become
to leap to react to any kind of grievance
by tweeting, Facebooking, hastagging --
anything to show others
that we, too, have reacted.
The problem with reacting
in this manner en masse
is it can sometimes mean
that we don't actually react at all,
not in the sense of actually
doing anything, anyway.
It might make ourselves feel better,
like we've contributed
to a group mourning or outrage,
but it doesn't actually change anything.
And what's more,
it can sometimes drown out the voices
of those directly
affected by the injustice,
whose needs must be heard.
Worrying, too, is the tendency
for some reactions to injustice
to build even more walls,
being quick to point fingers
with the hope of providing easy solutions
to complex problems.
One British tabloid,
on the publication of my letter,
branded a headline stating,
"Oxford Student Launches
Online Campaign to Shame Attacker."
But the campaign never
meant to shame anyone.
It meant to let people speak
and to make others listen.
Divisive Twitter trolls were quick
to create even more injustice,
commenting on
my attacker's ethnicity or class
to push their own prejudiced agendas.
And some even accused me
of feigning the whole thing
to push, and I quote,
my "feminist agenda of man-hating."
(Laughter)
I know, right?
As if I'm going to be like,
"Hey guys! Sorry I can't make it,
I'm busy trying to hate
the entire male population
by the time I'm 30."
(Laughter)
Now, I'm almost sure
that these people wouldn't say
the things they say in person.
But it's as if because they might
be behind a screen,
in the comfort in their own home
when on social media,
people forget that what
they're doing is a public act --
that other people will be reading it
and be affected by it.
Returning to my analogy
of getting back on our trains,
another main concern I have
about this noise that escalates
from our online responses to injustice
is that it can very easily slip
into portraying us as the affected party,
which can lead to a sense of defeatism,
a kind of mental barrier to seeing
any opportunity for positivity or change
after a negative situation.
A couple of months
before the campaign started
or any of this happened to me,
I went to a TEDx event in Oxford,
and I saw Zelda la Grange speak,
the former private secretary
to Nelson Mandela.
One of the stories
she told really struck me.
She spoke of when
Mandela was taken to court
by the South African Rugby Union
after he commissioned
an inquiry into sports affairs.
In the courtroom,
he went up to the South African
Rugby Union's lawyers,
shook them by the hand
and conversed with them,
each in their own language.
And Zelda wanted to protest,
saying they had no right to his respect
after this injustice they had caused him.
He turned to her and said,
"You must never allow the enemy
to determine the grounds for battle."
At the time of hearing these words,
I didn't really know why
they were so important,
but I felt they were, and I wrote them
down in a notebook I had on me.
But I've thought about this line
a lot ever since.
Revenge, or the expression of hatred
towards those who have done us injustice
may feel like a human instinct
in the face of wrong,
but we need to break out of these cycles
if we are to hope to transform
negative events of injustice
into positive social change.
To do otherwise
continues to let the enemy
determine the grounds for battle,
creates a binary,
where we who have suffered
become the affected,
pitted against them, the perpetrators.
And just like we got back on our tubes,
we can't let our platforms
for interconnectivity and community
be the places that we settle for defeat.
But I don't want to discourage
a social media response,
because I owe the development
of the #NotGuilty campaign
almost entirely to social media.
But I do want to encourage
a more considered approach
to the way we use it
to respond to injustice.
The start, I think,
is to ask ourselves two things.
Firstly: Why do I feel this injustice?
In my case, there were
several answers to this.
Someone had hurt me and those who I loved,
under the assumption they
wouldn't have to be held to account
or recognize the damage they had caused.
Not only that, but thousands
of men and women suffer every day
from sexual abuse, often in silence,
yet it's still a problem we don't give
the same airtime to as other issues.
It's still an issue many people
blame victims for.
Next, ask yourself: How,
in recognizing these reasons,
could I go about reversing them?
With us, this was holding my attacker
to account -- and many others.
It was calling them out
on the effect they had caused.
It was giving airtime
to the issue of sexual assault,
opening up discussions amongst friends,
amongst families, in the media
that had been closed for too long,
and stressing that victims
shouldn't feel to blame
for what happened to them.
We might still have a long way to go
in solving this problem entirely.
But in this way,
we can begin to use social media
as an active tool for social justice,
as a tool to educate,
to stimulate dialogues,
to make those in positions
of authority aware of an issue
by listening to those
directly affected by it.
Because sometimes these questions
don't have easy answers.
In fact, they rarely do.
But this doesn't mean we still
can't give them a considered response.
In situations where
you can't go about thinking
how you'd reverse
this feeling of injustice,
you can still think,
maybe not what you can do,
but what you can not do.
You can not build further walls
by fighting injustice with more prejudice,
more hatred.
You can not speak over those
directly affected by an injustice.
And you can not react to injustice,
only to forget about it the next day,
just because the rest
of Twitter has moved on.
Sometimes not reacting
instantly is, ironically,
the best immediate course
of action we can take.
Because we might be angry, upset
and energized by injustice,
but let's consider our responses.
Let us hold people to account,
without descending into a culture
that thrives off shaming
and injustice ourselves.
Let us remember that distinction,
so often forgotten by internet users,
between criticism and insult.
Let us not forget
to think before we speak,
just because we might
have a screen in front of us.
And when we create noise on social media,
let it not drown out the needs
of those affected,
but instead let it amplify their voices,
so the internet becomes a place
where you're not the exception
if you speak out about something
that has actually happened to you.
All these considered
approaches to injustice
evoke the very keystones
on which the internet was built:
to network, to have signal, to connect --
all these terms that imply
bringing people together,
not pushing people apart.
Because if you look up the word
"justice" in the dictionary,
before punishment,
before administration of law
or judicial authority,
you get:
"The maintenance of what is right."
And I think there are few things
more "right" in this world
than bringing people together,
than unions.
And if we allow social media
to deliver that,
then it can deliver a very powerful
form of justice, indeed.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
After decades of research
and billions of dollars
spent in clinical trials,
we still have a problem
with cancer drug delivery.
We still give patients chemotherapy,
which is so non-specific
that even though
it kills the cancer cells,
it kind of kills
the rest of your body, too.
And yes, we have developed
more selective drugs,
but it's still a challenge
to get them into the tumor,
and they end up accumulating
in the other organs as well
or passing through your urine,
which is a total waste.
And fields like mine have emerged
where we try to encapsulate these drugs
to protect them as they
travel through the body.
But these modifications cause problems
that we make more modifications to fix.
So what I'm really trying to say
is we need a better drug delivery system.
And I propose,
rather than using solely human design,
why not use nature's?
Immune cells are these versatile vehicles
that travel throughout our body,
patrolling for signs of disease
and arriving at a wound
mere minutes after injury.
So I ask you guys:
If immune cells are already traveling
to places of injury or disease
in our bodies,
why not add an extra passenger?
Why not use immune cells to deliver drugs
to cure some of our biggest problems
in disease?
I am a biomedical engineer,
and I want to tell you guys a story
about how I use immune cells
to target one of the largest
problems in cancer.
Did you know that over 90 percent
of cancer deaths
can be attributed to its spread?
So if we can stop these cancer cells
from going from the primary tumor
to a distant site,
we can stop cancer right in its tracks
and give people more of their lives back.
To do this special mission,
we decided to deliver
a nanoparticle made of lipids,
which are the same materials
that compose your cell membrane.
And we've added two special molecules.
One is called e-selectin,
which acts as a glue
that binds the nanoparticle
to the immune cell.
And the second one is called trail.
Trail is a therapeutic drug
that kills cancer cells
but not normal cells.
Now, when you put both of these together,
you have a mean killing machine on wheels.
To test this, we ran
an experiment in a mouse.
So what we did was we injected
the nanoparticles,
and they bound almost immediately
to the immune cells in the bloodstream.
And then we injected the cancer cells
to mimic a process
through which cancer cells
spread throughout our bodies.
And we found something very exciting.
We found that in our treated group,
over 75 percent of the cancer cells
we initially injected were dead or dying,
in comparison to only around 25 percent.
So just imagine: these fewer
amount of cells were available
to actually be able to spread
to a different part of the body.
And this is only after
two hours of treatment.
Our results were amazing,
and we had some pretty interesting press.
My favorite title was actually,
"Sticky balls may stop
the spread of cancer."
(Laughter)
I can't tell you just how smug
my male colleagues were,
knowing that their sticky balls
might one day cure cancer.
(Laughter)
But I can tell you they made
some pretty, pretty, exciting,
pretty ballsy t-shirts.
This was also my first experience
talking to patients
where they asked how soon
our therapy would be available.
And I keep these stories with me
to remind me of the importance
of the science,
the scientists and the patients.
Now, our fast-acting results
were pretty interesting,
but we still had one lingering question:
Can our sticky balls,
our particles actually attached
to the immune cells,
actually stop the spread of cancer?
So we went to our animal model,
and we found three important parts.
Our primary tumors were smaller
in our treated animals,
there were fewer cells in circulation,
and there was little to no
tumor burden in the distant organs.
Now, this wasn't just a victory
for us and our sticky balls.
This was also a victory to me
in drug delivery,
and it represents a paradigm shift,
a revolution --
to go from just using drugs,
just injecting them
and hoping they go to the right
places in the body,
to using immune cells
as special delivery drivers in your body.
For this example, we used two molecules,
e-selectin and trail,
but really, the possibility
of drugs you can use are endless.
And I talked about cancer,
but where disease goes,
so do immune cells.
So this could be used for any disease.
Imagine using immune cells
to deliver crucial wound-healing agents
after a spinal cord injury,
or using immune cells to deliver drugs
past the blood-brain barrier
to treat Parkinson's
or Alzheimer's disease.
These are the ideas that excite me
about science the most.
And from where I stand,
I see so much promise and opportunity.
Thank you.
(Applause)
This is the Bop.
The Bop is a type of social dance.
Dance is a language,
and social dance is an expression
that emerges from a community.
A social dance isn't choreographed
by any one person.
It can't be traced to any one moment.
Each dance has steps
that everyone can agree on,
but it's about the individual
and their creative identity.
Because of that,
social dances bubble up,
they change
and they spread like wildfire.
They are as old as our remembered history.
In African-American social dances,
we see over 200 years
of how African and African-American
traditions influenced our history.
The present always contains the past.
And the past shapes who we are
and who we will be.
(Clapping)
The Juba dance was born
from enslaved Africans' experience
on the plantation.
Brought to the Americas,
stripped of a common spoken language,
this dance was a way for enslaved Africans
to remember where they're from.
It may have looked something like this.
Slapping thighs,
shuffling feet
and patting hands:
this was how they got around
the slave owners' ban on drumming,
improvising complex rhythms
just like ancestors did
with drums in Haiti
or in the Yoruba communities
of West Africa.
It was about keeping
cultural traditions alive
and retaining a sense of inner freedom
under captivity.
It was the same subversive spirit
that created this dance:
the Cakewalk,
a dance that parodied the mannerisms
of Southern high society --
a way for the enslaved
to throw shade at the masters.
The crazy thing about this dance
is that the Cakewalk
was performed for the masters,
who never suspected
they were being made fun of.
Now you might recognize this one.
1920s --
the Charleston.
The Charleston was all about
improvisation and musicality,
making its way into Lindy Hop,
swing dancing
and even the Kid n Play,
originally called the Funky Charleston.
Started by a tight-knit Black community
near Charleston, South Carolina,
the Charleston permeated dance halls
where young women suddenly had
the freedom to kick their heels
and move their legs.
Now, social dance is about
community and connection;
if you knew the steps,
it meant you belonged to a group.
But what if it becomes a worldwide craze?
Enter the Twist.
It's no surprise that the Twist
can be traced back to the 19th century,
brought to America from the Congo
during slavery.
But in the late '50s,
right before the Civil Rights Movement,
the Twist is popularized
by Chubby Checker and Dick Clark.
Suddenly, everybody's doing the Twist:
white teenagers,
kids in Latin America,
making its way into songs and movies.
Through social dance,
the boundaries between groups
become blurred.
The story continues in the 1980s and '90s.
Along with the emergence of hip-hop,
African-American social dance
took on even more visibility,
borrowing from its long past,
shaping culture and being shaped by it.
Today, these dances continue
to evolve, grow and spread.
Why do we dance?
To move,
to let loose,
to express.
Why do we dance together?
To heal,
to remember,
to say: "We speak a common language.
We exist
and we are free."
I'd like to show you a video of some of the models
I work with.
They're all the perfect size, and they don't have an ounce of fat.
Did I mention they're gorgeous?
And they're scientific models? (Laughs)
As you might have guessed, I'm a tissue engineer,
and this is a video of some of the beating heart
that I've engineered in the lab.
And one day we hope that these tissues
can serve as replacement parts for the human body.
But what I'm going to tell you about today
is how these tissues make awesome models.
Well, let's think about the drug screening process for a moment.
You go from drug formulation, lab testing, animal testing,
and then clinical trials, which you might call human testing,
before the drugs get to market.
It costs a lot of money, a lot of time,
and sometimes, even when a drug hits the market,
it acts in an unpredictable way and actually hurts people.
And the later it fails, the worse the consequences.
It all boils down to two issues. One, humans are not rats,
and two, despite our incredible similarities to one another,
actually those tiny differences between you and I
have huge impacts with how we metabolize drugs
and how those drugs affect us.
So what if we had better models in the lab
that could not only mimic us better than rats
but also reflect our diversity?
Let's see how we can do it with tissue engineering.
One of the key technologies that's really important
is what's called induced pluripotent stem cells.
They were developed in Japan pretty recently.
Okay, induced pluripotent stem cells.
They're a lot like embryonic stem cells
except without the controversy.
We induce cells, okay, say, skin cells,
by adding a few genes to them, culturing them,
and then harvesting them.
So they're skin cells that can be tricked,
kind of like cellular amnesia, into an embryonic state.
So without the controversy, that's cool thing number one.
Cool thing number two, you can grow any type of tissue
out of them: brain, heart, liver, you get the picture,
but out of your cells.
So we can make a model of your heart, your brain
on a chip.
Generating tissues of predictable density and behavior
is the second piece, and will be really key towards
getting these models to be adopted for drug discovery.
And this is a schematic of a bioreactor we're developing in our lab
to help engineer tissues in a more modular, scalable way.
Going forward, imagine a massively parallel version of this
with thousands of pieces of human tissue.
It would be like having a clinical trial on a chip.
But another thing about these induced pluripotent stem cells
is that if we take some skin cells, let's say,
from people with a genetic disease
and we engineer tissues out of them,
we can actually use tissue-engineering techniques
to generate models of those diseases in the lab.
Here's an example from Kevin Eggan's lab at Harvard.
He generated neurons
from these induced pluripotent stem cells
from patients who have Lou Gehrig's Disease,
and he differentiated them into neurons, and what's amazing
is that these neurons also show symptoms of the disease.
So with disease models like these, we can fight back
faster than ever before and understand the disease better
than ever before, and maybe discover drugs even faster.
This is another example of patient-specific stem cells
that were engineered from someone with retinitis pigmentosa.
This is a degeneration of the retina.
It's a disease that runs in my family, and we really hope
that cells like these will help us find a cure.
So some people think that these models sound well and good,
but ask, "Well, are these really as good as the rat?"
The rat is an entire organism, after all,
with interacting networks of organs.
A drug for the heart can get metabolized in the liver,
and some of the byproducts may be stored in the fat.
Don't you miss all that with these tissue-engineered models?
Well, this is another trend in the field.
By combining tissue engineering techniques with microfluidics,
the field is actually evolving towards just that,
a model of the entire ecosystem of the body,
complete with multiple organ systems to be able to test
how a drug you might take for your blood pressure
might affect your liver or an antidepressant might affect your heart.
These systems are really hard to build, but we're just starting to be able to get there,
and so, watch out.
But that's not even all of it, because once a drug is approved,
tissue engineering techniques can actually help us develop more personalized treatments.
This is an example that you might care about someday,
and I hope you never do,
because imagine if you ever get that call
that gives you that bad news that you might have cancer.
Wouldn't you rather test to see if those cancer drugs
you're going to take are going to work on your cancer?
This is an example from Karen Burg's lab, where they're
using inkjet technologies to print breast cancer cells
and study its progressions and treatments.
And some of our colleagues at Tufts are mixing models
like these with tissue-engineered bone to see how cancer
might spread from one part of the body to the next,
and you can imagine those kinds of multi-tissue chips
to be the next generation of these kinds of studies.
And so thinking about the models that we've just discussed,
you can see, going forward, that tissue engineering
is actually poised to help revolutionize drug screening
at every single step of the path:
disease models making for better drug formulations,
massively parallel human tissue models helping to revolutionize lab testing,
reduce animal testing and human testing in clinical trials,
and individualized therapies that disrupt
what we even consider to be a market at all.
Essentially, we're dramatically speeding up that feedback
between developing a molecule and learning about
how it acts in the human body.
Our process for doing this is essentially transforming
biotechnology and pharmacology into an information technology,
helping us discover and evaluate drugs faster,
more cheaply and more effectively.
It gives new meaning to models against animal testing, doesn't it?
Thank you. (Applause)
Every day, I listen to harrowing stories
of people fleeing for their lives,
across dangerous borders
and unfriendly seas.
But there's one story
that keeps me awake at night,
and it's about Doaa.
A Syrian refugee, 19 years old,
she was living a grinding existence
in Egypt working day wages.
Her dad was constantly thinking
of his thriving business back in Syria
that had been blown to pieces by a bomb.
And the war that drove them there
was still raging in its fourth year.
And the community
that once welcomed them there
had become weary of them.
And one day, men on motorcycles
tried to kidnap her.
Once an aspiring student
thinking only of her future,
now she was scared all the time.
But she was also full of hope,
because she was in love
with a fellow Syrian refugee named Bassem.
Bassem was also struggling in Egypt,
and he said to Doaa,
"Let's go to Europe; seek asylum, safety.
I will work, you can study --
the promise of a new life."
And he asked her father
for her hand in marriage.
But they knew to get to Europe
they had to risk their lives,
traveling across the Mediterranean Sea,
putting their hands in smugglers',
notorious for their cruelty.
And Doaa was terrified of the water.
She always had been.
She never learned to swim.
It was August that year,
and already 2,000 people had died
trying to cross the Mediterranean,
but Doaa knew of a friend who had made it
all the way to Northern Europe,
and she thought, "Maybe we can, too."
So she asked her parents if they could go,
and after a painful discussion,
they consented,
and Bassem paid his entire life savings --
2,500 dollars each --
to the smugglers.
It was a Saturday morning
when the call came,
and they were taken by bus to a beach,
hundreds of people on the beach.
They were taken then by small boats
onto an old fishing boat,
500 of them crammed onto that boat,
300 below, [200] above.
There were Syrians, Palestinians,
Africans, Muslims and Christians,
100 children, including Sandra --
little Sandra, six years old --
and Masa, 18 months.
There were families on that boat,
crammed together shoulder to shoulder,
feet to feet.
Doaa was sitting with her legs
crammed up to her chest,
Bassem holding her hand.
Day two on the water,
they were sick with worry
and sick to their stomachs
from the rough sea.
Day three, Doaa had a premonition.
And she said to Bassem,
"I fear we're not going to make it.
I fear the boat is going to sink."
And Bassem said to her,
"Please be patient.
We will make it to Sweden,
we will get married
and we will have a future."
Day four, the passengers
were getting agitated.
They asked the captain,
"When will we get there?"
He told them to shut up,
and he insulted them.
He said, "In 16 hours we will reach
the shores of Italy."
They were weak and weary.
Soon they saw a boat approach --
a smaller boat, 10 men on board,
who started shouting at them,
hurling insults,
throwing sticks, asking them
to all disembark
and get on this smaller,
more unseaworthy boat.
The parents were terrified
for their children,
and they collectively
refused to disembark.
So the boat sped away in anger,
and a half an hour later, came back
and started deliberately ramming a hole
in the side of Doaa's boat,
just below where she
and Bassem were sitting.
And she heard how they yelled,
"Let the fish eat your flesh!"
And they started laughing
as the boat capsized and sank.
The 300 people below deck were doomed.
Doaa was holding on to the side
of the boat as it sank,
and watched in horror as a small child
was cut to pieces by the propeller.
Bassem said to her, "Please let go,
or you'll be swept in and the propeller
will kill you, too."
And remember -- she can't swim.
But she let go and she started moving
her arms and her legs,
thinking, "This is swimming."
And miraculously,
Bassem found a life ring.
It was one of those child's rings
that they use to play
in swimming pools and on calm seas.
And Doaa climbed onto the ring,
her arms and her legs
dangling by the side.
Bassem was a good swimmer,
so he held her hand and tread water.
Around them there were corpses.
Around 100 people survived initially,
and they started coming together
in groups, praying for rescue.
But when a day went by and no one came,
some people gave up hope,
and Doaa and Bassem watched
as men in the distance took their
life vests off and sank into the water.
One man approached them
with a small baby perched on his shoulder,
nine months old -- Malek.
He was holding onto a gas canister
to stay afloat, and he said to them,
"I fear I am not going to survive.
I'm too weak. I don't have
the courage anymore."
And he handed little Malek
over to Bassem and to Doaa,
and they perched her onto the life ring.
So now they were three,
Doaa, Bassem and little Malek.
And let me take a pause
in this story right here
and ask the question:
why do refugees like Doaa
take these kinds of risks?
Millions of refugees are living
in exile, in limbo.
They're living in countries [fleeing]
from a war that has been raging
for four years.
Even if they wanted to return, they can't.
Their homes, their businesses,
their towns and their cities
have been completely destroyed.
This is a UNESCO World Heritage City,
Homs, in Syria.
So people continue to flee
into neighboring countries,
and we build refugee camps
for them in the desert.
Hundreds of thousands of people
live in camps like these,
and thousands and thousands more,
millions, live in towns and cities.
And the communities,
the neighboring countries
that once welcomed them
with open arms and hearts
are overwhelmed.
There are simply not enough schools,
water systems, sanitation.
Even rich European countries
could never handle such an influx
without massive investment.
The Syria war has driven almost
four million people over the borders,
but over seven million people
are on the run inside the country.
That means that over half
the Syrian population
has been forced to flee.
Back to those neighboring
countries hosting so many.
They feel that the richer world
has done too little to support them.
And days have turned into months,
months into years.
A refugee's stay is supposed
to be temporary.
Back to Doaa and Bassem in the water.
It was their second day,
and Bassem was getting very weak.
And now it was Doaa's turn
to say to Bassem,
"My love, please hold on to hope,
to our future. We will make it."
And he said to her,
"I'm sorry, my love,
that I put you in this situation.
I have never loved anyone
as much as I love you."
And he released himself into the water,
and Doaa watched as the love of her life
drowned before her eyes.
Later that day,
a mother came up to Doaa with her
small 18-month-old daughter, Masa.
This was the little girl I showed you
in the picture earlier,
with the life vests.
Her older sister Sandra had just drowned,
and her mother knew she had to do
everything in her power
to save her daughter.
And she said to Doaa,
"Please take this child.
Let her be part of you.
I will not survive."
And then she went away and drowned.
So Doaa, the 19-year-old refugee
who was terrified of the water,
who couldn't swim,
found herself in charge
of two little baby kids.
And they were thirsty and they were hungry
and they were agitated,
and she tried her best to amuse them,
to sing to them, to say words
to them from the Quran.
Around them, the bodies were bloating
and turning black.
The sun was blazing during the day.
At night, there was a cold moon and fog.
It was very frightening.
On the fourth day in the water,
this is how Doaa probably looked
on the ring with her two children.
A woman came on the fourth day
and approached her
and asked her to take another child --
a little boy, just four years old.
When Doaa took the little boy
and the mother drowned,
she said to the sobbing child,
"She just went away
to find you water and food."
But his heart soon stopped,
and Doaa had to release
the little boy into the water.
Later that day,
she looked up into the sky with hope,
because she saw two planes
crossing in the sky.
And she waved her arms,
hoping they would see her,
but the planes were soon gone.
But that afternoon,
as the sun was going down,
she saw a boat, a merchant vessel.
And she said, "Please, God,
let them rescue me."
She waved her arms and she felt
like she shouted for about two hours.
And it had become dark,
but finally the searchlights found her
and they extended a rope,
astonished to see a woman
clutching onto two babies.
They pulled them onto the boat,
they got oxygen and blankets,
and a Greek helicopter came
to pick them up
and take them to the island of Crete.
But Doaa looked down and asked,
"What of Malek?"
And they told her the little baby
did not survive --
she drew her last breath
in the boat's clinic.
But Doaa was sure that as they had
been pulled up onto the rescue boat,
that little baby girl had been smiling.
Only 11 people survived
that wreck, of the 500.
There was never an international
investigation into what happened.
There were some media reports
about mass murder at sea,
a terrible tragedy,
but that was only for one day.
And then the news cycle moved on.
Meanwhile, in a pediatric
hospital on Crete,
little Masa was on the edge of death.
She was really dehydrated.
Her kidneys were failing.
Her glucose levels were dangerously low.
The doctors did everything
in their medical power to save them,
and the Greek nurses never left her side,
holding her, hugging her,
singing her words.
My colleagues also visited
and said pretty words to her in Arabic.
Amazingly, little Masa survived.
And soon the Greek press started reporting
about the miracle baby,
who had survived four days in the water
without food or anything to drink,
and offers to adopt her came
from all over the country.
And meanwhile, Doaa
was in another hospital on Crete,
thin, dehydrated.
An Egyptian family took her into their
home as soon as she was released.
And soon word went around
about Doaa's survival,
and a phone number
was published on Facebook.
Messages started coming in.
"Doaa, do you know
what happened to my brother?
My sister? My parents? My friends?
Do you know if they survived?"
One of those messages said,
"I believe you saved
my little niece, Masa."
And it had this photo.
This was from Masa's uncle,
a Syrian refugee who had made it
to Sweden with his family
and also Masa's older sister.
Soon, we hope, Masa will be reunited
with him in Sweden,
and until then, she's being cared for
in a beautiful orphanage in Athens.
And Doaa? Well, word went around
about her survival, too.
And the media wrote
about this slight woman,
and couldn't imagine how
she could survive all this time
under such conditions in that sea,
and still save another life.
The Academy of Athens, one of Greece's
most prestigious institutions,
gave her an award of bravery,
and she deserves all that praise,
and she deserves a second chance.
But she wants to still go to Sweden.
She wants to reunite
with her family there.
She wants to bring her mother
and her father and her younger siblings
away from Egypt there as well,
and I believe she will succeed.
She wants to become a lawyer
or a politician
or something that can help
fight injustice.
She is an extraordinary survivor.
But I have to ask:
what if she didn't have to take that risk?
Why did she have to go through all that?
Why wasn't there a legal way
for her to study in Europe?
Why couldn't Masa have taken
an airplane to Sweden?
Why couldn't Bassem have found work?
Why is there no massive resettlement
program for Syrian refugees,
the victims of the worst war of our times?
The world did this for the Vietnamese
in the 1970s. Why not now?
Why is there so little investment
in the neighboring countries
hosting so many refugees?
And why, the root question,
is so little being done to stop
the wars, the persecution
and the poverty that is driving
so many people
to the shores of Europe?
Until these issues are resolved,
people will continue to take to the seas
and to seek safety and asylum.
And what happens next?
Well, that is largely Europe's choice.
And I understand the public fears.
People are worried about their security,
their economies, the changes of culture.
But is that more important
than saving human lives?
Because there is something
fundamental here
that I think overrides the rest,
and it is about our common humanity.
No person fleeing war or persecution
should have to die
crossing a sea to reach safety.
(Applause)
One thing is for sure,
that no refugee would be
on those dangerous boats
if they could thrive where they are.
And no migrant would take
that dangerous journey
if they had enough food
for themselves and their children.
And no one would put their life savings
in the hands of those notorious smugglers
if there was a legal way to migrate.
So on behalf of little Masa
and on behalf of Doaa
and of Bassem
and of those 500 people
who drowned with them,
can we make sure that they
did not die in vain?
Could we be inspired by what happened,
and take a stand for a world
in which every life matters?
Thank you.
(Applause)
I've been intrigued by this question
of whether we could evolve
or develop a sixth sense --
a sense that would give us seamless access
and easy access to meta-information
or information that may exist somewhere
that may be relevant to help us
make the right decision
about whatever it is
that we're coming across.
And some of you may argue,
"Well, don't today's cell phones
do that already?"
But I would say no.
When you meet someone here at TED --
and this is the top networking place,
of course, of the year --
you don't shake somebody's hand
and then say,
"Can you hold on for a moment
while I take out my phone and Google you?"
Or when you go to the supermarket
and you're standing there
in that huge aisle
of different types of toilet papers,
you don't take out your cell phone,
and open a browser,
and go to a website to try to decide
which of these different toilet papers
is the most ecologically
responsible purchase to make.
So we don't really have easy access
to all this relevant information
that can just help us
make optimal decisions
about what to do next
and what actions to take.
And so my research group at the Media Lab
has been developing a series of inventions
to give us access to this information
in a sort of easy way,
without requiring that the user
changes any of their behavior.
And I'm here to unveil our latest effort,
and most successful effort so far,
which is still very much
a work in process.
I'm actually wearing the device right now
and we've sort of cobbled it together
with components that are off the shelf --
and that, by the way, only cost
350 dollars at this point in time.
I'm wearing a camera,
just a simple web cam,
a portable, battery-powered
projection system with a little mirror.
These components communicate
to my cell phone in my pocket
which acts as the communication
and computation device.
And in the video here we see
my student Pranav Mistry,
who's really the genius
who's been implementing
and designing this whole system.
And we see how this system
lets him walk up to any surface
and start using his hands
to interact with the information
that is projected in front of him.
The system tracks
the four significant fingers.
In this case, he's wearing
simple marker caps
that you may recognize.
But if you want a more stylish version,
you could also paint your nails
in different colors.
And the camera basically
tracks these four fingers
and recognizes any gestures
that he's making
so he can just go to,
for example, a map of Long Beach,
zoom in and out, etc.
The system also recognizes iconic gestures
such as the "take a picture" gesture,
and then takes a picture
of whatever is in front of you.
And when he then walks
back to the Media Lab,
he can just go up to any wall
and project all the pictures
that he's taken,
sort through them and organize them,
and re-size them, etc.,
again using all natural gestures.
So, some of you most likely
were here two years ago
and saw the demo by Jeff Han,
or some of you may think,
"Well, doesn't this look like
the Microsoft Surface Table?"
And yes, you also interact
using natural gestures,
both hands, etc.
But the difference here
is that you can use any surface,
you can walk up to any surface,
including your hand,
if nothing else is available,
and interact with this projected data.
The device is completely
portable, and can be --
(Applause)
(Applause ends)
So, one important difference
is that it's totally mobile.
Another even more important
difference is that in mass production,
this would not cost more tomorrow
than today's cell phones
and would actually not
sort of be a bigger packaging --
could look a lot more stylish
than this version
that I'm wearing around my neck.
But other than letting some of you
live out your fantasy
of looking as cool as Tom Cruise
in "Minority Report,"
the reason why we're really
excited about this device
is that it really can act
as one of these sixth-sense devices
that gives you relevant information
about whatever is in front of you.
So we see Pranav here
going into the supermarket
and he's shopping for some paper towels.
And, as he picks up a product,
the system can recognize
the product that he's picking up,
using either image recognition
or marker technology,
and give him the green light
or an orange light.
He can ask for additional information.
So this particular choice here
is a particularly good choice,
given his personal criteria.
Some of you may want the toilet paper
with the most bleach in it
rather than the most ecologically
responsible choice.
(Laughter)
If he picks up a book in the bookstore,
he can get an Amazon rating --
it gets projected
right on the cover of the book.
This is Juan's book, our previous speaker,
which gets a great rating,
by the way, at Amazon.
And so, Pranav turns the page of the book
and can then see additional
information about the book --
reader comments, maybe sort of information
by his favorite critic, etc.
If he turns to a particular page,
he finds an annotation by maybe
an expert or a friend of ours
that gives him a little bit
of additional information
about whatever is on that particular page.
Reading the newspaper --
it never has to be outdated.
(Laughter)
You can get video annotations
of the events that you're reading about.
You can get the latest sports scores, etc.
This is a more controversial one.
(Laughter)
As you interact with someone at TED,
maybe you can see
a word cloud of the tags,
the words that are associated
with that person
in their blog and personal web pages.
In this case, the student
is interested in cameras, etc.
On your way to the airport,
if you pick up your boarding pass, it can
tell you that your flight is delayed,
that the gate has changed, etc.
And, if you need to know
what the current time is,
it's as simple as drawing a watch --
(Laughter)
(Applause)
on your arm.
So that's where we're at so far
in developing this sixth sense
that would give us seamless access
to all this relevant information
about the things that we may come across.
My student Pranav, who's really,
like I said, the genius behind this.
(Applause and cheering)
(Applause ends)
He does deserve a lot of applause,
because I don't think he's slept much
in the last three months, actually.
And his girlfriend is probably
not very happy about him either.
But it's not perfect yet,
it's very much a work in progress.
And who knows, maybe in another 10 years
we'll be here with the ultimate
sixth sense brain implant.
Thank you.
(Applause)
But anyway, this is about the evils of science, so I think it’s perfect.

Hank Willis Thomas: I'm Deb's son.
(Laughter)
Deborah Willis: And I'm Hank's mom.
HWT: We've said that so many times,
we've made a piece about it.
It's called "Sometimes
I See Myself In You,"
and it speaks to
the symbiotic relationship
that we've developed over the years
through our life and work.
And really, it's because everywhere we go,
together or apart,
we carry these monikers.
I've been following
in my mother's footsteps
since before I was even born
and haven't figured out how to stop.
And as I get older, it does get harder.
No seriously, it gets harder.
(Laughter)
My mother's taught me many things, though,
most of all that love overrules.
She's taught me that love
is an action,
not a feeling.
Love is a way of being,
it's a way of doing,
it's a way of listening
and it's a way of seeing.
DW: And also, the idea about love,
photographers,
they're looking for love
when they make photographs.
They're looking and looking
and finding love.
Growing up in North Philadelphia,
I was surrounded by people
in my family and friends
who made photographs
and used the family camera
as a way of telling a story about life,
about life of joy,
about what it meant
to become a family in North Philadelphia.
So I spent most of my life
searching for pictures
that reflect on ideas
about black love, black joy
and about family life.
So it's really important to think about
the action of love overrules as a verb.
HWT: Sometimes I wonder
if the love of looking is genetic,
because, like my mother,
I've loved photographs
since before I can even remember.
I think sometimes that --
after my mother and her mother --
that photography and photographs
were my first love.
No offense to my father,
but that's what you get
for calling me a "ham"
wherever you go.
I remember whenever I'd go
to my grandmother's house,
she would hide all the photo albums
because she was afraid of me asking,
"Well, who is that in that picture?"
and "Who are they to you
and who are they to me,
and how old were you
when that picture was taken?
How old was I when that picture was taken?
And why were they in black and white?
Was the world in black and white
before I was born?"
DW: Well, that's interesting,
just to think about the world
in black and white.
I grew up in a beauty shop
in North Philadelphia,
my mom's beauty shop,
looking at "Ebony Magazine,"
found images that told stories
that were often not in the daily news,
but in the family album.
I wanted the family album
to be energetic for me,
a way of telling stories,
and one day I happened upon a book
in the Philadelphia Public Library
called "The Sweet Flypaper of Life"
by Roy DeCarava and Langston Hughes.
I think what attracted me
as a seven-year-old,
the title, flypaper and sweet,
but to think about that
as a seven-year-old,
I looked at the beautiful images
that Roy DeCarava made
and then looked at ways
that I could tell a story about life.
And looking for me is the act
that basically changed my life.
HWT: My friend Chris Johnson
told me that every photographer,
every artist, is essentially
trying to answer one question,
and I think your question might have been,
"Why doesn't the rest of the world
see how beautiful we are,
and what can I do to help them
see our community the way I do?"
DW: While studying in art school --
it's probably true --
I had a male professor who told me
that I was taking up a good man's space.
He tried to stifle my dream
of becoming a photographer.
He attempted to shame me
in a class full of male photographers.
He told me I was out of place
and out of order as a woman,
and he went on to say
that all you could and would do
was to have a baby when a good man
could have had your seat in this class.
I was shocked into silence
into that experience.
But I had my camera,
and I was determined to prove to him
that I was worthy
for a seat in that class.
But in retrospect, I asked myself:
"Why did I need to prove it to him?"
You know, I had my camera,
and I knew I needed to prove to myself
that I would make
a difference in photography.
I love photography, and no one
is going to stop me from making images.
HWT: But that's when I came in.
DW: Yeah, that year I graduated,
I got pregnant.
Yep, he was right.
And I had you,
and I shook off that sexist language
that he used against me
and picked up my camera
and made photographs daily,
and made photographs of my pregnant belly
as I prepared for graduate school.
But I thought about also
that black photographers were missing
from the history books of photography,
and I was looking
for ways to tell a story.
And I ran across Gordon Parks' book
"A Choice of Weapons,"
which was his autobiography.
I began photographing and making images,
and I tucked away that contact sheet
that I made of my pregnant belly,
and then you inspired me
to create a new piece,
a piece that said, "A woman
taking a place from a good man,"
"You took the space from a good man,"
and then I used that language
and reversed it and said,
"I made a space for a good man, you."
(Applause)
HWT: Thanks, ma.
Like mother, like son.
I grew up in a house full of photographs.
They were everywhere, and my mother
would turn the kitchen into a darkroom.
And there weren't
just pictures that she took
and pictures of family members.
But there were pictures on the wall
of and by people that we didn't know,
men and women that we didn't know.
Thanks, ma.
(Laughter)
I have my own timing.
(Laughter)
Did you see her poke me?
(Laughter)
Puppet strings.
I grew up in a house full of photographs.
(Applause)
But they weren't just pictures
of men and women that we knew,
but pictures of people that I didn't know,
Pretty much, it was pretty clear
from what I learned in school,
that the rest of the world didn't either.
And it took me a long time
to figure out what she was up to,
but after a while, I figured it out.
When I was nine years old,
she published this book,
"Black Photographers, 1840-1940:
A Bio-Bibliography."
And it's astounding to me to consider
that in 1840, African Americans
were making photographs.
What does it mean for us to think
that at a time that was two, three decades
before the end of slavery,
that people were learning how to read,
they had to learn how to do math,
they had to be on the cutting edge
of science and technology,
to do math, physics and chemistry
just to make a single photograph.
And what compelled them
to do that if not love?
Well, that book led her to her next book,
"Black Photographers, 1940-1988,"
and that book led to another book,
and another book, and another book,
and another book, and another book,
and another book, and another book,
and another book, and another book,
and another book, and another book,
and another book, and another book,
and another book, and another book,
and another book,
and another book, and another.
(Applause)
And throughout my life,
she's edited and published dozens of books
and curated numerous exhibitions
on every continent,
not all about black photographers
but all inspired by the curiosity
of a little black girl
from North Philadelphia.
DW: What I found is that
black photographers had stories to tell,
and we needed to listen.
And then I found and I discovered
black photographers
like Augustus Washington,
who made these beautiful daguerreotypes
of the McGill family
in the early 1840s and '50s.
Their stories tended to be different,
black photographers,
and they had a different narrative
about black life during slavery,
but it was also about family life, beauty
and telling stories about community.
I didn't know how to link the stories,
but I knew that teachers
needed to know this story.
HWT: So I think I was
my mother's first student.
Unwillingly and unwittingly --
puppet strings --
I decided to pick up a camera,
and thought that I
should make my own pictures
about the then and now
and the now and then.
I thought about
how I could use photography
to talk about how what's going on
outside of the frame of the camera
can affect what we see inside.
The truth is always in the hands
of the actual image maker
and it's up to us to really consider
what's being cut out.
I thought I could use her research
as a jumping-off point
of things that I was seeing in society
and I wanted to start to think
about how I could use historical images
to talk about the past being present
and think about ways that we can speak
to the perennial struggle
for human rights and equal rights
through my appropriation of photographs
in the form of sculpture, video,
installation and paintings.
But through it all,
one piece has affected me the most.
It continues to nourish me.
It's based off of this photograph
by Ernest Withers,
who took this picture in 1968
at the Memphis Sanitation Workers March
of men and women standing collectively
to affirm their humanity.
They were holding signs
that said "I am a man,"
and I found that astounding,
because the phrase I grew up with
wasn't "I am a man,"
it was "I am the man,"
and I was amazed at how it went from this
collective statement during segregation
to this seemingly selfish statement
after integration.
And I wanted to ponder that,
so I decided to remix that text
in as many ways as I could think of,
and I like to think of the top line
as a timeline of American history,
and the last line as a poem,
and it says,
"I am the man. Who's the man.
You the man. What a man.
I am man. I am many. I am, am I.
I am, I am. I am, Amen.
DW: Wow, so fascinating.
(Applause)
But what we learn from this experience
is the most powerful two words
in the English language is, "I am."
And we each have the capacity to love.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Hi. My name is Marwa,
and I'm an architect.
I was born and raised in Homs,
a city in the central
western part of Syria,
and I've always lived here.
After six years of war,
Homs is now a half-destroyed city.
My family and I were lucky;
our place is still standing.
Although for two years,
we were like prisoners at home.
Outside there were demonstrations
and battles and bombings and snipers.
My husband and I used to run
an architecture studio
in the old town main square.
It's gone, as is most
of the old town itself.
Half of the city's other neighborhoods
are now rubble.
Since the ceasefire in late 2015,
large parts of Homs
have been more or less quiet.
The economy is completely broken,
and people are still fighting.
The merchants who had stalls
in the old city market
now trade out of sheds on the streets.
Under our apartment, there is a carpenter,
sweetshops, a butcher, a printing house,
workshops, among many more.
I have started teaching part-time,
and with my husband,
who juggles several jobs,
we've opened a small bookshop.
Other people do all sorts
of jobs to get by.
When I look at my destroyed city,
of course, I ask myself:
What has led to this senseless war?
Syria was largely a place of tolerance,
historically accustomed to variety,
accommodating a wide range
of beliefs, origins, customs,
goods, food.
How did my country --
a country with communities
living harmoniously together
and comfortable in discussing
their differences --
how did it degenerate into civil war,
violence, displacement
and unprecedented sectarian hatred?
There were many reasons
that had led to the war --
social, political and economic.
They all have played their role.
But I believe there is one key reason
that has been overlooked
and which is important to analyze,
because from it will largely depend
whether we can make sure
that this doesn't happen again.
And that reason is architecture.
Architecture in my country
has played an important role
in creating, directing and amplifying
conflict between warring factions,
and this is probably true
for other countries as well.
There is a sure correspondence
between the architecture of a place
and the character of the community
that has settled there.
Architecture plays a key role
in whether a community crumbles
or comes together.
Syrian society has long lived
the coexistence
of different traditions and backgrounds.
Syrians have experienced
the prosperity of open trade
and sustainable communities.
They have enjoyed the true meaning
of belonging to a place,
and that was reflected
in their built environment,
in the mosques and churches
built back-to-back,
in the interwoven souks and public venues,
and the proportions and sizes based
on principles of humanity and harmony.
This architecture of mixity
can still be read in the remains.
The old Islamic city in Syria
was built over a multilayered past,
integrating with it
and embracing its spirit.
So did its communities.
People lived and worked with each other
in a place that gave them
a sense of belonging
and made them feel at home.
They shared a remarkably
unified existence.
But over the last century,
gradually this delicate balance
of these places has been interfered with;
first, by the urban planners
of the colonial period,
when the French went
enthusiastically about,
transforming what they saw
as the un-modern Syrian cities.
They blew up city streets
and relocated monuments.
They called them improvements,
and they were the beginning
of a long, slow unraveling.
The traditional urbanism
and architecture of our cities
assured identity and belonging
not by separation,
but by intertwining.
But over time, the ancient became
worthless, and the new, coveted.
The harmony of the built environment
and social environment
got trampled over
by elements of modernity --
brutal, unfinished concrete blocks,
neglect, aesthetic devastation,
divisive urbanism that zoned
communities by class, creed or affluence.
And the same was happening
to the community.
As the shape of the built
environment changed,
so the lifestyles and sense
of belonging of the communities
also started changing.
From a register
of togetherness, of belonging,
architecture became
a way of differentiation,
and communities started drifting apart
from the very fabric
that used to unite them,
and from the soul of the place that used
to represent their common existence.
While many reasons had led
to the Syrian war,
we shouldn't underestimate
the way in which,
by contributing to the loss 
of identity and self-respect,
urban zoning and misguided,
inhumane architecture
have nurtured sectarian
divisions and hatred.
Over time, the united city
has morphed into a city center
with ghettos along its circumference.
And in turn, the coherent communities
became distinct social groups,
alienated from each other
and alienated from the place.
From my point of view,
losing the sense of belonging to a place
and a sense of sharing it
with someone else
has made it a lot easier to destroy.
The clear example can be seen
in the informal housing system,
which used to host, before the war,
over 40 percent of the population.
Yes, prior to the war,
almost half of the Syrian population
lived in slums,
peripheral areas
without proper infrastructure,
made of endless rows of bare block boxes
containing people,
people who mostly belonged
to the same group,
whether based on religion,
class, origin or all of the above.
This ghettoized urbanism
proved to be a tangible precursor of war.
Conflict is much easier
between pre-categorized areas --
where the "others" live.
The ties that used
to bind the city together --
whether they were social,
through coherent building,
or economic, through trade in the souk,
or religious, through
the coexistent presence --
were all lost in the misguided
and visionless modernization
of the built environment.
Allow me an aside.
When I read about heterogeneous urbanism
in other parts of the world,
involving ethnic neighborhoods
in British cities
or around Paris or Brussels,
I recognize the beginning
of the kind of instability
we have witnessed
so disastrously here in Syria.
We have severely destroyed cities,
such as Homs, Aleppo,
Daraa and many others,
and almost half of the population
of the country is now displaced.
Hopefully, the war will end,
and the question that,
as an architect, I have to ask, is:
How do we rebuild?
What are the principles
that we should adopt
in order to avoid repeating
the same mistakes?
From my point of view, the main focus
should be on creating places
that make their people feel they belong.
Architecture and planning
need to recapture
some of the traditional values
that did just that,
creating the conditions
for coexistence and peace,
values of beauty
that don't exhibit ostentation,
but rather, approachability and ease,
moral values that promote
generosity and acceptance,
architecture that is for everyone
to enjoy, not just for the elite,
just as used to be in the shadowed alleys
of the old Islamic city,
mixed designs that encourage
a sense of community.
There is a neighborhood here in Homs
that's called Baba Amr
that has been fully destroyed.
Almost two years ago,
I introduced this design
into a UN-Habitat competition
for rebuilding it.
The idea was to create an urban fabric
inspired by a tree,
capable of growing
and spreading organically,
echoing the traditional bridge
hanging over the old alleys,
and incorporating apartments,
private courtyards, shops,
workshops, places for parking
and playing and leisure,
trees and shaded areas.
It's far from perfect, obviously.
I drew it during the few hours
of electricity we get.
And there are many possible ways
to express belonging and community
through architecture.
But compare it with the freestanding,
disconnected blocks
proposed by the official project
for rebuilding Baba Amr.
Architecture is not the axis
around which all human life rotates,
but it has the power to suggest
and even direct human activity.
In that sense, settlement,
identity and social integration
are all the producer and product
of effective urbanism.
The coherent urbanism
of the old Islamic city
and of many old European
towns, for instance,
promote integration,
while rows of soulless housing
or tower blocks,
even when they are luxurious,
tend to promote isolation and "otherness."
Even simple things
like shaded places or fruit plants
or drinking water inside the city
can make a difference
in how people feel towards the place,
and whether they consider it
a generous place that gives,
a place that's worth keeping,
contributing to,
or whether they see it
as an alienating place,
full of seeds of anger.
In order for a place to give,
its architecture should be giving, too.
Our built environment matters.
The fabric of our cities is reflected
in the fabric of our souls.
And whether in the shape
of informal concrete slums
or broken social housing
or trampled old towns
or forests of skyscrapers,
the contemporary urban archetypes
that have emerged
all across the Middle East
have been one cause of the alienation
and fragmentation of our communities.
We can learn from this.
We can learn how to rebuild
in another way,
how to create an architecture
that doesn't contribute only
to the practical and economic
aspects of people's lives,
but also to their social, spiritual
and psychological needs.
Those needs were totally overlooked
in the Syrian cities before the war.
We need to create again
cities that are shared
by the communities that inhabit them.
If we do so, people will not feel the need
to seek identities opposed
to the other identities all around,
because they will all feel at home.
Thank you for listening.
This is a painting from the 16th century
from Lucas Cranach the Elder.
It shows the famous Fountain of Youth.
If you drink its water or you bathe in it,
you will get health and youth.
Every culture, every civilization
has dreamed of finding eternal youth.
There are people like Alexander the Great
or Ponce De León, the explorer,
who spent much of their life
chasing the Fountain of Youth.
They didn't find it.
But what if there was something to it?
What if there was something
to this Fountain of Youth?
I will share an absolutely amazing
development in aging research
that could revolutionize
the way we think about aging
and how we may treat age-related
diseases in the future.
It started with experiments that showed,
in a recent number
of studies about growing,
that animals -- old mice --
that share a blood supply with young mice
can get rejuvenated.
This is similar to what you might see
in humans, in Siamese twins,
and I know this sounds a bit creepy.
But what Tom Rando, a stem-cell
researcher, reported in 2007,
was that old muscle from a mouse
can be rejuvenated
if it's exposed to young blood
through common circulation.
This was reproduced by Amy Wagers
at Harvard a few years later,
and others then showed that similar
rejuvenating effects could be observed
in the pancreas, the liver and the heart.
But what I'm most excited about,
and several other labs as well,
is that this may even apply to the brain.
So, what we found is that an old mouse
exposed to a young environment
in this model called parabiosis,
shows a younger brain --
and a brain that functions better.
And I repeat:
an old mouse that gets young blood
through shared circulation
looks younger and functions
younger in its brain.
So when we get older --
we can look at different aspects
of human cognition,
and you can see on this slide here,
we can look at reasoning,
verbal ability and so forth.
And up to around age 50 or 60,
these functions are all intact,
and as I look at the young audience
here in the room, we're all still fine.
(Laughter)
But it's scary to see
how all these curves go south.
And as we get older,
diseases such as Alzheimer's
and others may develop.
We know that with age,
the connections between neurons --
the way neurons talk to each other,
the synapses -- they start to deteriorate;
neurons die, the brain starts to shrink,
and there's an increased susceptibility
for these neurodegenerative diseases.
One big problem we have -- to try
to understand how this really works
at a very molecular mechanistic level --
is that we can't study the brains
in detail, in living people.
We can do cognitive tests,
we can do imaging --
all kinds of sophisticated testing.
But we usually have to wait
until the person dies
to get the brain and look at how it really
changed through age or in a disease.
This is what neuropathologists
do, for example.
So, how about we think of the brain
as being part of the larger organism.
Could we potentially understand more
about what happens in the brain
at the molecular level
if we see the brain
as part of the entire body?
So if the body ages or gets sick,
does that affect the brain?
And vice versa: as the brain gets older,
does that influence the rest of the body?
And what connects all the different
tissues in the body
is blood.
Blood is the tissue that not only carries
cells that transport oxygen, for example,
the red blood cells,
or fights infectious diseases,
but it also carries messenger molecules,
hormone-like factors
that transport information
from one cell to another,
from one tissue to another,
including the brain.
So if we look at how the blood
changes in disease or age,
can we learn something about the brain?
We know that as we get older,
the blood changes as well,
so these hormone-like factors
change as we get older.
And by and large,
factors that we know are required
for the development of tissues,
for the maintenance of tissues --
they start to decrease as we get older,
while factors involved in repair,
in injury and in inflammation --
they increase as we get older.
So there's this unbalance of good
and bad factors, if you will.
And to illustrate what we can do
potentially with that,
I want to talk you through
an experiment that we did.
We had almost 300 blood samples
from healthy human beings
20 to 89 years of age,
and we measured over 100
of these communication factors,
these hormone-like proteins that
transport information between tissues.
And what we noticed first
is that between the youngest
and the oldest group,
about half the factors
changed significantly.
So our body lives in a very
different environment as we get older,
when it comes to these factors.
And using statistical
or bioinformatics programs,
we could try to discover
those factors that best predict age --
in a way, back-calculate
the relative age of a person.
And the way this looks
is shown in this graph.
So, on the one axis you see
the actual age a person lived,
the chronological age.
So, how many years they lived.
And then we take these top factors
that I showed you,
and we calculate their relative age,
their biological age.
And what you see is that
there is a pretty good correlation,
so we can pretty well predict
the relative age of a person.
But what's really exciting
are the outliers,
as they so often are in life.
You can see here, the person
I highlighted with the green dot
is about 70 years of age
but seems to have a biological age,
if what we're doing here is really true,
of only about 45.
So is this a person that actually
looks much younger than their age?
But more importantly: Is this a person
who is maybe at a reduced risk
to develop an age-related disease
and will have a long life --
will live to 100 or more?
On the other hand, the person here,
highlighted with the red dot,
is not even 40,
but has a biological age of 65.
Is this a person at an increased risk
of developing an age-related disease?
So in our lab, we're trying
to understand these factors better,
and many other groups
are trying to understand,
what are the true aging factors,
and can we learn something about them
to possibly predict age-related diseases?
So what I've shown you so far
is simply correlational, right?
You can just say,
"Well, these factors change with age,"
but you don't really know
if they do something about aging.
So what I'm going to show you now
is very remarkable
and it suggests that these factors
can actually modulate the age of a tissue.
And that's where we come back
to this model called parabiosis.
So, parabiosis is done in mice
by surgically connecting
the two mice together,
and that leads then
to a shared blood system,
where we can now ask,
"How does the old brain get influenced
by exposure to the young blood?"
And for this purpose, we use young mice
that are an equivalency
of 20-year-old people,
and old mice that are roughly
65 years old in human years.
What we found is quite remarkable.
We find there are more neural stem cells
that make new neurons
in these old brains.
There's an increased
activity of the synapses,
the connections between neurons.
There are more genes expressed
that are known to be involved
in the formation of new memories.
And there's less of this bad inflammation.
But we observed that there are no cells
entering the brains of these animals.
So when we connect them,
there are actually no cells
going into the old brain, in this model.
Instead, we've reasoned, then,
that it must be the soluble factors,
so we could collect simply the soluble
fraction of blood which is called plasma,
and inject either young plasma
or old plasma into these mice,
and we could reproduce
these rejuvenating effects,
but what we could also do now
is we could do memory tests with mice.
As mice get older, like us humans,
they have memory problems.
It's just harder to detect them,
but I'll show you in a minute
how we do that.
But we wanted to take this
one step further,
one step closer to potentially
being relevant to humans.
What I'm showing you now
are unpublished studies,
where we used human plasma,
young human plasma,
and as a control, saline,
and injected it into old mice,
and asked, can we again
rejuvenate these old mice?
Can we make them smarter?
And to do this, we used a test.
It's called a Barnes maze.
This is a big table
that has lots of holes in it,
and there are guide marks around it,
and there's a bright light,
as on this stage here.
The mice hate this and they try to escape,
and find the single hole that you see
pointed at with an arrow,
where a tube is mounted underneath
where they can escape
and feel comfortable in a dark hole.
So we teach them, over several days,
to find this space
on these cues in the space,
and you can compare this for humans,
to finding your car in a parking lot
after a busy day of shopping.
(Laughter)
Many of us have probably had
some problems with that.
So, let's look at an old mouse here.
This is an old mouse
that has memory problems,
as you'll notice in a moment.
It just looks into every hole,
but it didn't form this spacial map
that would remind it where it was
in the previous trial or the last day.
In stark contrast, this mouse here
is a sibling of the same age,
but it was treated with young
human plasma for three weeks,
with small injections every three days.
And as you noticed, it almost
looks around, "Where am I?" --
and then walks straight
to that hole and escapes.
So, it could remember where that hole was.
So by all means, this old mouse
seems to be rejuvenated --
it functions more like a younger mouse.
And it also suggests
that there is something
not only in young mouse plasma,
but in young human plasma
that has the capacity
to help this old brain.
So to summarize,
we find the old mouse, and its brain
in particular, are malleable.
They're not set in stone;
we can actually change them.
It can be rejuvenated.
Young blood factors can reverse aging,
and what I didn't show you --
in this model, the young mouse actually
suffers from exposure to the old.
So there are old-blood factors
that can accelerate aging.
And most importantly,
humans may have similar factors,
because we can take young human
blood and have a similar effect.
Old human blood, I didn't show you,
does not have this effect;
it does not make the mice younger.
So, is this magic transferable to humans?
We're running a small
clinical study at Stanford,
where we treat Alzheimer's patients
with mild disease
with a pint of plasma
from young volunteers, 20-year-olds,
and do this once a week for four weeks,
and then we look
at their brains with imaging.
We test them cognitively,
and we ask their caregivers
for daily activities of living.
What we hope is that there are
some signs of improvement
from this treatment.
And if that's the case,
that could give us hope
that what I showed you works in mice
might also work in humans.
Now, I don't think we will live forever.
But maybe we discovered
that the Fountain of Youth
is actually within us,
and it has just dried out.
And if we can turn it
back on a little bit,
maybe we can find the factors
that are mediating these effects,
we can produce these factors synthetically
and we can treat diseases of aging,
such as Alzheimer's disease
or other dementias.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
I have a two-year-old daughter named Naya
who is under the mistaken impression
that this conference
is named in honor of her father.
(Laughter)
Who am I to contradict my baby girl?
As many of you know, there's something
about becoming a parent
that concentrates the mind
on long-term problems like climate change.
It was the birth of my daughter
that inspired me
to launch this climate organization,
in order to counteract the excessive
polarization of this issue
in the United States,
and to find a conservative
pathway forward.
Yes, folks, a Republican
climate solution is possible,
and you know what?
It may even be better.
(Laughter)
Let me try to prove that to you.
What we really need
is a killer app to climate policy.
In the technology world, a killer app
is an application so transformative
that it creates its own market,
like Uber.
In the climate world,
a killer app is a new
solution so promising
that it can break through
the seemingly insurmountable
barriers to progress.
These include the psychological barrier.
Climate advocates have long
been encouraging their fellow citizens
to make short-term sacrifices now
for benefits that accrue to other people
in other countries 30 or 40
years in the future.
It just doesn't fly because it runs
contrary to basic human nature.
Next is the geopolitical barrier.
Under the current rules of global trade,
countries have a strong incentive
to free ride off the emissions reductions
of other nations,
instead of strengthening
their own programs.
This has been the curse
of every international
climate negotiations, including Paris.
Finally, we have the partisan barrier.
Even the most committed countries --
Germany, the United Kingdom, Canada --
are nowhere near reducing emissions
at the required scale and speed.
Not even close.
And the partisan climate divide
is far more acute
here in the United States.
We are fundamentally stuck,
and that is why we need
a killer app of climate policy
to break through each of these barriers.
I'm convinced that the road
to climate progress in the United States
runs through the Republican Party
and the business community.
So in launching
the Climate Leadership Council,
I started by reaching out to a who's who
of Republican elder statesmen
and business leaders,
including James Baker and George Schultz,
the two most respected Republican
elder statesmen in America;
Martin Feldstein and Greg Mankiw,
the two most respected
conservative economists in the country;
and Henry Paulson and Rob Walton,
two of the most successful
and admired business leaders.
Together, we co-authored
"The Conservative Case
For Carbon Dividends."
This represents the first time
that Republican leaders put forth
a concrete market-based climate solution.
(Applause)
Thank you.
(Applause)
We presented our plan at the White House
two weeks after President Trump moved in.
Almost every leading
editorial board in the country
has since endorsed our plan,
and Fortune 100 companies
from a wide range of industries
are now getting behind it.
So by now you're probably wondering,
what exactly is this plan?
Well, our carbon dividends solution
is based on four pillars.
The first is a gradually
rising carbon tax.
Although capitalism is a wonderful system,
like many operating systems,
it's prone to bugs,
which, in this case, are called
"market failures."
By far the largest is that
market prices fail to take
social and environmental
costs into account.
That means every market transaction
is based on incorrect information.
This fundamental bug of capitalism,
more than any other single factor,
is to blame for our climate predicament.
Now in theory, this should be
an easy problem to fix.
Economists agree
that the best solution is to put a price
on the carbon content of fossil fuels,
otherwise known as a carbon tax.
This would discourage carbon emissions
in every single economic transaction,
every day of the year.
However, a carbon tax by itself
has proven to be unpopular
and a political dead end.
The answer is to return
all the money raised
directly to citizens,
in the form of equal monthly dividends.
This would transform
an unpopular carbon tax
into a popular and populist solution,
and it would also solve
the underlying psychological barrier
that we discussed,
by giving everyone a concrete benefit
in the here and now.
And these benefits would be significant.
Assuming a carbon tax rate
that starts at 40 dollars per ton,
a family of four would receive
2,000 dollars per year
from the get-go.
According to the US Treasury Department,
the bottom 70 percent of Americans
would receive more in dividends
than they would pay
in increased energy prices.
That means 223 million Americans
would win economically
from solving climate change.
And that --
(Applause)
is revolutionary,
and could fundamentally
alter climate politics.
But there's another
revolutionary element here.
The amount of the dividend would grow
as the carbon tax rate increases.
The more we protect our climate,
the more our citizens benefit.
This creates a positive feedback loop,
which is crucial,
because the only way we will reach
our long-term emission-reduction goals
is if the carbon tax rate
goes up every year.
The third pillar of our program
is eliminating regulations
that are no longer needed
once a carbon dividends plan is enacted.
This is a key selling point
to Republicans and business leaders.
So why should we trade
climate regulations for a price on carbon?
Well, let me show you.
Our plan would achieve nearly twice
the emissions reductions
of all Obama-era climate
regulations combined,
and nearly three times the new baseline
after President Trump repeals
all of those regulations.
That assumes a carbon tax
starting at 40 dollars per ton,
which translates into roughly
an extra 36 cents per gallon of gas.
Our plan by itself
would meet the high end
of America's commitment
under the Paris Climate Agreement,
and as you can see,
the emissions reductions
would continue over time.
This illustrates the power
of a conservative climate solution
based on free markets
and limited government.
We would end up with less regulation
and far less pollution at the same time,
while helping working-class
Americans get ahead.
Doesn't that sound like something
we could all support?
(Applause)
The fourth and final pillar of our program
is a new climate domino effect,
based on border carbon adjustments.
Now that may sound complicated,
but it, too, is revolutionary,
because it provides us
a whole new strategy
to reach a global price on carbon,
which is ultimately what we need.
Let me show you an example.
Suppose Country A adopts
a carbon dividends plan,
and Country B does not.
Well, to level the playing field
and protect the competitiveness
of its industries,
Country A would tax imports from Country B
based on their carbon content.
Fair enough.
But here's where it gets
really interesting,
because the money raised at the border
would increase the dividends
going to the citizens of Country A.
Well, how long do you think it would take
the public in Country B to realize
that that money should be going to them,
and to push for a carbon
dividends plan in their own land?
Add a few more countries,
and we get a new climate domino effect.
Once one major country or region
adopts carbon dividends
with border carbon adjustments,
other countries are compelled
to follow suit.
One by one the dominoes fall.
And this domino effect
could start anywhere.
My preference, strongly,
is the United States,
but it could also start
in the United Kingdom,
in Germany or another European country,
or even in China.
Let's take China as an example.
China is committed to reducing
greenhouse gas emissions,
but what its leaders care even more about
is transitioning their economy
to consumer-led economic development.
Well, nothing could do more
to hasten that transition
than giving every Chinese citizen
a monthly dividend.
In fact, this is the only policy solution
that would enable China to meet
its environmental and economic goals
at the same time.
That's why this is the killer app
of climate policy,
because it would enable us to overcome
each of the barriers we discussed earlier:
the psychological barrier,
the partisan barrier,
and, as we've just seen,
the geopolitical barrier.
All we need is a country to lead the way.
And one method of finding
what you're looking for
is to take out an ad.
So let's read this one together.
Wanted: country to pioneer
carbon dividends plan.
Cost to country: zero.
Starting date: as soon as possible.
Advantages: most effective
climate solution,
popular and populist,
pro-growth and pro-business,
shrinks government
and helps the working class.
Additional compensation: gratitude
of current and future generations,
including my daughter.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Chris Anderson: Just one
question for you, Ted.
I'm actually not sure
I've seen a conservative
get a standing O at TED before that.
That's pretty cool.
The logic seems really powerful,
but some people you talk to in politics
say it's hard to imagine this
still getting through Congress.
How are you feeling
about momentum behind this?
Ted Halstead: So I understand
that many are very pessimistic
about what's happening in
the United States with President Trump.
I'm less pessimistic; here's why.
The actions of this White House,
the early actions on climate,
are just the first move
in a complex game of climate chess.
So far it's been a repeal-only strategy;
the pressure is going to mount 
for a replacement program,
which is where we come in.
And there are three reasons why,
which I'll go through real quickly.
One, the business community
is fundamentally parting ways
with the White House on climate change.
In fact, we're finding
a number of Fortune 100 companies
supporting our program.
Within two months,
we're going to be announcing
some really surprising names
coming out in favor of this program.
Two, there is no issue
in American politics
where there's a more fundamental gap
between the Republican base
and the Republican leadership
than climate change.
And three, thinking of
this analogy of chess,
the big decision up ahead is:
Does the administration stay in Paris?
Well, let's pan it out both ways.
If it stays in Paris, as many
are pushing for in the administration,
well then that begs a question:
What's the plan?
We have the plan.
But if they don't stay in Paris,
the international pressure
will be overwhelming.
Our Secretary of State will be asking
other countries for NATO contributions,
and they'll be saying,
"No, give us our Paris commitment.
Come through on your commitments,
we'll come through on ours."
So, international, business
and even the Republican base
will all be calling for
a Republican replacement plan.
And, hopefully, we've provided one.
CA: Thank you so much, Ted.
TH: Thank you, Chris.
(Applause)
Today I am going to teach you
how to play my favorite game:
massively multiplayer thumb-wrestling.
It's the only game in the world that I know of
that allows you, the player,
the opportunity to experience
10 positive emotions in 60 seconds or less.
This is true, so if you play this game with me today
for just one single minute,
you will get to feel joy, relief, love, surprise,
pride, curiosity, excitement, awe and wonder,
contentment, and creativity,
all in the span of one minute.
So this sounds pretty good, right?
Now you're willing to play.
In order to teach you this game,
I'm going to need some volunteers
to come up onstage really quickly,
and we're going to do a little hands-on demo.
While they're coming up, I should let you know,
this game was invented 10 years ago
by an artists' collective in Austria named Monochrom.
So thank you, Monochrom.
Okay, so most people are familiar
with traditional, two-person thumb-wrestling.
Sunni, let's just remind them.
One, two, three, four, 
I declare a thumb war, and we wrestle,
and of course Sunni beats me
because she's the best.
Now the first thing about
massively multiplayer thumb-wrestling,
we're the gamer generation.
There are a billion gamers on the planet now,
so we need more of a challenge.
So the first thing we need is more thumbs.
So Eric, come on over.
So we could get three thumbs together,
and Peter could join us.
We could even have four thumbs together,
and the way you win
is you're the first person
to pin someone else's thumb.
This is really important. You can't, like,
wait while they fight it out and
then swoop in at the last minute.
That is not how you win.
Ah, who did that? Eric you did that.
So Eric would have won. He was
the first person to pin my thumb.
Okay, so that's the first rule,
and we can see that three or four
is kind of the typical number of thumbs in a node,
but if you feel ambitious,
you don't have to hold back.
We can really go for it.
So you can see up here.
Now the only other rule you need to remember is,
gamer generation, we like a challenge.
I happen to notice you all have
some thumbs you're not using.
So I think we should kind of get some more involved.
And if we had just four people,
we would do it just like this,
and we would try and wrestle
both thumbs at the same time.
Perfect.
Now, if we had more people in the room,
instead of just wrestling in a closed node,
we might reach out and try
and grab some other people.
And in fact, that's what we're going to do right now.
We're going to try and get all, something like,
I don't know, 1,500 thumbs in this room
connected in a single node.
And we have to connect both levels,
so if you're up there, you're going to be
reaching down and reaching up.
Now — (Laughter) —
before we get started --
This is great. You're excited to play. —
before we get started, can I have
the slides back up here really quick,
because if you get good at this game,
I want you to know there are some advanced levels.
So this is the kind of simple level, right?
But there are advanced configurations.
This is called the Death Star Configuration.
Any Star Wars fans?
And this one's called the Möbius Strip.
Any science geeks, you get that one.
This is the hardest level. This is the extreme.
So we'll stick with the normal one for now,
and I'm going to give you 30 seconds,
every thumb into the node,
connect the upper and the lower levels,
you guys go on down there.
Thirty seconds. Into the network. Make the node.
Stand up! It's easier if you stand up.
Everybody, up up up up up!
Stand up, my friends.
All right.
Don't start wrestling yet.
If you have a free thumb, wave it around,
make sure it gets connected.
Okay. We need to do a last-minute thumb check.
If you have a free thumb,
wave it around to make sure.
Grab that thumb!
Reach behind you. There you go.
Any other thumbs?
Okay, on the count of three, you're going to go.
Try to keep track. Grab, grab, grab it.
Okay? One, two, three, go!
(Laughter)
Did you win? You got it? You got it? Excellent!
(Applause)
Well done. Thank you. Thank you very much.
All right.
While you are basking in the glow
of having won your first
massively multiplayer thumb-wrestling game,
let's do a quick recap on the positive emotions.
So curiosity.
I said "massively multiplayer thumb-wrestling."
You were like, "What the hell is she talking about?"
So I provoked a little curiosity.
Creativity: it took creativity to solve the problem
of getting all the thumbs into the node.
I'm reaching around and I'm reaching up.
So you used creativity. That was great.
How about surprise? The actual feeling
of trying to wrestle two thumbs at once
is pretty surprising.
You heard that sound go up in the room.
We had excitement. As you started to wrestle,
maybe you're starting to win
or this person's, like, really into it,
so you kind of get the excitement going.
We have relief. You got to stand up.
You've been sitting for awhile, so the physical relief,
getting to shake it out.
We had joy. You were laughing, smiling.
Look at your faces. This room is full of joy.
We had some contentment.
I didn't see anybody sending text messages
or checking their email while we were playing,
so you were totally content to be playing.
The most important three emotions,
awe and wonder, we had everybody
connected physically for a minute.
When was the last time you were at TED
and you got to connect physically
with every single person in the room?
And it's truly awesome and wondrous.
And speaking of physical connection,
you guys know I love the hormone oxytocin,
you release oxytocin, you feel bonded
to everyone in the room.
You guys know that the best way
to release oxytocin quickly
is to hold someone else's hand
for at least six seconds.
You guys were all holding hands
for way more than six seconds,
so we are all now biochemically primed
to love each other. That is great.
And the last emotion of pride.
How many people are like me. Just admit it.
You lost both your thumbs.
It just didn't work out for you.
That's okay, because you learned a new skill today.
You learned, from scratch,
a game you never knew before.
Now you know how to play it.
You can teach other people.
So congratulations.
How many of you won just won thumb?
All right. I have very good news for you.
According to the official rules
of massively multiplayer thumb-wrestling,
this makes you a grandmaster of the game.
Because there aren't that many
people who know how to play,
we have to kind of accelerate the program
more than a game like chess.
So congratulations, grandmasters.
Win one thumb once, you will
become a grandmaster.
Did anybody win both their thumbs?
Yes. Awesome. Okay.
Get ready to update your Twitter or Facebook status.
You guys, according to the rules,
are legendary grandmasters, so congratulations.
I will just leave you with this tip,
if you want to play again.
The best way to become a legendary grandmaster,
you've got your two nodes going on.
Pick off the one that looks easiest.
They're not paying attention. They look kind of weak.
Focus on that one and do something crazy
with this arm.
As soon as you win, suddenly stop.
Everybody is thrown off. You go in for the kill.
That's how you become a legendary grandmaster
of massively multiplayer thumb-wrestling.
Thank you for letting me
teach you my favorite game.
Wooo! (Applause)
Thank you. (Applause)
I want to share with you
something my father taught me:
no condition is permanent.
It's a lesson he shared with me
again and again,
and I learned it to be true the hard way.
Here I am in my fourth-grade class.
This is my yearbook picture
taken in my class in school
in Monrovia, Liberia.
My parents migrated from India
to West Africa in the 1970s,
and I had the privilege
of growing up there.
I was nine years old,
I loved kicking around a soccer ball,
and I was a total math and science geek.
I was living the kind of life
that, really, any child would dream of.
But no condition is permanent.
On Christmas Eve in 1989,
civil war erupted in Liberia.
The war started in the rural countryside,
and within months, rebel armies
had marched towards our hometown.
My school shut down,
and when the rebel armies captured
the only international airport,
people started panicking and fleeing.
My mom came knocking one morning
and said, "Raj, pack your things --
we have to go."
We were rushed to the center of town,
and there on a tarmac,
we were split into two lines.
I stood with my family in one line,
and we were stuffed into the cargo hatch
of a rescue plane.
And there on a bench,
I was sitting with my heart racing.
As I looked out the open hatch,
I saw hundreds of Liberians
in another line,
children strapped to their backs.
When they tried to jump in with us,
I watched soldiers restrain them.
They were not allowed to flee.
We were the lucky ones.
We lost what we had,
but we resettled in America,
and as immigrants, we benefitted
from the community of supporters
that rallied around us.
They took my family into their home,
they mentored me.
And they helped my dad
start a clothing shop.
I'd visit my father
on weekends as a teenager
to help him sell sneakers and jeans.
And every time business would get bad,
he'd remind me of that mantra:
no condition is permanent.
That mantra and my parents' persistence
and that community of supporters
made it possible for me
to go through college
and eventually to medical school.
I'd once had my hopes crushed in a war,
but because of them,
I had a chance to pursue my dream
to become a doctor.
My condition had changed.
It had been 15 years
since I escaped that airfield,
but the memory of those two lines
had not escaped my mind.
I was a medical student in my mid-20s,
and I wanted to go back
to see if I could serve
the people we'd left behind.
But when I got back,
what I found was utter destruction.
The war had left us with just 51 doctors
to serve a country of four million people.
It would be like the city of San Francisco
having just 10 doctors.
So if you got sick in the city
where those few doctors remain,
you might stand a chance.
But if you got sick in the remote,
rural rainforest communities,
where you could be days
from the nearest clinic --
I was seeing my patients die
from conditions no one should die from,
all because they were
getting to me too late.
Imagine you have a two-year-old
who wakes up one morning with a fever,
and you realize she could have malaria,
and you know the only way to get her
the medicine she needs
would be to take her to the riverbed,
get in a canoe, paddle to the other side
and then walk for up to two days
through the forest
just to reach the nearest clinic.
One billion people live
in the world's most remote communities,
and despite the advances we've made
in modern medicine and technology,
our innovations are not
reaching the last mile.
These communities have been left behind,
because they've been thought
too hard to reach
and too difficult to serve.
Illness is universal;
access to care is not.
And realizing this lit a fire in my soul.
No one should die because they live
too far from a doctor or clinic.
No condition should be permanent.
And help in this case
didn't come from the outside,
it actually came from within.
It came from the communities themselves.
Meet Musu.
Way out in rural Liberia,
where most girls have not had
a chance to finish primary school,
Musu had been persistent.
At the age of 18,
she completed high school,
and she came back to her community.
She saw that none of the children
were getting treatment
for the diseases
they needed treatment for --
deadly diseases, like malaria
and pneumonia.
So she signed up to be a volunteer.
There are millions of volunteers like Musu
in rural parts around our world,
and we got to thinking --
community members like Musu
could actually help us solve a puzzle.
Our health care system
is structured in such a way
that the work of diagnosing disease
and prescribing medicines
is limited to a team of nurses
and doctors like me.
But nurses and doctors
are concentrated in cities,
so rural communities like Musu's
have been left behind.
So we started asking some questions:
What if we could reorganize
the medical care system?
What if we could have community
members like Musu
be a part or even be the center
of our medical team?
What if Musu could help us bring
health care from clinics in cities
to the doorsteps of her neighbors?
Musu was 48 when I met her.
And despite her amazing talent and grit,
she hadn't had a paying job in 30 years.
So what if technology could support her?
What if we could invest in her
with real training,
equip her with real medicines,
and have her have a real job?
Well, in 2007, I was trying
to answer these questions,
and my wife and I were
getting married that year.
We asked our relatives to forgo
the wedding registry gifts
and instead donate some money
so we could have some start-up money
to launch a nonprofit.
I promise you, I'm a lot
more romantic than that.
(Laughter)
We ended up raising $6,000,
teamed up with some
Liberians and Americans
and launched a nonprofit
called Last Mile Health.
Our goal is to bring a health worker
within reach of everyone, everywhere.
We designed a three-step process --
train, equip and pay --
to invest more deeply
in volunteers like Musu
to become paraprofessionals,
to become community health workers.
First we trained Musu to prevent,
diagnose and treat
the top 10 diseases afflicting
families in her village.
A nurse supervisor visited her
every month to coach her.
We equipped her with modern
medical technology,
like this $1 malaria rapid test,
and put it in a backpack
full of medicines like this
to treat infections like pneumonia,
and crucially,
a smartphone, to help her track
and report on epidemics.
Last, we recognized
the dignity in Musu's work.
With the Liberian government,
we created a contract,
paid her
and gave her the chance
to have a real job.
And she's amazing.
Musu has learned over 30 medical skills,
from screening children for malnutrition,
to assessing the cause
of a child's cough with a smartphone,
to supporting people with HIV
and providing follow-up care
to patients who've lost their limbs.
Working as part of our team,
working as paraprofessionals,
community health workers can help ensure
that a lot of what
your family doctor would do
reaches the places that most
family doctors could never go.
One of my favorite things to do
is to care for patients
with community health workers.
So last year I was visiting A.B.,
and like Musu, A.B. had had
a chance to go to school.
He was in middle school,
in the eighth grade,
when his parents died.
He became an orphan and had to drop out.
Last year, we hired and trained
A.B. as a community health worker.
And while he was making
door to door house calls,
he met this young boy named Prince,
whose mother had had trouble
breastfeeding him,
and by the age of six months,
Prince had started to waste away.
A.B. had just been taught how to use
this color-coded measuring tape
that wraps around the upper arm
of a child to diagnose malnutrition.
A.B. noticed that Prince
was in the red zone,
which meant he had to be hospitalized.
So A.B. took Prince
and his mother to the river,
got in a canoe
and paddled for four hours
to get to the hospital.
Later, after Prince was discharged,
A.B. taught mom how to feed baby
a food supplement.
A few months ago,
A.B. took me to visit Prince,
and he's a chubby little guy.
(Laughter)
He's meeting his milestones,
he's pulled himself up to a stand,
and is even starting to say a few words.
I'm so inspired by these
community health workers.
I often ask them why they do what they do,
and when I asked A.B.,
he said, "Doc, since I dropped out
of school, this is the first time
I'm having a chance
to hold a pen to write.
My brain is getting fresh."
The stories of A.B. and Musu
have taught me something fundamental
about being human.
Our will to serve others
can actually help us
transform our own conditions.
I was so moved by how powerful
the will to serve our neighbors can be
a few years ago,
when we faced a global catastrophe.
In December 2013,
something happened in the rainforests
across the border from us in Guinea.
A toddler named Emile fell sick
with vomiting, fever and diarrhea.
He lived in an area
where the roads were sparse
and there had been massive
shortages of health workers.
Emile died,
and a few weeks later his sister died,
and a few weeks later his mother died.
And this disease would spread
from one community to another.
And it wasn't until three months later
that the world recognized this as Ebola.
When every minute counted,
we had already lost months,
and by then the virus had spread
like wildfire all across West Africa,
and eventually to other
parts of the world.
Businesses shut down,
airlines started canceling routes.
At the height of the crisis,
when we were told that 1.4 million
people could be infected,
when we were told
that most of them would die,
when we had nearly lost all hope,
I remember standing with a group
of health workers
in the rainforest where
an outbreak had just happened.
We were helping train and equip
them to put on the masks,
the gloves and the gowns that they needed
to keep themselves safe from the virus
while they were serving their patients.
I remember the fear in their eyes.
And I remember staying up at night,
terrified if I'd made the right call
to keep them in the field.
When Ebola threatened to bring
humanity to its knees,
Liberia's community health workers
didn't surrender to fear.
They did what they had always done:
they answered the call
to serve their neighbors.
Community members across Liberia
learned the symptoms of Ebola,
teamed up with nurses and doctors
to go door-to-door to find the sick
and get them into care.
They tracked thousands of people
who had been exposed to the virus
and helped break
the chain of transmission.
Some ten thousand community
health workers risked their own lives
to help hunt down this virus
and stop it in its tracks.
(Applause)
Today, Ebola has come
under control in West Africa,
and we've learned a few things.
We've learned that blind spots
in rural health care
can lead to hot spots of disease,
and that places all of us at greater risk.
We've learned that the most efficient
emergency system
is actually an everyday system,
and that system has to reach
all communities,
including rural communities like Emile's.
And most of all,
we've learned from the courage
of Liberia's community health workers
that we as people are not defined
by the conditions we face,
no matter how hopeless they seem.
We're defined by how we respond to them.
For the past 15 years,
I've seen the power of this idea
to transform everyday citizens
into community health workers --
into everyday heroes.
And I've seen it play out everywhere,
from the forest communities
of West Africa,
to the rural fishing villages of Alaska.
It's true,
these community health workers
aren't doing neurosurgery,
but they're making it possible
to bring health care within reach
of everyone everywhere.
So now what?
Well, we know that there are still
millions of people dying
from preventable causes
in rural communities around the world.
And we know that the great majority
of these deaths are happening
in these 75 blue-shaded countries.
What we also know
is that if we trained an army
of community health workers
to learn even just 30 lifesaving skills,
we could save the lives of nearly
30 million people by 2030.
Thirty services could save
30 million lives by 2030.
That's not just a blueprint --
we're proving this can be done.
In Liberia,
the Liberian government is training
thousands of workers like A.B. and Musu
after Ebola,
to bring health care to every
child and family in the country.
And we've been honored to work with them,
and are now teaming up
with a number of organizations
that are working across other countries
to try to help them do the same thing.
If we could help these countries scale,
we could save millions of lives,
and at the same time,
we could create millions of jobs.
We simply can't do that, though,
without technology.
People are worried that technology
is going to steal our jobs,
but when it comes
to community health workers,
technology has actually
been vital for creating jobs.
Without technology --
without this smartphone,
without this rapid test --
it would have been impossible for us
to be able to employ A.B. and Musu.
And I think it's time
for technology to help us train,
to help us train people faster
and better than ever before.
As a doctor,
I use technology to stay up-to-date
and keep certified.
I use smartphones, I use apps,
I use online courses.
But when A.B. wants to learn,
he's got to jump back in that canoe
and get to the training center.
And when Musu shows up for training,
her instructors are stuck using
flip charts and markers.
Why shouldn't they have the same
access to learn as I do?
If we truly want community health workers
to master those lifesaving skills
and even more,
we've got to change this old-school
model of education.
Tech can truly be a game changer here.
I've been in awe of the digital
education revolution
that the likes of Khan Academy
and edX have been leading.
And I've been thinking that it's time;
it's time for a collision
between the digital education revolution
and the community health revolution.
And so, this brings me
to my TED Prize wish.
I wish --
I wish that you would help us recruit
the largest army of community health
workers the world has ever known
by creating the Community Health Academy,
a global platform to train,
connect and empower.
(Applause)
Thank you.
(Applause)
Thank you.
Here's the idea:
we'll create and curate
the best in digital education resources.
We will bring those to community
health workers around the world,
including A.B. and Musu.
They'll get video lessons
on giving kids vaccines
and have online courses
on spotting the next outbreak,
so they're not stuck using flip charts.
We'll help these countries
accredit these workers,
so that they're not stuck remaining
an under-recognized, undervalued group,
but become a renowned,
empowered profession,
just like nurses and doctors.
And we'll create a network
of companies and entrepreneurs
who've created innovations
that can save lives
and help them connect
to workers like Musu,
so she can help better
serve her community.
And we'll work tirelessly
to persuade governments
to make community health workers
a cornerstone of their health care plans.
We plan to test and prototype
the academy in Liberia
and a few other partner countries,
and then we plan to take it global,
including to rural North America.
With the power of this platform,
we believe countries can be more persuaded
that a health care revolution
really is possible.
My dream is that this academy
will contribute to the training
of hundreds of thousands
of community members
to help bring health care
to their neighbors --
the hundreds of millions of them
that live in the world's most
remote communities,
from the forest communities
of West Africa,
to the fishing villages of rural Alaska;
from the hilltops of Appalachia,
to the mountains of Afghanistan.
If this vision is aligned with yours,
head to communityhealthacademy.org,
and join this revolution.
Let us know if you or your organization
or someone you know could help us
as we try to build this academy
over the next year.
Now, as I look out into this room,
I realize that our journeys
are not self-made;
they're shaped by others.
And there have been so many here
that have been part of this cause.
We're so honored to be part
of this community,
and a community that's willing
to take on a cause
as audacious as this one,
so I wanted to offer, as I end,
a reflection.
I think a lot more about
what my father taught me.
These days, I too have become a dad.
I have two sons,
and my wife and I just learned
that she's pregnant with our third child.
(Applause)
Thank you.
(Applause)
I was recently caring
for a woman in Liberia
who, like my wife,
was in her third pregnancy.
But unlike my wife,
had had no prenatal care
with her first two babies.
She lived in an isolated community
in the forest that had gone for 100 years
without any health care
until ...
until last year when a nurse
trained her neighbors
to become community health workers.
So here I was,
seeing this patient
who was in her second trimester,
and I pulled out the ultrasound
to check on the baby,
and she started telling us stories
about her first two kids,
and I had the ultrasound
probe on her belly,
and she just stopped mid-sentence.
She turned to me and she said,
"Doc, what's that sound?"
It was the first time she'd ever heard
her baby's heartbeat.
And her eyes lit up in the same way
my wife's eyes and my own eyes lit up
when we heard our baby's heartbeat.
For all of human history,
illness has been universal
and access to care has not.
But as a wise man once told me:
no condition is permanent.
It's time.
It's time for us to go as far as it takes
to change this condition together.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Ten years ago,
computer vision researchers
thought that getting a computer
to tell the difference
between a cat and a dog
would be almost impossible,
even with the significant advance
in the state of artificial intelligence.
Now we can do it at a level
greater than 99 percent accuracy.
This is called image classification --
give it an image,
put a label to that image --
and computers know
thousands of other categories as well.
I'm a graduate student
at the University of Washington,
and I work on a project called Darknet,
which is a neural network framework
for training and testing
computer vision models.
So let's just see what Darknet thinks
of this image that we have.
When we run our classifier
on this image,
we see we don't just get
a prediction of dog or cat,
we actually get
specific breed predictions.
That's the level
of granularity we have now.
And it's correct.
My dog is in fact a malamute.
So we've made amazing strides
in image classification,
but what happens
when we run our classifier
on an image that looks like this?
Well ...
We see that the classifier comes back
with a pretty similar prediction.
And it's correct,
there is a malamute in the image,
but just given this label,
we don't actually know that much
about what's going on in the image.
We need something more powerful.
I work on a problem
called object detection,
where we look at an image
and try to find all of the objects,
put bounding boxes around them
and say what those objects are.
So here's what happens
when we run a detector on this image.
Now, with this kind of result,
we can do a lot more
with our computer vision algorithms.
We see that it knows
that there's a cat and a dog.
It knows their relative locations,
their size.
It may even know some extra information.
There's a book sitting in the background.
And if you want to build a system
on top of computer vision,
say a self-driving vehicle
or a robotic system,
this is the kind
of information that you want.
You want something so that
you can interact with the physical world.
Now, when I started working
on object detection,
it took 20 seconds
to process a single image.
And to get a feel for why
speed is so important in this domain,
here's an example of an object detector
that takes two seconds
to process an image.
So this is 10 times faster
than the 20-seconds-per-image detector,
and you can see that by the time
it makes predictions,
the entire state of the world has changed,
and this wouldn't be very useful
for an application.
If we speed this up
by another factor of 10,
this is a detector running
at five frames per second.
This is a lot better,
but for example,
if there's any significant movement,
I wouldn't want a system
like this driving my car.
This is our detection system
running in real time on my laptop.
So it smoothly tracks me
as I move around the frame,
and it's robust to a wide variety
of changes in size,
pose,
forward, backward.
This is great.
This is what we really need
if we're going to build systems
on top of computer vision.
(Applause)
So in just a few years,
we've gone from 20 seconds per image
to 20 milliseconds per image,
a thousand times faster.
How did we get there?
Well, in the past,
object detection systems
would take an image like this
and split it into a bunch of regions
and then run a classifier
on each of these regions,
and high scores for that classifier
would be considered
detections in the image.
But this involved running a classifier
thousands of times over an image,
thousands of neural network evaluations
to produce detection.
Instead, we trained a single network
to do all of detection for us.
It produces all of the bounding boxes
and class probabilities simultaneously.
With our system, instead of looking
at an image thousands of times
to produce detection,
you only look once,
and that's why we call it
the YOLO method of object detection.
So with this speed,
we're not just limited to images;
we can process video in real time.
And now, instead of just seeing
that cat and dog,
we can see them move around
and interact with each other.
This is a detector that we trained
on 80 different classes
in Microsoft's COCO dataset.
It has all sorts of things
like spoon and fork, bowl,
common objects like that.
It has a variety of more exotic things:
animals, cars, zebras, giraffes.
And now we're going to do something fun.
We're just going to go
out into the audience
and see what kind of things we can detect.
Does anyone want a stuffed animal?
There are some teddy bears out there.
And we can turn down
our threshold for detection a little bit,
so we can find more of you guys
out in the audience.
Let's see if we can get these stop signs.
We find some backpacks.
Let's just zoom in a little bit.
And this is great.
And all of the processing
is happening in real time
on the laptop.
And it's important to remember
that this is a general purpose
object detection system,
so we can train this for any image domain.
The same code that we use
to find stop signs or pedestrians,
bicycles in a self-driving vehicle,
can be used to find cancer cells
in a tissue biopsy.
And there are researchers around the globe
already using this technology
for advances in things
like medicine, robotics.
This morning, I read a paper
where they were taking a census
of animals in Nairobi National Park
with YOLO as part
of this detection system.
And that's because Darknet is open source
and in the public domain,
free for anyone to use.
(Applause)
But we wanted to make detection
even more accessible and usable,
so through a combination
of model optimization,
network binarization and approximation,
we actually have object detection
running on a phone.
(Applause)
And I'm really excited because
now we have a pretty powerful solution
to this low-level computer vision problem,
and anyone can take it
and build something with it.
So now the rest is up to all of you
and people around the world
with access to this software,
and I can't wait to see what people
will build with this technology.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Do you ever feel completely overwhelmed
when you're faced with a complex problem?
Well, I hope to change that in less than three minutes.
So, I hope to convince you that complex
doesn't always equal complicated.
So for me, a well-crafted baguette, fresh out of the oven,
is complex,
but a curry onion green olive poppy cheese bread
is complicated.
I'm an ecologist, and I study complexity. I love complexity.
And I study that in the natural world, the interconnectedness of species.
So here's a food web,
or a map of feeding links between species
that live in Alpine Lakes in the mountains of California.
And this is what happens to that food web
when it's stocked with non-native fish that never lived there before.
All the grayed-out species disappear.
Some are actually on the brink of extinction.
And lakes with fish have more mosquitos, even though they eat them.
These effects were all unanticipated,
and yet we're discovering they're predictable.
So I want to share with you a couple key insights
about complexity we're learning from studying nature
that maybe are applicable to other problems.
First is the simple power of good visualization tools
to help untangle complexity
and just encourage you to ask questions you didn't think of before.
For example, you could plot the flow of carbon
through corporate supply chains in a corporate ecosystem,
or the interconnections of habitat patches
for endangered species in Yosemite National Park.
The next thing is that if you want to predict
the effect of one species on another,
if you focus only on that link,
and then you black box the rest,
it's actually less predictable
than if you step back, consider the entire system -- all the species, all the links --
and from that place,
hone in on the sphere of influence that matters most.
And we're discovering, with our research,
that's often very local to the node you care about
within one or two degrees.
So the more you step back, embrace complexity,
the better chance you have of finding simple answers,
and it's often different than the simple answer that you started with.
So let's switch gears and look at a really complex problem
courtesy of the U.S. government.
This is a diagram of the U.S. counterinsurgency strategy in Afghanistan.
It was front page of the New York Times a couple months ago.
Instantly ridiculed by the media
for being so crazy complicated.
And the stated goal was to increase popular support
for the Afghan government.
Clearly a complex problem,
but is it complicated?
Well, when I saw this in the front page of the Times,
I thought, "Great. Finally something I can relate to.
I can sink my teeth into this."
So let's do it. So here we go for the first time ever,
a world premiere view of this spaghetti diagram as an ordered network.
The circled node is the one we're trying to influence --
popular support for the government.
And so now we can look one degrees, two degrees,
three degrees away from that node
and eliminate three-quarters of the diagram outside that sphere of influence.
Within that sphere,
most of those nodes are not actionable, like the harshness of the terrain,
and a very small minority are actual military actions.
Most are non-violent and they fall into two broad categories:
active engagement with ethnic rivalries and religious beliefs
and fair, transparent economic development
and provisioning of services.
I don't know about this, but this is what I can decipher from this diagram
in 24 seconds.
When you see a diagram like this, I don't want you to be afraid.
I want you to be excited. I want you to be relieved.
Because simple answers may emerge.
We're discovering in nature that simplicity often lies
on the other side of complexity.
So for any problem, the more you can zoom out and embrace complexity,
the better chance you have of zooming in
on the simple details that matter most.
Thank you.
(Applause)
I'd like to introduce you
to a tiny microorganism
that you've probably never heard of:
its name is Prochlorococcus,
and it's really an amazing little being.
For one thing, its ancestors
changed the earth in ways
that made it possible for us to evolve,
and hidden in its genetic code
is a blueprint
that may inspire ways to reduce
our dependency on fossil fuel.
But the most amazing thing
is that there are
three billion billion billion
of these tiny cells on the planet,
and we didn't know they existed
until 35 years ago.
So to tell you their story,
I need to first take you way back,
four billion years ago, when the earth
might have looked something like this.
There was no life on the planet,
there was no oxygen in the atmosphere.
So what happened to change that planet
into the one we enjoy today,
teeming with life,
teeming with plants and animals?
Well, in a word, photosynthesis.
About two and a half billion years ago,
some of these ancient ancestors
of Prochlorococcus evolved
so that they could use solar energy
and absorb it
and split water into its component parts
of oxygen and hydrogen.
And they used the chemical energy produced
to draw CO2, carbon dioxide,
out of the atmosphere
and use it to build sugars
and proteins and amino acids,
all the things that life is made of.
And as they evolved and grew more and more
over millions and millions of years,
that oxygen accumulated in the atmosphere.
Until about 500 million years ago,
there was enough in the atmosphere
that larger organisms could evolve.
There was an explosion of life-forms,
and, ultimately, we appeared on the scene.
While that was going on,
some of those ancient
photosynthesizers died
and were compressed and buried,
and became fossil fuel
with sunlight buried
in their carbon bonds.
They're basically buried sunlight
in the form of coal and oil.
Today's photosynthesizers,
their engines are descended
from those ancient microbes,
and they feed basically
all of life on earth.
Your heart is beating
using the solar energy
that some plant processed for you,
and the stuff your body is made out of
is made out of CO2
that some plant processed for you.
Basically, we're all made
out of sunlight and carbon dioxide.
Fundamentally, we're just hot air.
(Laughter)
So as terrestrial beings,
we're very familiar
with the plants on land:
the trees, the grasses,
the pastures, the crops.
But the oceans are filled
with billions of tons of animals.
Do you ever wonder what's feeding them?
Well there's an invisible pasture
of microscopic photosynthesizers
called phytoplankton
that fill the upper
200 meters of the ocean,
and they feed the entire
open ocean ecosystem.
Some of the animals
live among them and eat them,
and others swim up
to feed on them at night,
while others sit in the deep
and wait for them to die and settle down
and then they chow down on them.
So these tiny phytoplankton,
collectively, weigh less than
one percent of all the plants on land,
but annually they photosynthesize
as much as all of the plants on land,
including the Amazon rainforest
that we consider the lungs of the planet.
Every year, they fix
50 billion tons of carbon
in the form of carbon dioxide
into their bodies
that feeds the ocean ecosystem.
How does this tiny amount of biomass
produce as much as all the plants on land?
Well, they don't have trunks and stems
and flowers and fruits
and all that to maintain.
All they have to do is grow and divide
and grow and divide.
They're really lean
little photosynthesis machines.
They really crank.
So there are thousands
of different species of phytoplankton,
come in all different shapes and sizes,
all roughly less than the width
of a human hair.
Here, I'm showing you
some of the more beautiful ones,
the textbook versions.
I call them the charismatic
species of phytoplankton.
And here is Prochlorococcus.
I know,
it just looks like a bunch
of schmutz on a microscope slide.
(Laughter)
But they're in there,
and I'm going to reveal them
to you in a minute.
But first I want to tell you
how they were discovered.
About 38 years ago,
we were playing around with a technology
in my lab called flow cytometry
that was developed for biomedical research
for studying cells like cancer cells,
but it turns out we were using it
for this off-label purpose
which was to study phytoplankton,
and it was beautifully suited to do that.
And here's how it works:
so you inject a sample
in this tiny little capillary tube,
and the cells go single file by a laser,
and as they do, they scatter light
according to their size
and they emit light according
to whatever pigments they might have,
whether they're natural
or whether you stain them.
And the chlorophyl of phytoplankton,
which is green,
emits red light
when you shine blue light on it.
And so we used this instrument
for several years
to study our phytoplankton cultures,
species like those charismatic
ones that I showed you,
just studying their basic cell biology.
But all that time, we thought,
well wouldn't it be really cool
if we could take an instrument
like this out on a ship
and just squirt seawater through it
and see what all those diversity
of phytoplankton would look like.
So I managed to get my hands
on what we call a big rig
in flow cytometry,
a large, powerful laser
with a money-back guarantee
from the company
that if it didn't work on a ship,
they would take it back.
And so a young scientist
that I was working with at the time,
Rob Olson, was able
to take this thing apart,
put it on a ship, put it back together
and take it off to sea.
And it worked like a charm.
We didn't think it would,
because we thought the ship's vibrations
would get in the way
of the focusing of the laser,
but it really worked like a charm.
And so we mapped the phytoplankton
distributions across the ocean.
For the first time, you could look at them
one cell at a time in real time
and see what was going on --
that was very exciting.
But one day, Rob noticed
some faint signals
coming out of the instrument
that we dismissed as electronic noise
for probably a year
before we realized that it wasn't
really behaving like noise.
It had some regular patterns to it.
To make a long story short,
it was tiny, tiny little cells,
less than one-one hundredth
the width of a human hair
that contain chlorophyl.
That was Prochlorococcus.
So remember this slide that I showed you?
If you shine blue light
on that same sample,
this is what you see:
two tiny little red light-emitting cells.
Those are Prochlorococcus.
They are the smallest and most abundant
photosynthetic cell on the planet.
At first, we didn't know what they were,
so we called the "little greens."
It was a very affectionate name for them.
Ultimately, we knew enough about them
to give them the name Prochlorococcus,
which means "primitive green berry."
And it was about that time
that I became so smitten
by these little cells
that I redirected my entire lab
to study them and nothing else,
and my loyalty to them
has really paid off.
They've given me a tremendous amount,
including bringing me here.
(Applause)
So over the years,
we and others, many others,
have studied Prochlorococcus
across the oceans
and found that they're very abundant
over wide, wide ranges
in the open ocean ecosystem.
They're particularly abundant
in what are called the open ocean gyres.
These are sometimes referred to
as the deserts of the oceans,
but they're not deserts at all.
Their deep blue water is teeming
with a hundred million
Prochlorococcus cells per liter.
If you crowd them together
like we do in our cultures,
you can see their beautiful
green chlorophyl.
One of those test tubes
has a billion Prochlorococcus in it,
and as I told you earlier,
there are three billion billion billion
of them on the planet.
That's three octillion,
if you care to convert.
(Laughter)
And collectively, they weigh
more than the human population
and they photosynthesize
as much as all of the crops on land.
They're incredibly important
in the global ocean.
So over the years,
as we were studying them
and found how abundant they were,
we thought, hmm, this is really strange.
How can a single species be so abundant
across so many different habitats?
And as we isolated more into culture,
we learned that they
are different ecotypes.
There are some that are adapted
to the high-light intensities
in the surface water,
and there are some that are adapted
to the low light in the deep ocean.
In fact, those cells that live
in the bottom of the sunlit zone
are the most efficient
photosynthesizers of any known cell.
And then we learned
that there are some strains
that grow optimally along the equator,
where there are higher temperatures,
and some that do better
at the cooler temperatures
as you go north and south.
So as we studied these more and more
and kept finding more and more diversity,
we thought, oh my God,
how diverse are these things?
And about that time, it became
possible to sequence their genomes
and really look under the hood
and look at their genetic makeup.
And we've been able to sequence
the genomes of cultures that we have,
but also recently, using flow cytometry,
we can isolate
individual cells from the wild
and sequence their individual genomes,
and now we've sequenced
hundreds of Prochlorococcus.
And although each cell
has roughly 2,000 genes --
that's one tenth the size
of the human genome --
as you sequence more and more,
you find that they only have
a thousand of those in common
and the other thousand
for each individual strain
is drawn from an enormous gene pool,
and it reflects the particular environment
that the cell might have thrived in,
not just high or low light
or high or low temperature,
but whether there are
nutrients that limit them
like nitrogen, phosphorus or iron.
It reflects the habitat
that they come from.
Think of it this way.
If each cell is a smartphone
and the apps are the genes,
when you get your smartphone,
it comes with these built-in apps.
Those are the ones that you can't delete
if you're an iPhone person.
You press on them and they don't jiggle
and they don't have x's.
Even if you don't want them,
you can't get rid of them.
(Laughter)
Those are like the core genes
of Prochlorococcus.
They're the essence of the phone.
But you have a huge pool
of apps to draw upon
to make your phone custom-designed
for your particular lifestyle and habitat.
If you travel a lot,
you'll have a lot of travel apps,
if you're into financial things,
you might have a lot of financial apps,
or if you're like me,
you probably have a lot of weather apps,
hoping one of them will tell you
what you want to hear.
(Laughter)
And I've learned the last
couple days in Vancouver
that you don't need a weather app --
you just need an umbrella.
So --
(Laughter)
(Applause)
So just as your smartphone tells us
something about how you live your life,
your lifestyle,
reading the genome
of a Prochlorococcus cell
tells us what the pressures are
in its environment.
It's like reading its diary,
not only telling us how it got
through its day or its week,
but even its evolutionary history.
As we studied -- I said we've
sequenced hundreds of these cells,
and we can now project
what is the total genetic size --
gene pool --
of the Prochlorococcus
federation, as we call it.
It's like a superorganism.
And it turns out that projections are
that the collective has 80,000 genes.
That's four times the size
of the human genome.
And it's that diversity of gene pools
that makes it possible for them
to dominate these large
regions of the oceans
and maintain their stability
year in and year out.
So when I daydream about Prochlorococcus,
which I probably do more
than is healthy --
(Laughter)
I imagine them floating out there,
doing their job,
maintaining the planet,
feeding the animals.
But also I inevitably end up
thinking about what
a masterpiece they are,
finely tuned by millions
of years of evolution.
With 2,000 genes,
they can do what
all of our human ingenuity
has not figured out how to do yet.
They can take solar energy, CO2
and turn it into chemical energy
in the form of organic carbon,
locking that sunlight
in those carbon bonds.
If we could figure out
exactly how they do this,
it could inspire designs
that could reduce
our dependency on fossil fuels,
which brings my story full circle.
The fossil fuels that are buried
that we're burning
took millions of years
for the earth to bury those,
including those ancestors
of Prochlorococcus,
and we're burning that now
in the blink of an eye
on geological timescales.
Carbon dioxide is increasing
in the atmosphere.
It's a greenhouse gas.
The oceans are starting to warm.
So the question is,
what is that going to do
for my Prochlorococcus?
And I'm sure you're expecting me to say
that my beloved microbes are doomed,
but in fact they're not.
Projections are that their populations
will expand as the ocean warms
to 30 percent larger by the year 2100.
Does that make me happy?
Well, it makes me happy
for Prochlorococcus of course --
(Laughter)
but not for the planet.
There are winners and losers
in this global experiment
that we've undertaken,
and it's projected that among the losers
will be some of those
larger phytoplankton,
those charismatic ones
which are expected
to be reduced in numbers,
and they're the ones that feed
the zooplankton that feed the fish
that we like to harvest.
So Prochlorococcus has been
my muse for the past 35 years,
but there are legions
of other microbes out there
maintaining our planet for us.
They're out there
ready and waiting for us to find them
so they can tell their stories, too.
Thank you.
(Applause)
So the Awesome story:
It begins about 40 years ago,
when my mom and my dad came to Canada.
My mom left Nairobi, Kenya.
My dad left a small village outside of Amritsar, India.
And they got here in the late 1960s.
They settled in a shady suburb about an hour east of Toronto,
and they settled into a new life.
They saw their first dentist,
they ate their first hamburger,
and they had their first kids.
My sister and I
grew up here,
and we had quiet, happy childhoods.
We had close family,
good friends, a quiet street.
We grew up taking for granted
a lot of the things that my parents couldn't take for granted
when they grew up --
things like power always on
in our houses,
things like schools across the street
and hospitals down the road
and popsicles in the backyard.
We grew up, and we grew older.
I went to high school.
I graduated.
I moved out of the house, I got a job,
I found a girl, I settled down --
and I realize it sounds like a bad sitcom or a Cat Stevens' song --
(Laughter)
but life was pretty good.
Life was pretty good.
2006 was a great year.
Under clear blue skies in July in the wine region of Ontario,
I got married,
surrounded by 150 family and friends.
2007 was a great year.
I graduated from school,
and I went on a road trip with two of my closest friends.
Here's a picture of me and my friend, Chris,
on the coast of the Pacific Ocean.
We actually saw seals out of our car window,
and we pulled over to take a quick picture of them
and then blocked them with our giant heads.
(Laughter)
So you can't actually see them,
but it was breathtaking,
believe me.
(Laughter)
2008 and 2009 were a little tougher.
I know that they were tougher for a lot of people,
not just me.
First of all, the news was so heavy.
It's still heavy now, and it was heavy before that,
but when you flipped open a newspaper, when you turned on the TV,
it was about ice caps melting,
wars going on around the world,
earthquakes, hurricanes
and an economy that was wobbling on the brink of collapse,
and then eventually did collapse,
and so many of us losing our homes,
or our jobs,
or our retirements,
or our livelihoods.
2008, 2009 were heavy years for me for another reason, too.
I was going through a lot of personal problems at the time.
My marriage wasn't going well,
and we just were growing further and further apart.
One day my wife came home from work
and summoned the courage, through a lot of tears,
to have a very honest conversation.
And she said, "I don't love you anymore,"
and it was one of the most painful things I'd ever heard
and certainly the most heartbreaking thing I'd ever heard,
until only a month later,
when I heard something even more heartbreaking.
My friend Chris, who I just showed you a picture of,
had been battling mental illness for some time.
And for those of you
whose lives have been touched by mental illness,
you know how challenging it can be.
I spoke to him on the phone at 10:30 p.m.
on a Sunday night.
We talked about the TV show we watched that evening.
And Monday morning, I found out that he disappeared.
Very sadly, he took his own life.
And it was a really heavy time.
And as these dark clouds were circling me,
and I was finding it really, really difficult
to think of anything good,
I said to myself that I really needed a way
to focus on the positive somehow.
So I came home from work one night,
and I logged onto the computer,
and I started up a tiny website
called 1000awesomethings.com.
I was trying to remind myself
of the simple, universal, little pleasures that we all love,
but we just don't talk about enough --
things like waiters and waitresses
who bring you free refills without asking,
being the first table to get called up
to the dinner buffet at a wedding,
wearing warm underwear from just out of the dryer,
or when cashiers open up a new check-out lane at the grocery store
and you get to be first in line --
even if you were last at the other line, swoop right in there.
(Laughter)
And slowly over time,
I started putting myself in a better mood.
I mean, 50,000 blogs
are started a day,
and so my blog was just one of those 50,000.
And nobody read it except for my mom.
Although I should say that my traffic did skyrocket
and go up by 100 percent
when she forwarded it to my dad.
(Laughter)
And then I got excited
when it started getting tens of hits,
and then I started getting excited when it started getting dozens
and then hundreds and then thousands
and then millions.
It started getting bigger and bigger and bigger.
And then I got a phone call,
and the voice at the other end of the line said,
"You've just won the Best Blog In the World award."
I was like, that sounds totally fake.
(Laughter)
(Applause)
Which African country do you want me to wire all my money to?
(Laughter)
But it turns out, I jumped on a plane,
and I ended up walking a red carpet
between Sarah Silverman and Jimmy Fallon and Martha Stewart.
And I went onstage to accept a Webby award for Best Blog.
And the surprise
and just the amazement of that
was only overshadowed by my return to Toronto,
when, in my inbox,
10 literary agents were waiting for me
to talk about putting this into a book.
Flash-forward to the next year
and "The Book of Awesome" has now been
number one on the bestseller list for 20 straight weeks.
(Applause)
But look, I said I wanted to do three things with you today.
I said I wanted to tell you the Awesome story,
I wanted to share with you the three As of Awesome,
and I wanted to leave you with a closing thought.
So let's talk about those three As.
Over the last few years,
I haven't had that much time to really think.
But lately I have had the opportunity to take a step back
and ask myself: "What is it over the last few years
that helped me grow my website,
but also grow myself?"
And I've summarized those things, for me personally,
as three As.
They are Attitude, Awareness
and Authenticity.
I'd love to just talk about each one briefly.
So Attitude:
Look, we're all going to get lumps,
and we're all going to get bumps.
None of us can predict the future, but we do know one thing about it
and that's that it ain't gonna go according to plan.
We will all have high highs
and big days and proud moments
of smiles on graduation stages,
father-daughter dances at weddings
and healthy babies screeching in the delivery room,
but between those high highs,
we may also have some lumps and some bumps too.
It's sad, and it's not pleasant to talk about,
but your husband might leave you,
your girlfriend could cheat,
your headaches might be more serious than you thought,
or your dog could get hit by a car on the street.
It's not a happy thought,
but your kids could get mixed up in gangs
or bad scenes.
Your mom could get cancer,
your dad could get mean.
And there are times in life
when you will be tossed in the well, too,
with twists in your stomach and with holes in your heart,
and when that bad news washes over you,
and when that pain sponges and soaks in,
I just really hope you feel
like you've always got two choices.
One, you can swirl and twirl
and gloom and doom forever,
or two, you can grieve
and then face the future
with newly sober eyes.
Having a great attitude is about choosing option number two,
and choosing, no matter how difficult it is,
no matter what pain hits you,
choosing to move forward and move on
and take baby steps into the future.
The second "A" is Awareness.
I love hanging out with three year-olds.
I love the way that they see the world,
because they're seeing the world for the first time.
I love the way that they can stare at a bug crossing the sidewalk.
I love the way that they'll stare slack-jawed
at their first baseball game
with wide eyes and a mitt on their hand,
soaking in the crack of the bat and the crunch of the peanuts
and the smell of the hotdogs.
I love the way that they'll spend hours picking dandelions in the backyard
and putting them into a nice centerpiece
for Thanksgiving dinner.
I love the way that they see the world,
because they're seeing the world
for the first time.
Having a sense of awareness
is just about embracing your inner three year-old.
Because you all used to be three years old.
That three-year-old boy is still part of you.
That three-year-old girl is still part of you.
They're in there.
And being aware is just about remembering
that you saw everything you've seen
for the first time once, too.
So there was a time when it was your first time ever
hitting a string of green lights on the way home from work.
There was the first time you walked by the open door of a bakery
and smelt the bakery air,
or the first time you pulled a 20-dollar bill out of your old jacket pocket
and said, "Found money."
The last "A" is Authenticity.
And for this one, I want to tell you a quick story.
Let's go all the way back to 1932
when, on a peanut farm in Georgia,
a little baby boy named Roosevelt Grier was born.
Roosevelt Grier, or Rosey Grier, as people used to call him,
grew up and grew into
a 300-pound, six-foot-five linebacker in the NFL.
He's number 76 in the picture.
Here he is pictured with the "fearsome foursome."
These were four guys on the L.A. Rams in the 1960s
you did not want to go up against.
They were tough football players doing what they love,
which was crushing skulls
and separating shoulders on the football field.
But Rosey Grier also had
another passion.
In his deeply authentic self,
he also loved needlepoint. (Laughter)
He loved knitting.
He said that it calmed him down, it relaxed him,
it took away his fear of flying and helped him meet chicks.
That's what he said.
I mean, he loved it so much that, after he retired from the NFL,
he started joining clubs.
And he even put out a book
called "Rosey Grier's Needlepoint for Men."
(Laughter)
(Applause)
It's a great cover.
If you notice, he's actually needlepointing his own face.
(Laughter)
And so what I love about this story
is that Rosey Grier
is just such an authentic person,
and that's what authenticity is all about.
It's just about being you and being cool with that.
And I think when you're authentic,
you end up following your heart,
and you put yourself in places
and situations and in conversations
that you love and that you enjoy.
You meet people that you like talking to.
You go places you've dreamt about.
And you end you end up following your heart
and feeling very fulfilled.
So those are the three A's.
For the closing thought, I want to take you all the way back
to my parents coming to Canada.
I don't know what it would feel like
coming to a new country when you're in your mid-20s.
I don't know, because I never did it,
but I would imagine that it would take a great attitude.
I would imagine that you'd have to be pretty aware of your surroundings
and appreciating the small wonders
that you're starting to see in your new world.
And I think you'd have to be really authentic,
you'd have to be really true to yourself
in order to get through what you're being exposed to.
I'd like to pause my TEDTalk
for about 10 seconds right now,
because you don't get many opportunities in life to do something like this,
and my parents are sitting in the front row.
So I wanted to ask them to, if they don't mind, stand up.
And I just wanted to say thank you to you guys.
(Applause)
When I was growing up, my dad used to love telling the story
of his first day in Canada.
And it's a great story, because what happened was
he got off the plane at the Toronto airport,
and he was welcomed by a non-profit group,
which I'm sure someone in this room runs.
(Laughter)
And this non-profit group had a big welcoming lunch
for all the new immigrants to Canada.
And my dad says he got off the plane and he went to this lunch
and there was this huge spread.
There was bread, there was those little, mini dill pickles,
there was olives, those little white onions.
There was rolled up turkey cold cuts,
rolled up ham cold cuts, rolled up roast beef cold cuts
and little cubes of cheese.
There was tuna salad sandwiches and egg salad sandwiches
and salmon salad sandwiches.
There was lasagna, there was casseroles,
there was brownies, there was butter tarts,
and there was pies, lots and lots of pies.
And when my dad tells the story, he says,
"The craziest thing was, I'd never seen any of that before, except bread.
(Laughter)
I didn't know what was meat, what was vegetarian.
I was eating olives with pie.
(Laughter)
I just couldn't believe how many things you can get here."
(Laughter)
When I was five years old,
my dad used to take me grocery shopping,
and he would stare in wonder
at the little stickers that are on the fruits and vegetables.
He would say, "Look, can you believe they have a mango here from Mexico?
They've got an apple here from South Africa.
Can you believe they've got a date from Morocco?"
He's like, "Do you know where Morocco even is?"
And I'd say, "I'm five. I don't even know where I am.
Is this A&amp;P?"
And he'd say, "I don't know where Morocco is either, but let's find out."
And so we'd buy the date, and we'd go home.
And we'd actually take an atlas off the shelf,
and we'd flip through until we found this mysterious country.
And when we did, my dad would say,
"Can you believe someone climbed a tree over there,
picked this thing off it, put it in a truck,
drove it all the way to the docks
and then sailed it all the way
across the Atlantic Ocean
and then put it in another truck
and drove that all the way to a tiny grocery store just outside our house,
so they could sell it to us for 25 cents?"
And I'd say, "I don't believe that."
And he's like, "I don't believe it either.
Things are amazing. There's just so many things to be happy about."
When I stop to think about it, he's absolutely right.
There are so many things to be happy about.
We are the only species
on the only life-giving rock
in the entire universe that we've ever seen,
capable of experiencing
so many of these things.
I mean, we're the only ones with architecture and agriculture.
We're the only ones with jewelry and democracy.
We've got airplanes, highway lanes,
interior design and horoscope signs.
We've got fashion magazines, house party scenes.
You can watch a horror movie with monsters.
You can go to a concert and hear guitars jamming.
We've got books, buffets and radio waves,
wedding brides and rollercoaster rides.
You can sleep in clean sheets.
You can go to the movies and get good seats.
You can smell bakery air, walk around with rain hair,
pop bubble wrap or take an illegal nap.
We've got all that,
but we've only got 100 years to enjoy it.
And that's the sad part.
The cashiers at your grocery store,
the foreman at your plant,
the guy tailgating you home on the highway,
the telemarketer calling you during dinner,
every teacher you've ever had,
everyone that's ever woken up beside you,
every politician in every country,
every actor in every movie,
every single person in your family, everyone you love,
everyone in this room and you
will be dead in a hundred years.
Life is so great that we only get such a short time
to experience and enjoy
all those tiny little moments that make it so sweet.
And that moment is right now,
and those moments are counting down,
and those moments are always, always, always fleeting.
You will never be as young as you are right now.
And that's why I believe that if you live your life
with a great attitude,
choosing to move forward and move on
whenever life deals you a blow,
living with a sense of awareness of the world around you,
embracing your inner three year-old
and seeing the tiny joys that make life so sweet
and being authentic to yourself,
being you and being cool with that,
letting your heart lead you and putting yourself in experiences that satisfy you,
then I think you'll live a life
that is rich and is satisfying,
and I think you'll live a life that is truly awesome.
Thank you.
Great creativity. In times of need, we need great creativity.
Discuss. Great creativity is astonishingly, absurdly, rationally, irrationally powerful.
Great creativity can spread tolerance, champion freedom,
make education seem like a bright idea.
(Laughter)
Great creativity can turn a spotlight on deprivation,
or show that deprivation ain't necessarily so.
Great creativity can make politicians electable,
or parties unelectable.
It can make war seem like tragedy or farce.
Creativity is the meme-maker that puts slogans on our t-shirts
and phrases on our lips.
It's the pathfinder that shows us a simple road
through an impenetrable moral maze.
Science is clever, but great creativity is something less knowable,
more magical. And now we need that magic.
This is a time of need.
Our climate is changing quickly, too quickly.
And great creativity is needed to do what it does so well:
to provoke us to think differently with dramatic creative statements.
To tempt us to act differently
with delightful creative scraps.
Here is one such scrap from an initiative I'm involved in
using creativity to inspire people to be greener.
(Video) Man: You know, rather than drive today, I'm going to walk.
Narrator: And so he walked, and as he walked he saw things.
Strange and wonderful things he would not otherwise have seen.
A deer with an itchy leg. A flying motorcycle.
A father and daughter separated from a bicycle by a mysterious wall.
And then he stopped. Walking in front of him was her.
The woman who as a child had skipped with him through fields
and broken his heart.
Sure, she had aged a little.
In fact, she had aged a lot.
But he felt all his old passion for her return.
"Ford," he called softly. For that was her name.
"Don't say another word, Gusty," she said,
for that was his name.
"I know a tent next to a caravan, exactly 300 yards from here.
Let's go there and make love. In the tent."
Ford undressed. She spread one leg, and then the other.
Gusty entered her boldly and made love to her rhythmically
while she filmed him, because she was a keen amateur pornographer.
The earth moved for both of them.
And they lived together happily ever after.
And all because he decided to walk that day.
(Applause)
Andy Hobsbawm: We've got the science, we've had the debate.
The moral imperative is on the table.
Great creativity is needed to take it all,
make it simple and sharp.
To make it connect. To make it make people want to act.
So this is a call, a plea,
to the incredibly talented TED community.
Let's get creative against climate change.
And let's do it soon. Thank you.
(Applause)
I was 14 years old
inside of a bowling alley,
burglarizing an arcade game,
and upon exiting the building
a security guard grabbed my arm, so I ran.
I ran down the street,
and I jumped on top of a fence.
And when I got to the top,
the weight of 3,000 quarters
in my book bag
pulled me back down to the ground.
So when I came to, the security guard
was standing on top of me,
and he said, "Next time you little punks
steal something you can carry."
(Laughter)
I was taken to juvenile hall
and when I was released
into the custody of my mother,
the first words my uncle said was,
"How'd you get caught?"
I said, "Man, the book bag was too heavy."
He said, "Man, you weren't supposed
to take all the quarters."
I said, "Man, they were small.
What am I supposed to do?"
And 10 minutes later, he took me
to burglarize another arcade game.
We needed gas money to get home.
That was my life.
I grew up in Oakland, California,
with my mother and members
of my immediate family
addicted to crack cocaine.
My environment consisted
of living with family, friends,
and homeless shelters.
Oftentimes, dinner was served
in breadlines and soup kitchens.
The big homey told me this:
money rules the world
and everything in it.
And in these streets, money is king.
And if you follow the money,
it'll lead you to the bad guy
or the good guy.
Soon after, I committed my first crime,
and it was the first time
that I was told that I had potential
and felt like somebody believed in me.
Nobody ever told me
that I could be a lawyer,
doctor or engineer.
I mean, how was I supposed to do that?
I couldn't read, write or spell.
I was illiterate.
So I always thought
crime was my way to go.
And then one day
I was talking to somebody
and he was telling me
about this robbery that we could do.
And we did it.
The reality was that I was growing up
in the strongest
financial nation in the world,
the United States of America,
while I watched my mother
stand in line at a blood bank
to sell her blood for 40 dollars
just to try to feed her kids.
She still has the needle marks
on her arms to day to show for that.
So I never cared about my community.
They didn't care about my life.
Everybody there was doing what they
were doing to take what they wanted,
the drug dealers,
the robbers, the blood bank.
Everybody was taking blood money.
So I got mine by any means necessary.
I got mine.
Financial literacy
really did rule the world,
and I was a child slave to it
following the bad guy.
At 17 years old, I was arrested
for robbery and murder
and I soon learned that finances in prison
rule more than they did on the streets,
so I wanted in.
One day, I rushed to grab
the sports page of the newspaper
so my cellie could read it to me,
and I accidentally
picked up the business section.
And this old man said,
"Hey youngster, you pick stocks?"
And I said, "What's that?"
He said, "That's the place
where white folks keep all their money."
(Laughter)
And it was the first time
that I saw a glimpse of hope,
a future.
He gave me this brief description
of what stocks were,
but it was just a glimpse.
I mean, how was I supposed to do it?
I couldn't read, write or spell.
The skills that I had developed
to hide my illiteracy
no longer worked in this environment.
I was trapped in a cage,
prey among predators,
fighting for freedom I never had.
I was lost, tired,
and I was out of options.
So at 20 years old,
I did the hardest thing
I'd ever done in my life.
I picked up a book,
and it was the most agonizing
time of my life,
trying to learn how to read,
the ostracizing from my family,
the homeys.
It was rough, man.
It was a struggle.
But little did I know
I was receiving the greatest gifts
I had ever dreamed of:
self-worth,
knowledge, discipline.
I was so excited to be reading that I read
everything I could get my hands on:
candy wrappers, clothing logos,
street signs, everything.
I was just reading stuff!
(Applause)
Just reading stuff.
I was so excited to know how to read
and know how to spell.
The homey came up, said,
"Man, what you eating?"
I said, "C-A-N-D-Y, candy."
(Laughter)
He said, "Let me get some."
I said, "N-O. No."
(Laughter)
It was awesome.
I mean, I can actually now
for the first time in my life read.
The feeling that I got
from it was amazing.
And then at 22, feeling myself,
feeling confident,
I remembered what the OG told me.
So I picked up the business section
of the newspaper.
I wanted to find these rich white folks.
(Laughter)
So I looked for that glimpse.
As I furthered my career
in teaching others how to
financially manage money and invest,
I soon learned that I had to take
responsibility for my own actions.
True, I grew up
in a very complex environment,
but I chose to commit crimes,
and I had to own up to that.
I had to take responsibility
for that, and I did.
I was building a curriculum
that could teach incarcerated men
how to manage money
through prison employments.
Properly managing our lifestyle
would provide transferrable tools
that we can use to manage money
when we reenter society,
like the majority of people did
who didn't commit crimes.
Then I discovered
that according to MarketWatch,
over 60 percent of the American population
has under 1,000 dollars in savings.
Sports Illustrated said that
over 60 percent of NBA players
and NFL players go broke.
40 percent of marital problems
derive from financial issues.
What the hell?
(Laughter)
You mean to tell me
that people worked their whole lives,
buying cars, clothes,
homes and material stuff
but were living check to check?
How in the world were members of society
going to help incarcerated individuals
back into society
if they couldn't manage they own stuff?
We screwed.
(Laughter)
I needed a better plan.
This is not going to work out too well.
So ...
I thought.
I now had an obligation
to meet those on the path
and help,
and it was crazy because
I now cared about my community.
Wow, imagine that.
I cared about my community.
Financial illiteracy is a disease
that has crippled minorities
and the lower class in our society
for generations and generations,
and we should be furious about that.
Ask yourselves this:
How can 50 percent
of the American population
be financially illiterate in a nation
driven by financial prosperity?
Our access to justice, our social status,
living conditions, transportation and food
are all dependent on money
that most people can't manage.
It's crazy!
It's an epidemic
and a bigger danger to public safety
than any other issue.
According to the California
Department of Corrections,
over 70 percent of those incarcerated
have committed or have been charged
with money-related crimes:
robberies, burglaries,
fraud, larceny, extortion --
and the list goes on.
Check this out:
a typical incarcerated person
would enter the California prison system
with no financial education,
earn 30 cents an hour,
over 800 dollars a year,
with no real expenses and save no money.
Upon his parole, he will be given
200 dollars gate money and told,
"Hey, good luck, stay out of trouble.
Don't come back to prison."
With no meaningful preparation
or long-term financial plan,
what does he do ... ?
At 60?
Get a good job,
or go back to the very criminal behavior
that led him to prison in the first place?
You taxpayers, you choose.
Well, his education
already chose for him, probably.
So how do we cure this disease?
I cofounded a program
that we call Financial Empowerment
Emotional Literacy.
We call it FEEL,
and it teaches how do you separate
your emotional decisions
from your financial decisions,
and the four timeless rules
to personal finance:
the proper way to save,
control your cost of living,
borrow money effectively
and diversify your finances
by allowing your money to work for you
instead of you working for it.
Incarcerated people need these life skills
before we reenter society.
You can't have full rehabilitation
without these life skills.
This idea that only professionals
can invest and manage money
is absolutely ridiculous,
and whoever told you that is lying.
(Applause)
A professional is a person
who knows his craft better than most,
and nobody knows how much money
you need, have or want better than you,
which means you are the professional.
Financial literacy is not a skill,
ladies and gentlemen.
It's a lifestyle.
Financial stability is a byproduct
of a proper lifestyle.
A financially sound incarcerated person
can become a taxpaying citizen,
and a financially sound
taxpaying citizen can remain one.
This allows us to create a bridge
between those people who we influence:
family, friends and those young people
who still believe
that crime and money are related.
So let's lose the fear and anxiety
of all the big financial words
and all that other nonsense
that you've been out there hearing.
And let's get to the heart
of what's been crippling our society
from taking care of your responsibility
to be better life managers.
And let's provide a simple
and easy to use curriculum
that gets to the heart, the heart
of what financial empowerment
and emotional literacy really is.
Now, if you're sitting out here
in the audience and you said,
"Oh yeah, well, that ain't me
and I don't buy it,"
then come take my class --
(Laughter)
so I can show you how much money
it costs you every time you get emotional.
(Applause)
Thank you very much. Thank you.
(Applause)
I would like to share with you
a new model of higher education,
a model that, once expanded,
can enhance the collective intelligence
of millions of creative
and motivated individuals
that otherwise would be left behind.
Look at the world.
Pick a place and focus on it.
You will find humans
chasing higher education.
Let's meet some of them.
Patrick.
Patrick was born in Liberia
to a family of 20 children.
During the civil war,
he and his family were forced
to flee to Nigeria.
There, in spite of his situation,
he graduated high school
with nearly perfect grades.
He wanted to continue to higher education,
but due to his family
living on the poverty line,
he was soon sent to South Africa
to work and send back money
to feed his family.
Patrick never gave up his dream
of higher education.
Late at night, after work,
he surfed the net,
looking for ways to study.
Meet Debbie.
Debbie is from Florida.
Her parents didn't go to college,
and neither did any of her siblings.
Debbie has worked all her life,
pays taxes, supports herself
month to month,
proud of the American dream,
a dream that just won't be complete
without higher education.
But Debbie doesn't have the savings
for higher education.
She can't pay the tuition.
Neither could she leave work.
Meet Wael.
Wael is from Syria.
He's experiencing firsthand
the misery, fear and failure
imposed on his country.
He's a big believer in education.
He knew that if he could find
an opportunity for higher education,
an opportunity to get ahead of the rest,
he has a better chance to survive
in a world turned upside down.
The higher education system
failed Patrick, Debbie and Wael,
exactly as it is failing
millions of potential students --
millions that graduate high school,
millions that are qualified
for higher education,
millions that want to study
yet cannot access it for various reasons.
First: financial.
Universities are expensive;
we all know it.
In large parts of the world,
higher education is unattainable
for an average citizen.
This is probably the biggest problem
facing our society.
Higher education stopped
being a right for all
and became a privilege for the few.
Second: cultural.
Students who are qualified
for higher education
can afford -- want to study -- cannot,
because it is not decent,
it is not a place for a woman.
This is the story of countless women
in Africa, for example,
prevented from higher education
because of cultural barriers.
And here comes the third reason:
UNESCO stated that in 2025,
100 million students will be deprived
of higher education,
simply because there will not be enough
seats to accommodate them,
to meet the demand.
They will take a placement test,
they will pass it,
but they still won't have access,
because there are no places available.
These are the reasons
I founded University of the People,
a nonprofit, tuition-free,
degree-granting university
to give an alternative,
to create an alternative,
to those who have no other;
an alternative that will be
affordable and scalable,
an alternative that will disrupt
the current education system,
and open the gates to higher education
for every qualified student
regardless of what they earn,
where they live,
or what society says about them.
Patrick, Debbie and Wael
are only three examples
out of the 1,700 accepted students
from 143 countries.
(Applause)
Thank you.
(Applause)
We didn't need to reinvent the wheel.
We just looked at what wasn't working
and used the amazing power of the Internet
to get around it.
We set out to build a model
that will cut down almost entirely
the cost of higher education.
And that's how we did it.
First, bricks and mortar cost money.
Universities have expenses
that virtual universities don't.
We don't need to pass these expenses
on to our students.
They don't exist.
We also don't need
to worry about capacity.
There are no limits of seats
in virtual university.
Actually, nobody needs to stand
at the back of the lecture hall.
Textbooks are also something
our students don't need to buy.
By using open educational resources
and the generosity of professors
who are putting their material up
free and accessible,
we don't need to send
our students to buy textbooks.
All of our materials come free.
Even professors,
the most expensive line
in any university balance sheet,
come free to our students.
Over 3,000 of them,
including presidents, vice chancellors,
professors and academic advisers
from top universities such as NYU,
Yale, Berkeley and Oxford,
came on board to help our students.
Finally, is our belief
in peer-to-peer learning.
We use this sound pedagogical model
to encourage our students
from all over the world
to interact and study together,
and also to reduce the time
our professors need
to labor over class assignments.
If the Internet has made us
a global village,
this model can develop
its future leadership.
Look how we do it.
We only offer two programs:
business administration
and computer science,
the two programs most in demand worldwide,
the two programs that are likeliest
to help our students find a job.
When our students are accepted,
they are placed in a small classroom
of 20 to 30 students,
to ensure that those who need
personalized attention get it.
Moreover, for every nine-week course,
they meet a new peer,
a whole new set of students
from all over the world.
Every week, when they go
into the classroom,
they find the lecture notes of the week,
the reading assignment,
the homework assignment,
and the discussion question,
which is the core of our studies.
Every week, every student must contribute
to the class discussion,
and also must comment
on the contribution of others.
This way, we open our students' minds,
we develop a positive shift in attitude
toward different cultures.
By the end of each week,
the students take a quiz,
hand in their homework,
which are assessed by their peers
under the supervision of the instructors,
get a grade, move to the next week.
By the end of the course,
they take the final exam,
get a grade, and follow
to the next course.
We open the gates for higher education
for every qualified student.
Every student with a high school diploma,
sufficient English and Internet connection
can study with us.
We don't use audio, we don't use video.
Broadband is not necessary.
Any student from any part of the world
with any Internet connection
can study with us.
We are tuition free.
All we ask our students to cover
is the cost of their exams,
100 dollars per exam.
A full-time bachelor's degree
student taking 40 courses
will pay 1,000 dollars a year,
4,000 dollars for the entire degree.
And for those who cannot afford even this,
we offer them a variety of scholarships.
It is our mission that nobody
will be left behind
for financial reasons.
With 5,000 students in 2016,
this model is financially sustainable.
Five years ago, it was a vision.
Today, it is a reality.
Last month, we got the ultimate
academic endorsement to our model.
University of the People
is now fully accredited.
(Applause)
Thank you.
(Applause)
With this accreditation,
it's our time now to scale up.
We have demonstrated that our model works.
I invite universities
and, even more important,
developing countries' governments,
to replicate this model
to ensure that the gates of higher
education will open widely.
A new era is coming --
an era that will witness the disruption
of the higher education model
as we know it today,
from being a privilege for the few
to becoming a basic right,
affordable and accessible for all.
Thank you.
(Applause)
I would like to talk today
about what I think is one of the greatest adventures
human beings have embarked upon,
which is the quest to understand the universe
and our place in it.
My own interest in this subject, and my passion for it,
began rather accidentally.
I had bought a copy of this book,
"The Universe and Dr. Einstein" --
a used paperback from a secondhand bookstore in Seattle.
A few years after that, in Bangalore,
I was finding it hard to fall asleep one night,
and I picked up this book,
thinking it would put me to sleep in 10 minutes.
And as it happened,
I read it from midnight to five in the morning in one shot.
And I was left with this intense feeling
of awe and exhilaration
at the universe
and our own ability to understand as much as we do.
And that feeling hasn't left me yet.
That feeling was the trigger for me
to actually change my career --
from being a software engineer to become a science writer --
so that I could partake in the joy of science,
and also the joy of communicating it to others.
And that feeling also led me
to a pilgrimage of sorts,
to go literally to the ends of the earth
to see telescopes, detectors,
instruments that people are building, or have built,
in order to probe the cosmos
in greater and greater detail.
So it took me from places like Chile --
the Atacama Desert in Chile --
to Siberia,
to underground mines
in the Japanese Alps, in Northern America,
all the way to Antarctica
and even to the South Pole.
And today I would like to share with you
some images, some stories of these trips.
I have been basically spending the last few years
documenting the efforts
of some extremely intrepid men and women
who are putting,
literally at times, their lives at stake
working in some very remote and very hostile places
so that they may gather the faintest signals from the cosmos
in order for us to understand this universe.
And I first begin with a pie chart --
and I promise this is the only pie chart
in the whole presentation --
but it sets up the state of our knowledge of the cosmos.
All the theories in physics that we have today
properly explain what is called normal matter --
the stuff that we're all made of --
and that's four percent of the universe.
Astronomers and cosmologists and physicists think
that there is something called dark matter in the universe,
which makes up 23 percent of the universe,
and something called dark energy,
which permeates the fabric of space-time,
that makes up another 73 percent.
So if you look at this pie chart, 96 percent of the universe,
at this point in our exploration of it,
is unknown or not well understood.
And most of the experiments, telescopes that I went to see
are in some way addressing this question,
these two twin mysteries of dark matter and dark energy.
I will take you first to an underground mine
in Northern Minnesota
where people are looking
for something called dark matter.
And the idea here is that they are looking for a sign
of a dark matter particle hitting one of their detectors.
And the reason why they have to go underground
is that, if you did this experiment on the surface of the Earth,
the same experiment would be swamped by signals
that could be created by things like cosmic rays,
ambient radio activity,
even our own bodies. You might not believe it,
but even our own bodies are radioactive enough to disturb this experiment.
So they go deep inside mines
to find a kind of environmental silence
that will allow them to hear
the ping of a dark matter particle hitting their detector.
And I went to see one of these experiments,
and this is actually -- you can barely see it,
and the reason for that is it's entirely dark in there --
this is a cavern that was left behind by the miners
who left this mine in 1960.
And physicists came and started using it
sometime in the 1980s.
And the miners in the early part of the last century
worked, literally, in candlelight.
And today, you would see this inside the mine,
half a mile underground.
This is one of the largest underground labs in the world.
And, among other things, they're looking for dark matter.
There is another way to search for dark matter,
which is indirectly.
If dark matter exists in our universe,
in our galaxy,
then these particles should be smashing together
and producing other particles that we know about --
one of them being neutrinos.
And neutrinos you can detect
by the signature they leave
when they hit water molecules.
When a neutrino hits a water molecule
it emits a kind of blue light,
a flash of blue light,
and by looking for this blue light,
you can essentially understand something about the neutrino
and then, indirectly, something about the dark matter
that might have created this neutrino.
But you need very, very large volumes of water
in order to do this.
You need something like tens of megatons of water --
almost a gigaton of water --
in order to have any chance of catching this neutrino.
And where in the world would you find such water?
Well the Russians have a tank in their own backyard.
This is Lake Baikal.
It is the largest lake in the world. It's 800 km long.
It's about 40 to 50 km wide
in most places,
and one to two kilometers deep.
And what the Russians are doing
is they're building these detectors
and immersing them about a kilometer beneath the surface of the lake
so that they can watch for these flashes of blue light.
And this is the scene that greeted me when I landed there.
This is Lake Baikal
in the peak of the Siberian winter.
The lake is entirely frozen.
And the line of black dots
that you see in the background,
that's the ice camp where the physicists are working.
The reason why they have to work in winter
is because they don't have the money to work in summer and spring,
which, if they did that,
they would need ships and submersibles to do their work.
So they wait until winter --
the lake is completely frozen over --
and they use this meter-thick ice
as a platform on which to establish their ice camp and do their work.
So this is the Russians working on the ice
in the peak of the Siberian winter.
They have to drill holes in the ice,
dive down into the water -- cold, cold water --
to get hold of the instrument, bring it up,
do any repairs and maintenance that they need to do,
put it back and get out before the ice melts.
Because that phase of solid ice lasts for two months
and it's full of cracks.
And you have to imagine, there's an entire sea-like lake
underneath, moving.
I still don't understand this one Russian man
working in his bare chest,
but that tells you how hard he was working.
And these people, a handful of people,
have been working for 20 years,
looking for particles that may or may not exist.
And they have dedicated their lives to it.
And just to give you an idea,
they have spent 20 million over 20 years.
It's very harsh conditions.
They work on a shoestring budget.
The toilets there are literally holes in the ground
covered with a wooden shack.
And it's that basic,
but they do this every year.
From Siberia to the Atacama Desert in Chile,
to see something called The Very Large Telescope.
The Very Large Telescope
is one of these things that astronomers do --
they name their telescopes rather unimaginatively.
I can tell you for a fact,
that the next one that they're planning is called The Extremely Large Telescope.
(Laughter)
And you wouldn't believe it,
but the one after that is going to be called The Overwhelmingly Large Telescope.
But nonetheless,
it's an extraordinary piece of engineering.
These are four 8.2 meter telescopes.
And these telescopes, among other things,
they're being used to study
how the expansion of the universe is changing with time.
And the more you understand that,
the better you would understand
what this dark energy that the universe is made of is all about.
And one piece of engineering that I want to leave you with
as regards this telescope
is the mirror.
Each mirror, there are four of them,
is made of a single piece of glass,
a monolithic piece of high-tech ceramic,
that has been ground down and polished to such accuracy
that the only way to understand what that is
is [to] imagine a city like Paris,
with all its buildings and the Eiffel Tower,
if you grind down Paris to that kind of accuracy,
you would be left with bumps that are one millimeter high.
And that's the kind of polishing that these mirrors have endured.
An extraordinary set of telescopes.
Here's another view of the same.
The reason why you have to build these telescopes
in places like the Atacama Desert
is because of the high altitude desert.
The dry air is really good for telescopes,
and also, the cloud cover is below the summit of these mountains
so that the telescopes have
about 300 days of clear skies.
Finally, I want to take you to Antarctica.
I want to spend most of my time on this part of the world.
This is cosmology's final frontier.
Some of the most amazing experiments,
some of the most extreme experiments,
are being done in Antarctica.
I was there to view something called a long-duration balloon flight,
which basically takes telescopes and instruments
all the way to the upper atmosphere,
the upper stratosphere, 40 km up.
And that's where they do their experiments,
and then the balloon, the payload, is brought down.
So this is us landing on the Ross Ice Shelf in Antarctica.
That's an American C-17 cargo plane
that flew us from New Zealand
to McMurdo in Antarctica.
And here we are about to board our bus.
And I don't know if you can read the lettering,
but it says, "Ivan the Terribus."
And that's taking us to McMurdo.
And this is the scene that greets you in McMurdo.
And you barely might be able to make out
this hut here.
This hut was built by Robert Falcon Scott and his men
when they first came to Antarctica
on their first expedition to go to the South Pole.
Because it's so cold,
the entire contents of that hut is still as they left it,
with the remnants of the last meal they cooked still there.
It's an extraordinary place.
This is McMurdo itself. About a thousand people work here in summer,
and about 200 in winter
when it's completely dark for six months.
I was here to see the launch
of this particular type of instrument.
This is a cosmic ray experiment
that has been launched all the way to the upper-stratosphere
to an altitude of 40 km.
What I want you to imagine is this is two tons in weight.
So you're using a balloon
to carry something that is two tons
all the way to an altitude of 40 km.
And the engineers, the technicians, the physicists
have all got to assemble on the Ross Ice Shelf,
because Antarctica -- I won't go into the reasons why --
but it's one of the most favorable places for doing these balloon launches,
except for the weather.
The weather, as you can imagine,
this is summer, and you're standing on 200 ft of ice.
And there's a volcano behind,
which has glaciers at the very top.
And what they have to do
is they have to assemble the entire balloon --
the fabric, parachute and everything -- on the ice
and then fill it up with helium.
And that process takes about two hours.
And the weather can change as they're putting together this whole assembly.
For instance, here they are laying down the balloon fabric behind,
which is eventually going to be filled up with helium.
Those two trucks you see at the very end
carry 12 tanks each of compressed helium.
Now, in case the weather changes before the launch,
they have to actually pack everything back up into their boxes
and take it out back to McMurdo Station.
And this particular balloon,
because it has to launch two tons of weight,
is an extremely huge balloon.
The fabric alone weighs two tons.
In order to minimize the weight,
it's very thin, it's as thin as a sandwich wrapper.
And if they have to pack it back,
they have to put it into boxes
and stamp on it so that it fits into the box again --
except, when they did it first,
it would have been done in Texas.
Here, they can't do it with the kind shoes they're wearing,
so they have to take their shoes off,
get barefoot into the boxes, in this cold,
and do that kind of work.
That's the kind of dedication these people have.
Here's the balloon being filled up with helium,
and you can see it's a gorgeous sight.
Here's a scene
that shows you the balloon and the payload end-to-end.
So the balloon is being filled up with helium on the left-hand side,
and the fabric actually runs all the way to the middle
where there's a piece of electronics and explosives
being connected to a parachute,
and then the parachute is then connected to the payload.
And remember, all this wiring is being done
by people in extreme cold, in sub-zero temperatures.
They're wearing about 15 kg of clothing and stuff,
but they have to take their gloves off in order to do that.
And I would like to share with you a launch.
(Video) Radio: Okay, release the balloon,
release the balloon, release the balloon.
Anil Ananthaswamy: And I'll finally like to leave you with two images.
This is an observatory in the Himalayas, in Ladakh in India.
And the thing I want you to look at here
is the telescope on the right-hand side.
And on the far left there
is a 400 year-old Buddhist monastery.
This is a close-up of the Buddhist monastery.
And I was struck by the juxtaposition
of these two enormous disciplines that humanity has.
One is exploring the cosmos on the outside,
and the other one is exploring our interior being.
And both require silence of some sort.
And what struck me was
every place that I went to to see these telescopes,
the astronomers and cosmologists
are in search of a certain kind of silence,
whether it's silence from radio pollution
or light pollution or whatever.
And it was very obvious
that, if we destroy these silent places on Earth,
we will be stuck on a planet without the ability to look outwards,
because we will not be able to understand the signals that come from outer space.
Thank you.
(Applause)
From all outward appearances,
John had everything going for him.
He had just signed the contract
to sell his New York apartment
at a six-figure profit,
and he'd only owned it for five years.
The school where he graduated from with his master's
had just offered him a teaching appointment,
which meant not only a salary,
but benefits for the first time in ages.
And yet, despite everything going really well for John,
he was struggling,
fighting addiction and a gripping depression.
On the night of June 11th, 2003,
he climbed up to the edge
of the fence on the Manhattan Bridge
and he leaped to the treacherous waters below.
Remarkably --
no, miraculously --
he lived.
The fall shattered his right arm,
broke every rib that he had,
punctured his lung,
and he drifted in and out of consciousness
as he drifted down the East River,
under the Brooklyn Bridge
and out into the pathway of the Staten Island Ferry,
where passengers on the ferry
heard his cries of pain,
contacted the boat's captain
who contacted the Coast Guard
who fished him out of the East River
and took him to Bellevue Hospital.
And that's actually where our story begins.
Because once John committed himself
to putting his life back together --
first physically, then emotionally,
and then spiritually --
he found that there were very few resources available
to someone who has attempted to end their life
in the way that he did.
Research shows
that 19 out of 20 people
who attempt suicide
will fail.
But the people who fail
are 37 times more likely to succeed
the second time.
This truly is
an at-risk population
with very few resources to support them.
And what happens
when people try to assemble themselves back into life,
because of our taboos around suicide,
we're not sure what to say,
and so quite often we say nothing.
And that furthers the isolation
that people like John found themselves in.
I know John's story very well
because I'm John.
And this is, today,
the first time in any sort of public setting
I've ever acknowledged
the journey that I have been on.
But after having lost a beloved teacher in 2006
and a good friend last year to suicide,
and sitting last year at TEDActive,
I knew that I needed to step out of my silence
and past my taboos
to talk about an idea worth spreading --
and that is that people
who have made the difficult choice
to come back to life
need more resources and need our help.
As the Trevor Project says, it gets better.
It gets way better.
And I'm choosing to come out
of a totally different kind of closet today
to encourage you, to urge you,
that if you are someone
who has contemplated or attempted suicide,
or you know somebody who has,
talk about it; get help.
It's a conversation worth having
and an idea worth spreading.
Thank you.
(Applause)
I remember the first time
that I saw people injecting drugs.
I had just arrived in Vancouver
to lead a research project
in HIV prevention in the
infamous Downtown East Side.
It was in the lobby of the Portland Hotel,
a supportive housing
project that gave rooms
to the most marginalized
people in the city,
the so-called "difficult to house."
I'll never forget the young woman
standing on the stairs
repeatedly jabbing herself with a needle,
and screaming,
"I can't find a vein,"
as blood splattered on the wall.
In response to the desperate
state of affairs, the drug use,
the poverty, the violence,
the soaring rates of HIV,
Vancouver declared a public
health emergency in 1997.
This opened the door to
expanding harm reduction services,
distributing more needles,
increasing access to methadone,
and, finally, opening
a supervised injection site.
Things that make injecting
drugs less hazardous.
But today, 20 years later,
harm reduction is still viewed
as some sort of radical concept.
In some places, it's still illegal
to carry a clean needle.
Drug users are far more likely
to be arrested
than to be offered methadone therapy.
Recent proposals for
supervised injection sites
in cities like Seattle,
Baltimore and New York
have been met with stiff opposition:
opposition that goes against
everything we know about addiction.
Why is that?
Why are we still stuck on the idea
that the only option is to stop using --
that any drug use will not be tolerated?
Why do we ignore
countless personal stories
and overwhelming scientific evidence
that harm reduction works?
Critics say that harm
reduction doesn't stop people
from using illegal drugs.
Well, actually, that is the whole point.
After every criminal and societal sanction
that we can come up with,
people still use drugs,
and far too many die.
Critics also say that
we are giving up on people
by not focusing our attention
on treatment and recovery.
In fact, it is just the opposite.
We are not giving up on people.
We know that if recovery
is ever going to happen
we must keep people alive.
Offering someone a clean needle
or a safe place to inject
is the first step to
treatment and recovery.
Critics also claim that harm reduction
gives the wrong message to
our children about drug users.
The last time I looked,
these drug users are our children.
The message of harm reduction
is that while drugs can hurt you,
we still must reach out to
people who are addicted.
A needle exchange is not an
advertisement for drug use.
Neither is a methadone clinic
or a supervised injection site.
What you see there are
people sick and hurting,
hardly an endorsement for drug use.
Let's take supervised
injection sites, for example.
Probably the most misunderstood
health intervention ever.
All we are saying is that allowing people
to inject in a clean, dry space
with fresh needles,
surrounded by people who care
is a lot better than
injecting in a dingy alley,
sharing contaminated needles
and hiding out from police.
It's better for everybody.
The first supervised injection site
in Vancouver was at 327 Carol Street,
a narrow room with a concrete floor,
a few chairs and a box of clean needles.
The police would often lock it down,
but somehow it always
mysteriously reopened,
often with the aid of a crowbar.
I would go down there some evenings
to provide medical care
for people who were injecting drugs.
I was always struck with the
commitment and compassion
of the people who operated
and used the site.
No judgment, no hassles, no fear,
lots of profound conversation.
I learned that despite
unimaginable trauma,
physical pain and mental illness,
that everyone there thought
that things would get better.
Most were convinced that, someday,
they'd stop using drugs altogether.
That room was the forerunner
to North America's
first government-sanctioned
supervised injection site, called INSITE.
It opened in September of 2003
as a three-year research project.
The conservative government was intent on
closing it down at the end of the study.
After eight years,
the battle to close INSITE
went all the way up to
Canada's Supreme Court.
It pitted the government of Canada
against two people with a
long history of drug use
who knew the benefits of INSITE firsthand:
Dean Wilson and Shelley Tomic.
The court ruled in favor
of keeping INSITE open by nine to zero.
The justices were scathing in
their response to the government's case.
And I quote:
"The effect of denying the services
of INSITE to the population that it serves
and the correlative increase in the risk
of death and disease
to injection drug users
is grossly disproportionate to any benefit
that Canada might derive
from presenting a uniform stance
on the possession of narcotics."
This was a hopeful moment
for harm reduction.
Yet, despite this strong message
from the Supreme Court,
it was, until very recently,
impossible to open up
any new sites in Canada.
There was one interesting thing
that happened in December of 2016,
when due to the overdose crisis,
the government of British Columbia allowed
the opening of overdose prevention sites.
Essentially ignoring the
federal approval process,
community groups opened up
about 22 of these de facto illegal
supervised injection sites
across the province.
Virtually overnight,
thousands of people could
use drugs under supervision.
Hundreds of overdoses were reversed
by Naloxone, and nobody died.
In fact, this is what's happened
at INSITE over the last 14 years:
75,000 different individuals
have injected illegal drugs
more than three and a half million times,
and not one person has died.
Nobody has ever died at INSITE.
So there you have it.
We have scientific evidence
and successes from needle exchanges
methadone and supervised injection sites.
These are common-sense,
compassionate approaches to drug use
that improve health, bring connection
and greatly reduce suffering and death.
So why haven't harm reduction
programs taken off?
Why do we still think
that drug use is law enforcement issue?
Our disdain for drugs and
drug users goes very deep.
We are bombarded with
images and media stories
about the horrible impacts of drugs.
We have stigmatized entire communities.
We applaud military-inspired operations
that bring down drug dealers.
And we appear unfazed
by building more jails
to incarcerate people whose
only crime is using drugs.
Virtually millions of people are caught up
in a hopeless cycle
of incarceration, violence and poverty
that has been created by our drug laws
and not the drugs themselves.
How do I explain to people
that drug users deserve care and support
and the freedom to live their lives
when all we see are images of guns
and handcuffs and jail cells?
Let's be clear:
criminalization is just a way
to institutionalize stigma.
Making drugs illegal does nothing
to stop people from using them.
Our paralysis to see things differently
is also based on an entirely
false narrative about drug use.
We have been led to believe
that drug users
are irresponsible people who just
want to get high,
and then through their
own personal failings
spiral down into a life
of crime and poverty,
losing their jobs, their families
and, ultimately, their lives.
In reality, most drug users have a story,
whether it's childhood trauma,
sexual abuse, mental illness
or a personal tragedy.
The drugs are used to numb the pain.
We must understand that
as we approach people with so much trauma.
At its core, our drug policies
are really a social justice issue.
While the media may focus on overdose
deaths like Prince and Michael Jackson,
the majority of the suffering
happens to people who are
living on the margins,
the poor and the dispossessed.
They don't vote; they are often alone.
They are society's disposable people.
Even within health care,
drug use is highly stigmatized.
People using drugs avoid
the health care system.
They know that once
engaged in clinical care
or admitted to hospital,
they will be treated poorly.
And their supply line, be it heroin,
cocaine or crystal meth
will be interrupted.
On top of that, they will be asked
a barrage of questions
that only serve
to expose their losses and shame.
"What drugs do you use?"
"How long have you been
living on the street?"
"Where are your children?"
"When were you last in jail?"
Essentially: "Why the hell
don't you stop using drugs?"
In fact, our entire medical
approach to drug use is upside down.
For some reason,
we have decided that abstinence
is the best way to treat this.
If you're lucky enough,
you may get into a detox program.
If you live in a community
with Suboxone or methadone,
you may get on a substitution program.
Hardly ever would we offer people
what they desperately need to survive:
a safe prescription for opioids.
Starting with abstinence is
like asking a new diabetic to quit sugar
or a severe asthmatic
to start running marathons
or a depressed person to just be happy.
For any other medical condition,
we would never start with
the most extreme option.
What makes us think that strategy
would work for something
as complex as addiction?
While unintentional overdoses are not new,
the scale of the current
crisis is unprecedented.
The Center for Disease Control estimated
that 64,000 Americans died
of a drug overdose in 2016,
far exceeding car crashes or homicides.
Drug-related mortality is now
the leading cause of death
among men and women between
20 and 50 years old in North America
Think about that.
How did we get to this point, and why now?
There is a kind of perfect
storm around opioids.
Drugs like Oxycontin,
Percocet and Dilaudid
have been liberally distributed
for decades for all kinds of pain.
It is estimated that two million
Americans are daily opioid users,
and over 60 million people
received at least one prescription
for opioids last year.
This massive dump of
prescription drugs into communities
has provided a steady source
for people wanting to self-medicate.
In response to this prescription epidemic,
people have been cut off, and this
has greatly reduced the street supply
The unintended but predictable consequence
is an overdose epidemic.
Many people who were reliant on
a steady supply of prescription drugs
turned to heroin.
And now the illegal drug market
has tragically switched
to synthetic drugs, mainly fentanyl.
These new drugs are cheap,
potent and extremely hard to dose.
People are literally being poisoned.
Can you imagine if this was
any other kind of poisoning epidemic?
What if thousands of people started dying
from poisoned meat
or baby formula or coffee?
We would be treating
this as a true emergency.
We would immediately be
supplying safer alternatives.
There would be changes in legislation,
and we would be supporting
the victims and their families.
But for the drug overdose epidemic,
we have done none of that.
We continue to demonize the drugs
and the people who use them
and blindly pour even more resources
into law enforcement.
So where should we go from here?
First, we should fully embrace,
fund and scale up
harm reduction programs
across North America.
I know that in places like Vancouver,
harm reduction has been a
lifeline to care and treatment.
I know that the number of overdose deaths
would be far higher
without harm reduction.
And I personally know hundreds
of people who are alive today
because of harm reduction.
But harm reduction is just the start.
If we truly want to make
an impact on this drug crisis,
we need to have a serious
conversation about prohibition
and criminal punishment.
We need to recognize that drug use is
first and foremost a public health issue
and turn to comprehensive social
and health solutions.
We already have a model
for how this can work.
In 2001, Portugal was
having its own drug crisis.
Lots of people using
drugs, high crime rates
and an overdose epidemic.
They defied global conventions
and decriminalized all drug possession.
Money that was spent on drug enforcement
was redirected to health
and rehabilitation programs.
The results are in.
Overall drug use is down dramatically.
Overdoses are uncommon.
Many more people are in treatment.
And people have been
given their lives back.
We have come so far down the road
of prohibition, punishment and prejudice
that we have become
indifferent to the suffering
that we have inflicted on the
most vulnerable people in our society.
This year even more
people will get caught up
in the illegal drug trade.
Thousands of children will learn
that their mother or father
has been sent to jail for using drugs.
And far too many parents will be notified
that their son or daughter
has died of a drug overdose.
It doesn't have to be this way.
Thank you.
(Applause)
The brain is an amazing and complex organ.
And while many people
are fascinated by the brain,
they can't really tell you that much
about the properties
about how the brain works
because we don't teach
neuroscience in schools.
And one of the reasons
why is that the equipment
is so complex and so expensive
that it's really only done at major
universities and large institutions.
And so in order to be able
to access the brain,
you really need to dedicate your life
and spend six and a half years
as a graduate student
just to become a neuroscientist
to get access to these tools.
And that's a shame
because one out of five of us,
that's 20 percent of the entire world,
will have a neurological disorder.
And there are zero cures
for these diseases.
And so it seems that
what we should be doing
is reaching back earlier
in the eduction process
and teaching students about neuroscience
so that in the future,
they may be thinking about possibly
becoming a brain scientist.
When I was a graduate student,
my lab mate Tim Marzullo and myself,
decided that what if we took
this complex equipment that we have
for studying the brain and made it simple
enough and affordable enough
that anyone that you know, an amateur
or a high school student,
could learn and actually participate
in the discovery of neuroscience.
And so we did just that.
A few years ago, we started
a company called Backyard Brains
and we make DIY neuroscience equipment
and I brought some here tonight,
and I want to do some demonstrations.
You guys want to see some?
So I need a volunteer.
So right before -- what is your name?
(Applause)
Sam Kelly: Sam.
Greg Gage: All right, Sam, I'm going
to record from your brain.
Have you had this before?
SK: No.
GG: I need you to stick out
your arm for science,
roll up your sleeve a bit,
So what I'm going to do,
I'm putting electrodes on your arm,
and you're probably wondering,
I just said I'm going to record from your
brain, what am I doing with your arm?
Well, you have about 80 billion neurons
inside your brain right now.
They're sending electrical messages
back and forth, and chemical messages.
But some of your neurons
right here in your motor cortex
are going to send messages down
when you move your arm like this.
They're going to go down
across your corpus callosum,
down onto your spinal cord
to your lower motor neuron
out to your muscles here,
and that electrical discharge
is going to be picked up
by these electrodes right here
and we're going to be able to listen
to exactly what your brain
is going to be doing.
So I'm going to turn this on for a second.
Have you ever heard
what your brain sounds like?
SK: No.
GG: Let's try it out.
So go ahead and squeeze your hand.
(Rumbling)
So what you're listening to,
so this is your motor units
happening right here.
Let's take a look at it as well.
So I'm going to stand over here,
and I'm going to open up our app here.
So now I want you to squeeze.
(Rumbling)
So right here, these are the motor units
that are happening
from her spinal cord
out to her muscle right here,
and as she's doing it,
you're seeing the electrical activity
that's happening here.
You can even click here
and try to see one of them.
So keep doing it really hard.
So now we've paused
on one motor action potential that's
happening right now inside of your brain.
Do you guys want to see some more?
(Applause)
That's interesting,
but let's get it better.
I need one more volunteer.
What is your name, sir?
Miguel Goncalves: Miguel.
GG: Miguel, all right.
You're going to stand right here.
So when you're moving your arm like this,
your brain is sending a signal
down to your muscles right here.
I want you to move your arm as well.
So your brain is going to send
a signal down to your muscles.
And so it turns out that there is
a nerve that's right here
that runs up here that innervates
these three fingers,
and it's close enough to the skin
that we might be able
to stimulate that so that what we can do
is copy your brain signals
going out to your hand
and inject it into your hand,
so that your hand will move
when your brain tells your hand to move.
So in a sense, she will take away
your free will
and you will no longer have
any control over this hand.
You with me?
So I just need to hook you up.
(Laughter)
So I'm going to find your ulnar nerve,
which is probably right around here.
You don't know what you're signing up for
when you come up.
So now I'm going to move away
and we're going to plug it in
to our human-to-human interface over here.
Okay, so Sam, I want you
to squeeze your hand again.
Do it again. Perfect.
So now I'm going to hook you up
over here so that you get the --
It's going to feel
a little bit weird at first,
this is going to feel like a --
(Laughter)
You know, when you lose your free will,
and someone else becomes your agent,
it does feel a bit strange.
Now I want you to relax your hand.
Sam, you're with me?
So you're going to squeeze.
I'm not going to turn it on yet,
so go ahead and give it a squeeze.
So now, are you ready, Miguel?
MG: Ready as I'll ever be.
GG: I've turned it on, so go ahead
and turn your hand.
Do you feel that a little bit?
MG: Nope.
GG: Okay, do it again?
MG: A little bit.
GG: A little bit? (Laughter)
So relax.
So hit it again.
(Laughter)
Oh, perfect, perfect.
So relax, do it again.
All right, so right now,
your brain is controlling your arm
and it's also controlling his arm,
so go ahead and just do it one more time.
All right, so it's perfect. (Laughter)
So now, what would happen
if I took over my control of your hand?
And so, just relax your hand.
What happens?
Ah, nothing.
Why not?
Because the brain has to do it.
So you do it again.
All right, that's perfect.
Thank you guys for being
such a good sport.
This is what's happening
all across the world --
electrophysiology!
We're going to bring on
the neuro-revolution.
Thank you.
(Applause)
I wrote a letter last week talking about the work of the foundation,
sharing some of the problems.
And Warren Buffet had recommended I do that --
being honest about what was going well, what wasn't,
and making it kind of an annual thing.
A goal I had there was to draw more people in to work on those problems,
because I think there are some very important problems
that don't get worked on naturally.
That is, the market does not drive the scientists,
the communicators, the thinkers, the governments
to do the right things.
And only by paying attention to these things
and having brilliant people who care and draw other people in
can we make as much progress as we need to.
So this morning I'm going to share two of these problems
and talk about where they stand.
But before I dive into those I want to admit that I am an optimist.
Any tough problem, I think it can be solved.
And part of the reason I feel that way is looking at the past.
Over the past century, average lifespan has more than doubled.
Another statistic, perhaps my favorite,
is to look at childhood deaths.
As recently as 1960, 110 million children were born,
and 20 million of those died before the age of five.
Five years ago, 135 million children were born -- so, more --
and less than 10 million of them died before the age of five.
So that's a factor of two reduction of the childhood death rate.
It's a phenomenal thing.
Each one of those lives matters a lot.
And the key reason we were able to it was not only rising incomes
but also a few key breakthroughs:
vaccines that were used more widely.
For example, measles was four million of the deaths
back as recently as 1990
and now is under 400,000.
So we really can make changes.
The next breakthrough is to cut that 10 million in half again.
And I think that's doable in well under 20 years.
Why? Well there's only a few diseases
that account for the vast majority of those deaths:
diarrhea, pneumonia and malaria.
So that brings us to the first problem that I'll raise this morning,
which is how do we stop a deadly disease that's spread by mosquitos?
Well, what's the history of this disease?
It's been a severe disease for thousands of years.
In fact, if we look at the genetic code,
it's the only disease we can see
that people who lived in Africa
actually evolved several things to avoid malarial deaths.
Deaths actually peaked at a bit over five million in the 1930s.
So it was absolutely gigantic.
And the disease was all over the world.
A terrible disease. It was in the United States. It was in Europe.
People didn't know what caused it until the early 1900s,
when a British military man figured out that it was mosquitos.
So it was everywhere.
And two tools helped bring the death rate down.
One was killing the mosquitos with DDT.
The other was treating the patients with quinine, or quinine derivatives.
And so that's why the death rate did come down.
Now, ironically, what happened was
it was eliminated from all the temperate zones,
which is where the rich countries are.
So we can see: 1900, it's everywhere.
1945, it's still most places.
1970, the U.S. and most of Europe have gotten rid of it.
1990, you've gotten most of the northern areas.
And more recently you can see it's just around the equator.
And so this leads to the paradox that
because the disease is only in the poorer countries,
it doesn't get much investment.
For example, there's more money put into baldness drugs
than are put into malaria.
Now, baldness, it's a terrible thing.
(Laughter)
And rich men are afflicted.
And so that's why that priority has been set.
But, malaria --
even the million deaths a year caused by malaria
greatly understate its impact.
Over 200 million people at any one time are suffering from it.
It means that you can't get the economies in these areas going
because it just holds things back so much.
Now, malaria is of course transmitted by mosquitos.
I brought some here, just so you could experience this.
We'll let those roam around the auditorium a little bit.
(Laughter)
There's no reason only poor people should have the experience.
(Laughter) (Applause)
Those mosquitos are not infected.
So we've come up with a few new things. We've got bed nets.
And bed nets are a great tool.
What it means is the mother and child stay under the bed net at night,
so the mosquitos that bite late at night can't get at them.
And when you use indoor spraying with DDT
and those nets
you can cut deaths by over 50 percent.
And that's happened now in a number of countries.
It's great to see.
But we have to be careful because malaria --
the parasite evolves and the mosquito evolves.
So every tool that we've ever had in the past has eventually become ineffective.
And so you end up with two choices.
If you go into a country with the right tools and the right way,
you do it vigorously,
you can actually get a local eradication.
And that's where we saw the malaria map shrinking.
Or, if you go in kind of half-heartedly,
for a period of time you'll reduce the disease burden,
but eventually those tools will become ineffective,
and the death rate will soar back up again.
And the world has gone through this where it paid attention and then didn't pay attention.
Now we're on the upswing.
Bed net funding is up.
There's new drug discovery going on.
Our foundation has backed a vaccine that's going into phase three trial
that starts in a couple months.
And that should save over two thirds of the lives if it's effective.
So we're going to have these new tools.
But that alone doesn't give us the road map.
Because the road map to get rid of this disease
involves many things.
It involves communicators to keep the funding high,
to keep the visibility high,
to tell the success stories.
It involves social scientists,
so we know how to get not just 70 percent of the people to use the bed nets,
but 90 percent.
We need mathematicians to come in and simulate this,
to do Monte Carlo things to understand how these tools combine and work together.
Of course we need drug companies to give us their expertise.
We need rich-world governments to be very generous in providing aid for these things.
And so as these elements come together,
I'm quite optimistic
that we will be able to eradicate malaria.
Now let me turn to a second question,
a fairly different question, but I'd say equally important.
And this is: How do you make a teacher great?
It seems like the kind of question that people would spend a lot of time on,
and we'd understand very well.
And the answer is, really, that we don't.
Let's start with why this is important.
Well, all of us here, I'll bet, had some great teachers.
We all had a wonderful education.
That's part of the reason we're here today,
part of the reason we're successful.
I can say that, even though I'm a college drop-out.
I had great teachers.
In fact, in the United States, the teaching system has worked fairly well.
There are fairly effective teachers in a narrow set of places.
So the top 20 percent of students have gotten a good education.
And those top 20 percent have been the best in the world,
if you measure them against the other top 20 percent.
And they've gone on to create the revolutions in software and biotechnology
and keep the U.S. at the forefront.
Now, the strength for those top 20 percent
is starting to fade on a relative basis,
but even more concerning is the education that the balance of people are getting.
Not only has that been weak. it's getting weaker.
And if you look at the economy, it really is only providing opportunities now
to people with a better education.
And we have to change this.
We have to change it so that people have equal opportunity.
We have to change it so that the country is strong
and stays at the forefront
of things that are driven by advanced education,
like science and mathematics.
When I first learned the statistics,
I was pretty stunned at how bad things are.
Over 30 percent of kids never finish high school.
And that had been covered up for a long time
because they always took the dropout rate as the number
who started in senior year and compared it to the number who finished senior year.
Because they weren't tracking where the kids were before that.
But most of the dropouts had taken place before that.
They had to raise the stated dropout rate
as soon as that tracking was done
to over 30 percent.
For minority kids, it's over 50 percent.
And even if you graduate from high school,
if you're low-income,
you have less than a 25 percent chance of ever completing a college degree.
If you're low-income in the United States,
you have a higher chance of going to jail
than you do of getting a four-year degree.
And that doesn't seem entirely fair.
So, how do you make education better?
Now, our foundation, for the last nine years, has invested in this.
There's many people working on it.
We've worked on small schools,
we've funded scholarships,
we've done things in libraries.
A lot of these things had a good effect.
But the more we looked at it, the more we realized that having great teachers
was the very key thing.
And we hooked up with some people studying
how much variation is there between teachers,
between, say, the top quartile -- the very best --
and the bottom quartile.
How much variation is there within a school or between schools?
And the answer is that these variations are absolutely unbelievable.
A top quartile teacher will increase the performance of their class --
based on test scores --
by over 10 percent in a single year.
What does that mean?
That means that if the entire U.S., for two years,
had top quartile teachers,
the entire difference between us and Asia would go away.
Within four years we would be blowing everyone in the world away.
So, it's simple. All you need are those top quartile teachers.
And so you'd say, "Wow, we should reward those people.
We should retain those people.
We should find out what they're doing and transfer that skill to other people."
But I can tell you that absolutely is not happening today.
What are the characteristics of this top quartile?
What do they look like?
You might think these must be very senior teachers.
And the answer is no.
Once somebody has taught for three years
their teaching quality does not change thereafter.
The variation is very, very small.
You might think these are people with master's degrees.
They've gone back and they've gotten their Master's of Education.
This chart takes four different factors
and says how much do they explain teaching quality.
That bottom thing, which says there's no effect at all,
is a master's degree.
Now, the way the pay system works is there's two things that are rewarded.
One is seniority.
Because your pay goes up and you vest into your pension.
The second is giving extra money to people who get their master's degree.
But it in no way is associated with being a better teacher.
Teach for America: slight effect.
For math teachers majoring in math there's a measurable effect.
But, overwhelmingly, it's your past performance.
There are some people who are very good at this.
And we've done almost nothing
to study what that is
and to draw it in and to replicate it,
to raise the average capability --
or to encourage the people with it to stay in the system.
You might say, "Do the good teachers stay and the bad teacher's leave?"
The answer is, on average, the slightly better teachers leave the system.
And it's a system with very high turnover.
Now, there are a few places -- very few -- where great teachers are being made.
A good example of one is a set of charter schools called KIPP.
KIPP means Knowledge Is Power.
It's an unbelievable thing.
They have 66 schools -- mostly middle schools, some high schools --
and what goes on is great teaching.
They take the poorest kids,
and over 96 percent of their high school graduates go to four-year colleges.
And the whole spirit and attitude in those schools
is very different than in the normal public schools.
They're team teaching. They're constantly improving their teachers.
They're taking data, the test scores,
and saying to a teacher, "Hey, you caused this amount of increase."
They're deeply engaged in making teaching better.
When you actually go and sit in one of these classrooms,
at first it's very bizarre.
I sat down and I thought, "What is going on?"
The teacher was running around, and the energy level was high.
I thought, "I'm in the sports rally or something.
What's going on?"
And the teacher was constantly scanning to see which kids weren't paying attention,
which kids were bored,
and calling kids rapidly, putting things up on the board.
It was a very dynamic environment,
because particularly in those middle school years -- fifth through eighth grade --
keeping people engaged and setting the tone
that everybody in the classroom needs to pay attention,
nobody gets to make fun of it or have the position of the kid who doesn't want to be there.
Everybody needs to be involved.
And so KIPP is doing it.
How does that compare to a normal school?
Well, in a normal school, teachers aren't told how good they are.
The data isn't gathered.
In the teacher's contract,
it will limit the number of times the principal can come into the classroom --
sometimes to once per year.
And they need advanced notice to do that.
So imagine running a factory where you've got these workers,
some of them just making crap
and the management is told, "Hey, you can only come down here once a year,
but you need to let us know, because we might actually fool you,
and try and do a good job in that one brief moment."
Even a teacher who wants to improve doesn't have the tools to do it.
They don't have the test scores,
and there's a whole thing of trying to block the data.
For example, New York passed a law
that said that the teacher improvement data could not be made available and used
in the tenure decision for the teachers.
And so that's sort of working in the opposite direction.
But I'm optimistic about this,
I think there are some clear things we can do.
First of all, there's a lot more testing going on,
and that's given us the picture of where we are.
And that allows us to understand who's doing it well,
and call them out, and find out what those techniques are.
Of course, digital video is cheap now.
Putting a few cameras in the classroom
and saying that things are being recorded on an ongoing basis
is very practical in all public schools.
And so every few weeks teachers could sit down
and say, "OK, here's a little clip of something I thought I did well.
Here's a little clip of something I think I did poorly.
Advise me -- when this kid acted up, how should I have dealt with that?"
And they could all sit and work together on those problems.
You can take the very best teachers and kind of annotate it,
have it so everyone sees who is the very best at teaching this stuff.
You can take those great courses and make them available
so that a kid could go out and watch the physics course, learn from that.
If you have a kid who's behind,
you would know you could assign them that video to watch and review the concept.
And in fact, these free courses could not only be available just on the Internet,
but you could make it so that DVDs were always available,
and so anybody who has access to a DVD player can have the very best teachers.
And so by thinking of this as a personnel system,
we can do it much better.
Now there's a book actually, about KIPP --
the place that this is going on --
that Jay Matthews, a news reporter, wrote -- called, "Work Hard, Be Nice."
And I thought it was so fantastic.
It gave you a sense of what a good teacher does.
I'm going to send everyone here a free copy of this book.
(Applause)
Now, we put a lot of money into education,
and I really think that education is the most important thing to get right
for the country to have as strong a future as it should have.
In fact we have in the stimulus bill -- it's interesting --
the House version actually had money in it for these data systems,
and it was taken out in the Senate
because there are people who are threatened by these things.
But I -- I'm optimistic.
I think people are beginning to recognize how important this is,
and it really can make a difference for millions of lives, if we get it right.
I only had time to frame those two problems.
There's a lot more problems like that --
AIDS, pneumonia -- I can just see you're getting excited,
just at the very name of these things.
And the skill sets required to tackle these things are very broad.
You know, the system doesn't naturally make it happen.
Governments don't naturally pick these things in the right way.
The private sector doesn't naturally put its resources into these things.
So it's going to take brilliant people like you
to study these things, get other people involved --
and you're helping to come up with solutions.
And with that, I think there's some great things that will come out of it.
Thank you.
(Applause)
The decorative use of wire in southern Africa
dates back hundreds of years.
But modernization actually brought communication
and a whole new material, in the form of telephone wire.
Rural to urban migration meant that newfound industrial materials
started to replace hard-to-come-by natural grasses.
So, here you can see the change
from use -- starting to use contemporary materials.
These pieces date back from the '40s to the late '50s.
In the '90s, my interest and passion for transitional art forms
led me to a new form,
which came from a squatter camp outside Durban.
And I got the opportunity to start working with this community
at that point, and started developing, really,
and mentoring them in terms of scale, in terms of the design.
And the project soon grew from five to 50 weavers in about a year.
Soon we had outgrown the scrap yards, what they could provide,
so we coerced a wire manufacturer to help us,
and not only to supply the materials on bobbins,
but to produce to our color specifications.
At the same time, I was thinking, well,
there's lots of possibility here to produce contemporary products,
away from the ethnic, a little bit more contemporary.
So I developed a whole range around -- mass-produced range --
that obviously fitted into a much higher-end decor market
that could be exported and also service our local market.
We started experimenting, as you can see, in terms of shapes,
forms. The scale became very important,
and it's become our pet project. It's successful,
it's been running for 12 years. And we supply the Conran shops,
and Donna Karan, and so it's kind of great.
This is our group, our main group of weavers.
They come on a weekly basis to Durban.
They all have bank accounts.
They've all moved back to the rural area where they came from.
It's a weekly turnaround of production.
This is the community that I originally showed you the slide of.
And that's also modernized today,
and it's supporting work for 300 weavers.
And the rest says it all.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
This story starts with these two --
my kids.
We were hiking in the Oakland woods
when my daughter noticed
a plastic tub of cat litter in a creek.
She looked at me and said,
"Daddy?
That doesn't go there."
When she said that,
it reminded me of summer camp.
On the morning of visiting day,
right before they'd let our anxious
parents come barreling through the gates,
our camp director would say,
"Quick! Everyone pick up
five pieces of litter."
You get a couple hundred kids
each picking up five pieces,
and pretty soon, you've got
a much cleaner camp.
So I thought,
why not apply that crowdsourced
cleanup model to the entire planet?
And that was the inspiration
for Litterati.
The vision is to create
a litter-free world.
Let me show you how it started.
I took a picture of a cigarette
using Instagram.
Then I took another photo ...
and another photo ...
and another photo.
And I noticed two things:
one, litter became artistic
and approachable;
and two,
at the end of a few days,
I had 50 photos on my phone
and I had picked up each piece,
and I realized that I was keeping a record
of the positive impact
I was having on the planet.
That's 50 less things that you might see,
or you might step on,
or some bird might eat.
So I started telling people
what I was doing,
and they started participating.
One day,
this photo showed up from China.
And that's when I realized
that Litterati was more
than just pretty pictures;
we were becoming a community
that was collecting data.
Each photo tells a story.
It tells us who picked up what,
a geotag tells us where
and a time stamp tells us when.
So I built a Google map,
and started plotting the points
where pieces were being picked up.
And through that process,
the community grew
and the data grew.
My two kids go to school
right in that bullseye.
Litter:
it's blending into
the background of our lives.
But what if we brought it
to the forefront?
What if we understood exactly
what was on our streets,
our sidewalks
and our school yards?
How might we use that data
to make a difference?
Well, let me show you.
The first is with cities.
San Francisco wanted to understand
what percentage of litter was cigarettes.
Why?
To create a tax.
So they put a couple of people
in the streets
with pencils and clipboards,
who walked around collecting information
which led to a 20-cent tax
on all cigarette sales.
And then they got sued
by big tobacco,
who claimed that collecting information
with pencils and clipboards
is neither precise nor provable.
The city called me and asked
if our technology could help.
I'm not sure they realized
that our technology
was my Instagram account --
(Laughter)
But I said, "Yes, we can."
(Laughter)
"And we can tell you
if that's a Parliament or a Pall Mall.
Plus, every photograph
is geotagged and time-stamped,
providing you with proof."
Four days and 5,000 pieces later,
our data was used in court
to not only defend but double the tax,
generating an annual recurring revenue
of four million dollars
for San Francisco to clean itself up.
Now, during that process
I learned two things:
one, Instagram is not the right tool --
(Laughter)
so we built an app.
And two, if you think about it,
every city in the world
has a unique litter fingerprint,
and that fingerprint provides
both the source of the problem
and the path to the solution.
If you could generate a revenue stream
just by understanding
the percentage of cigarettes,
well, what about coffee cups
or soda cans
or plastic bottles?
If you could fingerprint San Francisco,
well, how about Oakland
or Amsterdam
or somewhere much closer to home?
And what about brands?
How might they use this data
to align their environmental
and economic interests?
There's a block in downtown Oakland
that's covered in blight.
The Litterati community got together
and picked up 1,500 pieces.
And here's what we learned:
most of that litter came
from a very well-known taco brand.
Most of that brand's litter
were their own hot sauce packets,
and most of those hot sauce packets
hadn't even been opened.
The problem and the path
to the solution --
well, maybe that brand only
gives out hot sauce upon request
or installs bulk dispensers
or comes up with more
sustainable packaging.
How does a brand take
an environmental hazard,
turn it into an economic engine
and become an industry hero?
If you really want to create change,
there's no better place to start
than with our kids.
A group of fifth graders picked up
1,247 pieces of litter
just on their school yard.
And they learned that the most
common type of litter
were the plastic straw wrappers
from their own cafeteria.
So these kids went
to their principal and asked,
"Why are we still buying straws?"
And they stopped.
And they learned that individually
they could each make a difference,
but together they created an impact.
It doesn't matter
if you're a student or a scientist,
whether you live in Honolulu or Hanoi,
this is a community for everyone.
It started because of two little kids
in the Northern California woods,
and today it's spread across the world.
And you know how we're getting there?
One piece at a time.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Hi, my name is Frank,
and I collect secrets.
It all started with a crazy idea
in November of 2004.
I printed up 3,000 self-addressed postcards,
just like this.
They were blank on one side,
and on the other side
I listed some simple instructions.
I asked people to anonymously share an artful secret
they'd never told anyone before.
And I handed out these postcards randomly
on the streets of Washington, D.C.,
not knowing what to expect.
But soon the idea began spreading virally.
People began to buy their own postcards
and make their own postcards.
I started receiving secrets in my home mailbox,
not just with postmarks from Washington, D.C.,
but from Texas, California,
Vancouver, New Zealand, Iraq.
Soon my crazy idea didn't seem so crazy.
PostSecret.com
is the most visited advertisement-free blog in the world.
And this is my postcard collection today.
You can see my wife
struggling to stack a brick of postcards
on a pyramid of over a half-million secrets.
What I'd like to do now
is share with you a very special handful of secrets
from that collection,
starting with this one.
"I found these stamps as a child,
and I have been waiting all my life
to have someone to send them to.
I never did have someone."
Secrets can take many forms.
They can be shocking
or silly or soulful.
They can connect us to our deepest humanity
or with people we'll never meet.
(Laughter)
Maybe one of you sent this one in.
I don't know.
This one does a great job of demonstrating
the creativity that people have
when they make and mail me a postcard.
This one obviously was made out of half a Starbucks cup
with a stamp and my home address written on the other side.
"Dear Birthmother, I have great parents.
I've found love. I'm happy."
Secrets can remind us of the countless human dramas,
of frailty and heroism,
playing out silently
in the lives of people all around us
even now.
"Everyone who knew me before 9/11
believes I'm dead."
"I used to work with a bunch of uptight religious people,
so sometimes I didn't wear panties,
and just had a big smile and chuckled to myself."
(Laughter)
This next one takes a little explanation before I share it with you.
I love to speak on college campuses
and share secrets and the stories with students.
And sometimes afterwards I'll stick around
and sign books and take photos with students.
And this next postcard was made
out of one of those photos.
And I should also mention that, just like today,
at that PostSecret event,
I was using a wireless microphone.
"Your mic wasn't off during sound check.
We all heard you pee."
(Laughter)
This was really embarrassing when it happened,
until I realized it could have been worse.
Right. You know what I'm saying.
(Laughter)
"Inside this envelope
is the ripped up remains
of a suicide note I didn't use.
I feel like the happiest person on Earth (now.)"
"One of these men is the father of my son.
He pays me a lot to keep it a secret."
(Laughter)
"That Saturday when you wondered where I was,
well, I was getting your ring.
It's in my pocket right now."
I had this postcard posted on the PostSecret blog
two years ago on Valentine's Day.
It was the very bottom, the last secret in the long column.
And it hadn't been up for more than a couple hours
before I received this exuberant email
from the guy who mailed me this postcard.
And he said, "Frank, I've got to share with you
this story that just played out in my life."
He said, "My knees are still shaking."
He said, "For three years, my girlfriend and I,
we've made it this Sunday morning ritual
to visit the PostSecret blog together
and read the secrets out loud.
I read some to her, she reads some to me."
He says, "It's really brought us closer together
through the years.
And so when I discovered
that you had posted
my surprise proposal to my girlfriend at the very bottom,
I was beside myself.
And I tried to act calm, not to give anything away.
And just like every Sunday,
we started reading the secrets out loud to each other."
He said, "But this time it seemed like it was taking her forever
to get through each one."
But she finally did.
She got to that bottom secret, his proposal to her.
And he said, "She read it once and then she read it again."
And she turned to him and said,
"Is that our cat?"
(Laughter)
And when she saw him,
he was down on one knee, he had the ring out.
He popped the question, she said yes. It was a very happy ending.
So I emailed him back
and I said, "Please share with me an image, something,
that I can share with the whole PostSecret community
and let everyone know your fairy tale ending."
And he emailed me this picture.
(Laughter)
"I found your camera at Lollapalooza this summer.
I finally got the pictures developed
and I'd love to give them to you."
This picture never got returned back
to the people who lost it,
but this secret has impacted many lives,
starting with a student up in Canada
named Matty.
Matty was inspired by that secret
to start his own website,
a website called IFoundYourCamera.
Matty invites people
to mail him digital cameras that they've found,
memory sticks that have been lost
with orphan photos.
And Matty takes the pictures off these cameras
and posts them on his website every week.
And people come to visit
to see if they can identify a picture they've lost
or help somebody else get the photos back to them
that they might be desperately searching for.
This one's my favorite.
(Laughter)
Matty has found this ingenious way
to leverage the kindness of strangers.
And it might seem like a simple idea, and it is,
but the impact it can have on people's lives can be huge.
Matty shared with me
an emotional email he received
from the mother in that picture.
"That's me, my husband and son.
The other pictures are of my very ill grandmother.
Thank you for making your site.
These pictures mean more to me than you know.
My son's birth is on this camera.
He turns four tomorrow."
Every picture that you see there
and thousands of others
have been returned back to the person who lost it --
sometimes crossing oceans,
sometimes going through language barriers.
This is the last postcard I have to share with you today.
"When people I love
leave voicemails on my phone
I always save them in case they die tomorrow
and I have no other way
of hearing their voice ever again."
When I posted this secret,
dozens of people
sent voicemail messages from their phones,
sometimes ones they'd been keeping for years,
messages from family or friends
who had died.
They said that by preserving those voices
and sharing them,
it helped them keep the spirit of their loved ones alive.
One young girl
posted the last message
she ever heard from her grandmother.
Secrets can take many forms.
They can be shocking or silly
or soulful.
They can connect us with our deepest humanity
or with people we'll never meet again.
Voicemail recording: First saved voice message.
Grandma: ♫ It's somebody's birthday today ♫
♫ Somebody's birthday today ♫
♫ The candles are lighted ♫
♫ on somebody's cake ♫
♫ And we're all invited ♫
♫ for somebody's sake ♫
You're 21 years old today.
Have a real happy birthday, and I love you.
I'll say bye for now.
FW: Thank you.
(Applause)
Thank you.
(Applause)
June Cohen: Frank, that was beautiful,
so touching.
Have you ever sent yourself a postcard?
Have you ever sent in a secret to PostSecret?
FW: I have one of my own secrets in every book.
I think in some ways, the reason I started the project,
even though I didn't know it at the time,
was because I was struggling with my own secrets.
And it was through crowd-sourcing,
it was through the kindness that strangers were showing me,
that I could uncover
parts of my past that were haunting me.
JC: And has anyone ever discovered
which secret was yours in the book?
Has anyone in your life been able to tell?
FW: Sometimes I share that information, yeah.
(Laughter)
(Applause)
June 13, 2014
started as a routine Friday
in Redemption Hospital in Monrovia,
the capital of Liberia.
Redemption is the largest
free public health hospital in the city.
We are called upon to serve
hundreds of thousands of people.
In the best of times
it puts strain on our resources.
Monthly supplies run out within weeks,
and patients without beds
would be seated in chairs.
That summer, we had a nurse
who had been sick for a while.
Sick enough to be admitted
in our hospital.
But our treatment
didn't seem to be helping her;
her symptoms were getting worse:
diarrhea, severe abdominal pain,
fever and weakness.
On that particular Friday,
she developed severe respiratory distress,
and her eyes were menacingly red.
One of my fellow doctors,
a general surgeon,
became suspicious of her condition.
He said her symptoms
were suggestive of Ebola.
We kept a close watch on her,
we tried to help her.
We were treating her for malaria,
typhoid and gastroenteritis.
We didn't know it,
but by then it was too late.
The next morning I walked in
to check on my patient.
I could tell by the look in her eyes
that she was filled with fear.
I gave her reassurance,
but shortly after ...
she died of Ebola.
For me, her death was very personal.
But this was just the beginning.
A virtual biological bomb had exploded.
But the word spread faster than the virus,
and panic spread across the hospital.
All the patients ran away.
Then, all the nurses and doctors ran away.
This was the beginning
of our medical tsunami --
the devastating Ebola virus
that left an indelible scar
in our country's history.
I was not trained for this.
I had just graduated
from medical school two years before.
At this time,
my total knowledge about Ebola
came from a one-page article
I had read in medical school.
I perceived the disease as so dangerous,
this one page in essence had convinced me
to run out of the hospital, too,
the moment I heard of a case of Ebola.
But when it finally happened,
I stayed on and decided to help.
And so did several other
brave health care professionals.
But we would pay a heavy price.
Many persons and health professionals
had become high-risk contacts.
This actually meant 21 days counting
to potentially disease or death.
Our health systems were fragile,
our health workers
lacked skills and training.
So in the weeks and months that followed,
health workers were disproportionately
affected by the Ebola virus disease.
More than 400 nurses, doctors and other
health professionals became infected.
Unfortunately, my friend,
the general surgeon
who correctly identified
the symptoms in that first case
became one of the casualties.
On July 27, the president of Liberia
imposed quarantine
on the worst-affected areas.
She closed all the schools
and universities
and shut down many public events.
Four days later,
the United States Peace Corps
pulled out of Liberia,
out of Sierra Leone and Guinea
due to Ebola.
In August, six weeks after the nurse died,
hundreds of people were dying
of the disease each week.
People were dying in the streets.
Over the months that followed,
West Africa would lose thousands of people
to Ebola virus disease.
In August, I joined a team
to set up the Ebola treatment unit
at JFK hospital in Monrovia.
I was charged with running the second
Ebola treatment unit in the city.
Our unit provided hope for thousands
of patients, families and communities.
I not only provided care,
I came face to face with Ebola.
Living every day as a high-risk
Ebola virus disease contact
during the worst of the outbreak
was one of my worst experiences.
I started counting 21 days every day.
I lived every moment anticipating
the onset of symptoms of the disease.
I measured my body
temperature several times.
I showered with chlorinated water,
more concentrated
than actually recommended.
I chlorinated my phones,
my pants, my hands, my car.
My clothes became bleached.
Those days you were alone,
people were so afraid of touching anybody.
Everyone was counted
as a potential contact.
Touching would make them sick.
I was stigmatized.
But if that was what it was for me,
who was symptom-free,
imagine what it was for someone
who actually had symptoms,
someone who had Ebola.
We learned that to treat
Ebola successfully,
we had to suspend
some of the normal rules of society.
Our president declared
a state of emergency in August
and suspended certain rights.
And the national police even supported
our work during the Ebola response.
In February 2015,
gang members came in for isolation
in our Ebola isolation unit.
They were also know
as the VIP Boys of Monrovia,
terrifying small-time drug addicts
whose presence could instill
a tremendous amount of fear,
although they could not
legally carry guns.
They underwent quarantine for 21 days
in our unit and were not arrested.
We told the police,
"If you arrest them here,
they will stop coming,
they won't get treated.
And the Ebola virus
will continue to spread."
The police agreed, and we were able
to treat the VIP Boys,
and they did not have to worry
about being arrested while in the unit.
Over the course of the outbreak,
West Africa had almost 29,000 cases.
More than 11,000 people died.
And that included 12 of my fine colleagues
at John F. Kennedy hospital in Monrovia.
In June 2016, exactly 23 months
after my first Ebola patient died,
Liberia declared its Ebola outbreak ended.
We thought that once the outbreak ended,
so did the problems.
We hoped that life
would go back to normal.
Today, there are more
than 17,000 survivors in West Africa.
People who actually had
Ebola virus disease,
lived through it and survived.
We counted survival rate as a success:
the end of suffering for the patient
and fulfilling joy for families.
Every discharge from the unit
was a moment of jubilation.
At least so we thought.
The best description
of the moment of discharge
and a rare glimpse into the moment
that defines our life post-Ebola
was vividly expressed
in the words of my best friend
and fellow doctor, Philip Ireland,
in an interview with "The Times."
He said at the time of his release,
"There were a lot of people there
from JFK hospital:
my family, my elder brother,
my wife was there.
A lot of other doctors were there, too,
and members of the media were there.
And I felt like Nelson Mandela,
it felt like the 'Long Walk to Freedom,'
and I walked and raised
my hands to the heaven,
thanking God for saving my life."
And Philip said,
"Then I saw something else.
There were a lot of crying people,
people happy to see me.
But when I got close to anybody,
they backed away."
For many Ebola survivors,
society still seems to be backing away,
even as they struggle
to lead a normal life.
For these survivors, life can be compared
to another health emergency.
They may suffer debilitating
joint and body pain.
The suffering gradually decays
over time for most.
However, many continue
to bear intermittent pain.
Some survivors are blind,
others have neurological disabilities.
Some survivors experience stigmatization
every day, in many ways.
A lot of children are orphans.
Some survivors experience
post-traumatic stress disorder.
And some survivors
lack opportunity for education.
Even families can be split apart
by fear of Ebola, too.
There's no definitive cure
for transmitting Ebola virus through sex.
However, there are successful
interventions for prevention.
We have worked hard on semen testing,
behavioral counseling,
safe sex promotion and research.
For the past year, there have been
no cases of sexual transmission.
But some male survivors
have lost their spouses
out of fear they will be
infected with Ebola.
That's how families are torn apart.
Another tremendous challenge
for Ebola survivors
is obtaining adequate health care.
In theory, Liberia's public
health services are free of charge.
In practice, our health system
lacks the funding and capacity
to expand care
to all at the point of need.
Many survivors have waited
many months to undergo surgery
to heal their blinding cataracts.
Few had to relive
the traumatic experience,
when their blood was retested for Ebola
at the point of admission.
Some survivors experienced
delayed or deferred admission
due to limited bed capacity.
No bed available for one more patient.
This is neither national policy
nor officially condoned,
but many people are still afraid
of the sporadic resurgence of Ebola virus.
The results can be tragic.
I have seen Beatrice, an Ebola
survivor, several times now.
She's 26 years old.
Many of her family members
became infected, she luckily survived.
But since that day in 2014
she was discharged
to cheering health workers,
her life has never been the same.
She became blind as the result of Ebola.
In 2014, the baby of a dear friend of mine
was only two months old,
when both parents and child were admitted
in an Ebola treatment unit in Monrovia.
Luckily, they survived.
My friend's baby
is almost three years old now,
but cannot stand,
cannot walk, cannot speak.
He has failure to thrive.
There are many more hidden experiences
and many stories are yet untold.
The survivors of Ebola
deserve our attention and support.
The only way we can defeat this pandemic
is when we ensure
that we win this final battle.
Our best opportunity is to ensure
that every survivor receives
adequate care at the point of need
without any form of stigma
and at no cost to them personally.
How can a society consider itself healed
when a person's entire identity
is defined by the fact
that they recovered from Ebola?
Should a previous disease
that a person no longer has
become the sum total of their identity,
the identifier in their passport
that deters you from traveling
to seek medical care abroad?
Simply the ID that denies you health care.
Or prevents you from having
a relationship with your spouse.
Or denies you of family,
of friend or home.
Or prevents you from
carrying on your normal job,
so you can put food on the table
or have a roof over your family's head.
What is the meaning of the right to life
when our life is clouded by stigma
and barriers that fuel that stigma?
Until we have much better answers
to those questions in West Africa,
our work is not over yet.
Liberians are a resilient people.
And we know how to rise to a challenge,
even a devastating one.
My best memories of the outbreak
center on those many people
who survived the disease,
but I cannot forget the hard-working
nurses, doctors, volunteers and staff
who risked their own safety
in service of humanity.
And some even losing
their lives in the process.
During the worst of the contagion,
one thing kept us making those perilous
daily journeys into the Ebola wards.
We had a passion to save lives.
Was I afraid during the Ebola outbreak?
Of course I was.
But for me, the opportunity
to protect our global health security
and keep communities safe at home
and abroad was an honor.
So as the dangers became greater,
our humanity became stronger.
We faced our fears.
The global health community
working together defeated Ebola,
and that ...
that is how I know
that we can defeat its aftermath
in our hearts, in our minds
and in our communities.
Thank you.
(Applause)
(Music)
(Applause)

(Applause)
Robbie Mizzone: Thank you.
Tommy Mizzone: Thank you very much.
We're so excited to be here.
It's such an honor.
Like he said, we're
three brothers from New Jersey --
you know, the bluegrass
capital of the world.
(Laughter)
We discovered bluegrass a few years ago,
and we fell in love with it.
We hope you guys will too.
This next song is an original
we wrote called "Time Lapse,"
and it will probably live up to its name.
(Tuning)
(Music)
(Music ends)
(Applause)
TM: Thank you very much.
RM: I'm just going to take
a second to introduce the band.
On guitar is my 15-year-old brother Tommy.
(Applause)
On banjo is 10-year-old Jonny.
(Applause)
He's also our brother.
And I'm Robbie, and I'm 14,
and I play the fiddle.
(Applause)
As you can see, we decided
to make it hard on ourselves,
and we chose to play three songs
in three different keys.
(Tuning)
Yeah. I'm also going to explain,
a lot of people want to know
where we got the name
"Sleepy Man Banjo Boys" from.
So, it started when Jonny was little,
and he first started the banjo,
he would play on his back
with his eyes closed,
and we'd say it looked
like he was sleeping.
So you can probably piece
the rest together.
TM: We can't really figure out the reason.
It might have been
that it weighs about a million pounds.
(Music)
(Applause)
(Music)
(Music ends)
(Applause)
TM: Thank you very much.
(Cheering)
RM: Thank you.
(Applause)
Blah blah blah blah blah.
Blah blah blah blah,
blah blah, blah blah blah blah blah blah.
Blah blah blah, blah.
So what the hell was that?
Well, you don't know
because you couldn't understand it.
It wasn't clear.
But hopefully, it was said
with enough conviction
that it was at least
alluringly mysterious.
Clarity or mystery?
I'm balancing these two things
in my daily work as a graphic designer,
as well as my daily life as a New Yorker
every day,
and there are two elements
that absolutely fascinate me.
Here's an example.
Now, how many people know what this is?
Okay. Now how many people
know what this is?
Okay. Thanks to two more deft strokes
by the genius Charles M. Schulz,
we now have seven deft strokes
that in and of themselves
create an entire emotional life,
one that has enthralled
hundreds of millions of fans
for over 50 years.
This is actually a cover of a book
that I designed about the work
of Schulz and his art,
which will be coming out this fall,
and that is the entire cover.
There is no other typographic information
or visual information on the front,
and the name of the book
is "Only What's Necessary."
So this is sort of symbolic about
the decisions I have to make every day
about the design that I'm perceiving,
and the design I'm creating.
So clarity.
Clarity gets to the point.
It's blunt. It's honest. It's sincere.
We ask ourselves this.
["When should you be clear?"]
Now, something like this,
whether we can read it or not,
needs to be really, really clear.
Is it?
This is a rather recent example
of urban clarity that I just love,
mainly because I'm always late
and I am always in a hurry.
So when these meters started showing up
a couple of years ago on street corners,
I was thrilled, because now I finally knew
how many seconds I had
to get across the street
before I got run over by a car.
Six? I can do that. (Laughter)
So let's look at the yin
to the clarity yang,
and that is mystery.
Mystery is a lot more complicated
by its very definition.
Mystery demands to be decoded,
and when it's done right,
we really, really want to.
["When should you be mysterious?"]
In World War II, the Germans
really, really wanted to decode this,
and they couldn't.
Here's an example of a design
that I've done recently
for a novel by Haruki Murakami,
who I've done design work for
for over 20 years now,
and this is a novel about a young man
who has four dear friends
who all of a sudden,
after their freshman year of college,
completely cut him off
with no explanation,
and he is devastated.
And the friends' names each have
a connotation in Japanese to a color.
So there's Mr. Red, there's Mr. Blue,
there's Ms. White, and Ms. Black.
Tsukuru Tazaki, his name
does not correspond to a color,
so his nickname is Colorless, and
as he's looking back on their friendship,
he recalls that they were like
five fingers on a hand.
So I created this sort of abstract
representation of this,
but there's a lot more going on
underneath the surface of the story,
and there's more going on underneath
the surface of the jacket.
The four fingers are now four train lines
in the Tokyo subway system,
which has significance within the story.
And then you have
the colorless subway line
intersecting with each
of the other colors,
which basically he does
later on in the story.
He catches up with each of these people
to find out why they treated him
the way they did.
And so this is the three-dimensional
finished product
sitting on my desk in my office,
and what I was hoping for here
is that you'll simply be allured
by the mystery of what this looks like,
and will want to read it
to decode and find out and make more clear
why it looks the way it does.
["The Visual Vernacular."]
This is a way to use a more
familiar kind of mystery.
What does this mean?
This is what it means.
["Make it look like something else."]
The visual vernacular is the way
we are used to seeing a certain thing
applied to something else so that
we see it in a different way.
This is an approach I wanted to take
to a book of essays by David Sedaris
that had this title at the time.
["All the Beauty You Will Ever Need"]
Now, the challenge here was that
this title actually means nothing.
It's not connected to any
of the essays in the book.
It came to the author's boyfriend
in a dream.
Thank you very much, so -- (Laughter) --
so usually, I am creating a design
that is in some way based on the text,
but this is all the text there is.
So you've got this mysterious title
that really doesn't mean anything,
so I was trying to think:
Where might I see a bit of mysterious text
that seems to mean something but doesn't?
And sure enough, not long after,
one evening after a Chinese meal,
this arrived, and I thought,
"Ah, bing, ideagasm!" (Laughter)
I've always loved the hilariously
mysterious tropes of fortune cookies
that seem to mean something extremely deep
but when you think about them -- if you
think about them -- they really don't.
This says, "Hardly anyone knows how much
is gained by ignoring the future."
Thank you. (Laughter)
But we can take this visual vernacular
and apply it to Mr. Sedaris,
and we are so familiar
with how fortune cookie fortunes look
that we don't even need
the bits of the cookie anymore.
We're just seeing this strange thing
and we know we love David Sedaris,
and so we're hoping that
we're in for a good time.
["'Fraud' Essays by David Rakoff"]
David Rakoff was a wonderful writer
and he called his first book "Fraud"
because he was getting sent
on assignments by magazines
to do things that he
was not equipped to do.
So he was this skinny little urban guy
and GQ magazine would send him
down the Colorado River
whitewater rafting to see
if he would survive.
And then he would write about it,
and he felt that he was a fraud
and that he was misrepresenting himself.
And so I wanted the cover of this book
to also misrepresent itself
and then somehow show
a reader reacting to it.
This led me to graffiti.
I'm fascinated by graffiti.
I think anybody who lives
in an urban environment
encounters graffiti all the time,
and there's all different sorts of it.
This is a picture I took
on the Lower East Side
of just a transformer box on the sidewalk
and it's been tagged like crazy.
Now whether you look at this and think,
"Oh, that's a charming urban affectation,"
or you look at it and say,
"That's illegal abuse of property,"
the one thing I think we can all agree on
is that you cannot read it.
Right? There is no clear message here.
There is another kind of graffiti
that I find far more interesting,
which I call editorial graffiti.
This is a picture I took recently
in the subway,
and sometimes you see
lots of prurient, stupid stuff,
but I thought this was interesting,
and this is a poster that is saying
rah-rah Airbnb,
and someone has taken a Magic Marker
and has editorialized about
what they think about it.
And it got my attention.
So I was thinking, how do we
apply this to this book?
So I get the book by this person,
and I start reading it, and I'm thinking,
this guy is not who he says 
he is; he's a fraud.
And I get out a red Magic Marker,
and out of frustration just
scribble this across the front.
Design done. (Laughter)
And they went for it! (Laughter)
Author liked it, publisher liked it,
and that is how the book
went out into the world,
and it was really fun to see
people reading this on the subway
and walking around with it
and what have you,
and they all sort of looked
like they were crazy.
(Laughter)
["'Perfidia' a novel by James Ellroy"]
Okay, James Ellroy, amazing crime writer,
a good friend, I've worked
with him for many years.
He is probably best known as the author
of "The Black Dahlia"
and "L.A. Confidential."
His most recent novel was called this,
which is a very mysterious name
that I'm sure a lot of people know
what it means, but a lot of people don't.
And it's a story about a Japanese-American
detective in Los Angeles in 1941
investigating a murder.
And then Pearl Harbor happens,
and as if his life
wasn't difficult enough,
now the race relations
have really ratcheted up,
and then the Japanese-American
internment camps are quickly created,
and there's lots of tension
and horrible stuff as he's still
trying to solve this murder.
And so I did at first think
very literally about this in terms of
all right, we'll take Pearl Harbor
and we'll add it to Los Angeles
and we'll make this apocalyptic dawn
on the horizon of the city.
And so that's a picture from Pearl Harbor
just grafted onto Los Angeles.
My editor in chief said,
"You know, it's interesting
but I think you can do better
and I think you can make it simpler."
And so I went back
to the drawing board, as I often do.
But also, being alive to my surroundings,
I work in a high-rise in Midtown,
and every night,
before I leave the office,
I have to push this button to get out,
and the big heavy glass doors open
and I can get onto the elevator.
And one night, all of a sudden,
I looked at this and I saw it in a way
that I hadn't really noticed it before.
Big red circle, danger.
And I thought this was so obvious
that it had to have been
done a zillion times,
and so I did a Google image search,
and I couldn't find another book cover
that looked quite like this,
and so this is really
what solved the problem,
and graphically it's more interesting
and creates a bigger tension
between the idea
of a certain kind of sunrise
coming up over L.A. and America.
["'Gulp' A tour of the human
digestive system by Mary Roach."]
Mary Roach is an amazing writer
who takes potentially mundane
scientific subjects
and makes them not mundane at all;
she makes them really fun.
So in this particular case,
it's about the human digestive system.
So I'm trying to figure out what
is the cover of this book going to be.
This is a self-portrait. (Laughter)
Every morning I look at myself
in the medicine cabinet mirror
to see if my tongue is black.
And if it's not, I'm good to go.
(Laughter)
I recommend you all do this.
But I also started thinking,
here's our introduction.
Right? Into the human digestive system.
But I think what we can all agree on
is that actual photographs
of human mouths, at least based on this,
are off-putting. (Laughter)
So for the cover, then,
I had this illustration done
which is literally more palatable
and reminds us that it's best
to approach the digestive system
from this end.
(Laughter)
I don't even have to complete
the sentence. All right.
["Unuseful mystery"]
What happens when clarity
and mystery get mixed up?
And we see this all the time.
This is what I call unuseful mystery.
I go down into the subway --
I take the subway a lot --
and this piece of paper
is taped to a girder.
Right? And now I'm thinking, uh-oh,
and the train's about to come and I'm
trying to figure out what this means,
and thanks a lot.
Part of the problem here is that
they've compartmentalized the information
in a way they think is helpful,
and frankly, I don't think it is at all.
So this is mystery we do not need.
What we need is useful clarity,
so just for fun, I redesigned this.
This is using all the same elements.
(Applause)
Thank you. I am still waiting
for a call from the MTA. (Laughter)
You know, I'm actually not even
using more colors than they use.
They just didn't even bother
to make the 4 and the 5 green,
those idiots. (Laughter)
So the first thing we see
is that there is a service change,
and then, in two complete sentences
with a beginning, a middle and an end,
it tells us what the change is
and what's going to be happening.
Call me crazy! (Laughter)
["Useful mystery"]
All right.
Now, here is a piece
of mystery that I love:
packaging.
This redesign of the Diet Coke can
by Turner Duckworth
is to me truly a piece of art.
It's a work of art. It's beautiful.
But part of what makes it
so heartening to me as a designer
is that he's taken the visual
vernacular of Diet Coke --
the typefaces, the colors,
the silver background --
and he's reduced them
to their most essential parts,
so it's like going back
to the Charlie Brown face.
It's like, how can you give them just
enough information so they know what it is
but giving them the credit
for the knowledge that they already have
about this thing?
It looks great, and you would go
into a delicatessen
and all of a sudden see that on the shelf,
and it's wonderful.
Which makes the next thing --
["Unuseful clarity"] --
all the more disheartening,
at least to me.
So okay, again, going back
down into the subway,
after this came out,
these are pictures that I took.
Times Square subway station:
Coca-Cola has bought out
the entire thing for advertising. Okay?
And maybe some of you
know where this is going.
Ahem.
"You moved to New York
with the clothes on your back,
the cash in your pocket,
and your eyes on the prize.
You're on Coke." (Laughter)
"You moved to New York
with an MBA, one clean suit,
and an extremely firm handshake.
You're on Coke." (Laughter)
These are real! (Laughter)
Not even the support beams were spared,
except they switched into Yoda mode.
(Laughter)
"Coke you're on." (Laughter)
["Excuse me, I'm on WHAT??"]
This campaign was a huge misstep.
It was pulled almost instantly
due to consumer backlash
and all sorts of unflattering
parodies on the web --
(Laughter) --
and also that dot next to "You're on,"
that's not a period, that's a trademark.
So thanks a lot.
So to me, this was just so bizarre
about how they could get the packaging
so mysteriously beautiful and perfect
and the message so unbearably,
clearly wrong.
It was just incredible to me.
So I just hope that I've been able
to share with you some of my insights
on the uses of clarity
and mystery in my work,
and maybe how you might decide
to be more clear in your life,
or maybe to be a bit more mysterious
and not so over-sharing.
(Laughter)
And if there's just one thing
that I leave you with from this talk,
I hope it's this:
Blih blih blih blah. Blah blah blih blih.
["'Judge This,' Chip Kidd"]
Blih blih blah blah blah.
Blah blah blah.
Blah blah.
(Applause)
I am very, very happy to be amidst some of the most --
the lights are really disturbing my eyes
and they're reflecting on my glasses.
I am very happy and honored to be amidst
very, very innovative and intelligent people.
I have listened to the three previous speakers,
and guess what happened?
Every single thing I planned to say, they have said it here,
and it looks and sounds like I have nothing else to say.
(Laughter)
But there is a saying in my culture
that if a bud leaves a tree without saying something,
that bud is a young one.
So, I will -- since I am not young and am very old,
I still will say something.
We are hosting this conference at a very opportune moment,
because another conference is taking place in Berlin.
It is the G8 Summit.
The G8 Summit proposes that the solution to Africa's problems
should be a massive increase in aid,
something akin to the Marshall Plan.
Unfortunately, I personally do not believe in the Marshall Plan.
One, because the benefits of the Marshall Plan have been overstated.
Its largest recipients were Germany and France,
and it was only 2.5 percent of their GDP.
An average African country receives foreign aid
to the tune of 13, 15 percent of its GDP,
and that is an unprecedented transfer of financial resources
from rich countries to poor countries.
But I want to say that there are two things we need to connect.
How the media covers Africa in the West, and the consequences of that.
By displaying despair, helplessness and hopelessness,
the media is telling the truth about Africa, and nothing but the truth.
However, the media is not telling us the whole truth.
Because despair, civil war, hunger and famine,
although they're part and parcel of our African reality,
they are not the only reality.
And secondly, they are the smallest reality.
Africa has 53 nations.
We have civil wars only in six countries,
which means that the media are covering only six countries.
Africa has immense opportunities that never navigate
through the web of despair and helplessness
that the Western media largely presents to its audience.
But the effect of that presentation is, it appeals to sympathy.
It appeals to pity. It appeals to something called charity.
And, as a consequence, the Western view
of Africa's economic dilemma is framed wrongly.
The wrong framing is a product of thinking
that Africa is a place of despair.
What should we do with it? We should give food to the hungry.
We should deliver medicines to those who are ill.
We should send peacekeeping troops
to serve those who are facing a civil war.
And in the process, Africa has been stripped of self-initiative.
I want to say that it is important to recognize
that Africa has fundamental weaknesses.
But equally, it has opportunities and a lot of potential.
We need to reframe the challenge that is facing Africa,
from a challenge of despair,
which is called poverty reduction,
to a challenge of hope.
We frame it as a challenge of hope, and that is worth creation.
The challenge facing all those who are interested in Africa
is not the challenge of reducing poverty.
It should be a challenge of creating wealth.
Once we change those two things --
if you say the Africans are poor and they need poverty reduction,
you have the international cartel of good intentions
moving onto the continent, with what?
Medicines for the poor, food relief for those who are hungry,
and peacekeepers for those who are facing civil war.
And in the process, none of these things really are productive
because you are treating the symptoms, not the causes
of Africa's fundamental problems.
Sending somebody to school and giving them medicines,
ladies and gentlemen, does not create wealth for them.
Wealth is a function of income, and income comes from you finding
a profitable trading opportunity or a well-paying job.
Now, once we begin to talk about wealth creation in Africa,
our second challenge will be,
who are the wealth-creating agents in any society?
They are entrepreneurs. [Unclear] told us they are always
about four percent of the population, but 16 percent are imitators.
But they also succeed at the job of entrepreneurship.
So, where should we be putting the money?
We need to put money where it can productively grow.
Support private investment in Africa, both domestic and foreign.
Support research institutions,
because knowledge is an important part of wealth creation.
But what is the international aid community doing with Africa today?
They are throwing large sums of money for primary health,
for primary education, for food relief.
The entire continent has been turned into
a place of despair, in need of charity.
Ladies and gentlemen, can any one of you tell me
a neighbor, a friend, a relative that you know,
who became rich by receiving charity?
By holding the begging bowl and receiving alms?
Does any one of you in the audience have that person?
Does any one of you know a country that developed because of
the generosity and kindness of another?
Well, since I'm not seeing the hand,
it appears that what I'm stating is true.
(Bono: Yes!)
Andrew Mwenda: I can see Bono says he knows the country.
Which country is that?
(Bono: It's an Irish land.)
(Laughter)
(Bono: [unclear])
AM: Thank you very much. But let me tell you this.
External actors can only present to you an opportunity.
The ability to utilize that opportunity and turn it into an advantage
depends on your internal capacity.
Africa has received many opportunities.
Many of them we haven't benefited much.
Why? Because we lack the internal, institutional framework
and policy framework that can make it possible for us
to benefit from our external relations. I'll give you an example.
Under the Cotonou Agreement,
formerly known as the Lome Convention,
African countries have been given an opportunity by Europe
to export goods, duty-free, to the European Union market.
My own country, Uganda, has a quota to export 50,000 metric tons
of sugar to the European Union market.
We haven't exported one kilogram yet.
We import 50,000 metric tons of sugar from Brazil and Cuba.
Secondly, under the beef protocol of that agreement,
African countries that produce beef
have quotas to export beef duty-free to the European Union market.
None of those countries, including Africa's most successful nation, Botswana,
has ever met its quota.
So, I want to argue today that the fundamental source of Africa's
inability to engage the rest of the world
in a more productive relationship
is because it has a poor institutional and policy framework.
And all forms of intervention need support,
the evolution of the kinds of institutions that create wealth,
the kinds of institutions that increase productivity.
How do we begin to do that, and why is aid the bad instrument?
Aid is the bad instrument, and do you know why?
Because all governments across the world need money to survive.
Money is needed for a simple thing like keeping law and order.
You have to pay the army and the police to show law and order.
And because many of our governments are quite dictatorial,
they need really to have the army clobber the opposition.
The second thing you need to do is pay your political hangers-on.
Why should people support their government?
Well, because it gives them good, paying jobs,
or, in many African countries, unofficial opportunities
to profit from corruption.
The fact is no government in the world,
with the exception of a few, like that of Idi Amin,
can seek to depend entirely on force as an instrument of rule.
Many countries in the [unclear], they need legitimacy.
To get legitimacy, governments often need to deliver things like primary education,
primary health, roads, build hospitals and clinics.
If the government's fiscal survival
depends on it having to raise money from its own people,
such a government is driven by self-interest
to govern in a more enlightened fashion.
It will sit with those who create wealth.
Talk to them about the kind of policies and institutions
that are necessary for them to expand a scale and scope of business
so that it can collect more tax revenues from them.
The problem with the African continent
and the problem with the aid industry
is that it has distorted the structure of incentives
facing the governments in Africa.
The productive margin in our governments' search for revenue
does not lie in the domestic economy,
it lies with international donors.
Rather than sit with Ugandan --
(Applause) --
rather than sit with Ugandan entrepreneurs,
Ghanaian businessmen, South African enterprising leaders,
our governments find it more productive
to talk to the IMF and the World Bank.
I can tell you, even if you have ten Ph.Ds.,
you can never beat Bill Gates in understanding the computer industry.
Why? Because the knowledge that is required for you to understand
the incentives necessary to expand a business --
it requires that you listen to the people, the private sector actors in that industry.
Governments in Africa have therefore been given an opportunity,
by the international community, to avoid building
productive arrangements with your own citizens,
and therefore allowed to begin endless negotiations with the IMF
and the World Bank, and then it is the IMF and the World Bank
that tell them what its citizens need.
In the process, we, the African people, have been sidelined
from the policy-making, policy-orientation, and policy-
implementation process in our countries.
We have limited input, because he who pays the piper calls the tune.
The IMF, the World Bank, and the cartel of good intentions in the world
has taken over our rights as citizens,
and therefore what our governments are doing, because they depend on aid,
is to listen to international creditors rather than their own citizens.
But I want to put a caveat on my argument,
and that caveat is that it is not true that aid is always destructive.
Some aid may have built a hospital, fed a hungry village.
It may have built a road, and that road
may have served a very good role.
The mistake of the international aid industry
is to pick these isolated incidents of success,
generalize them, pour billions and trillions of dollars into them,
and then spread them across the whole world,
ignoring the specific and unique circumstances in a given village,
the skills, the practices, the norms and habits
that allowed that small aid project to succeed --
like in Sauri village, in Kenya, where Jeffrey Sachs is working --
and therefore generalize this experience
as the experience of everybody.
Aid increases the resources available to governments,
and that makes working in a government the most profitable thing
you can have, as a person in Africa seeking a career.
By increasing the political attractiveness of the state,
especially in our ethnically fragmented societies in Africa,
aid tends to accentuate ethnic tensions
as every single ethnic group now begins struggling to enter the state
in order to get access to the foreign aid pie.
Ladies and gentlemen, the most enterprising people in Africa
cannot find opportunities to trade and to work in the private sector
because the institutional and policy environment is hostile to business.
Governments are not changing it. Why?
Because they don't need to talk to their own citizens.
They talk to international donors.
So, the most enterprising Africans end up going to work for government,
and that has increased the political tensions in our countries
precisely because we depend on aid.
I also want to say that it is important for us to
note that, over the last 50 years, Africa has been receiving increasing aid
from the international community,
in the form of technical assistance, and financial aid,
and all other forms of aid.
Between 1960 and 2003, our continent received 600 billion dollars of aid,
and we are still told that there is a lot of poverty in Africa.
Where has all the aid gone?
I want to use the example of my own country, called Uganda,
and the kind of structure of incentives that aid has brought there.
In the 2006-2007 budget, expected revenue: 2.5 trillion shillings.
The expected foreign aid: 1.9 trillion.
Uganda's recurrent expenditure -- by recurrent what do I mean?
Hand-to-mouth is 2.6 trillion.
Why does the government of Uganda budget spend 110 percent
of its own revenue?
It's because there's somebody there called foreign aid, who contributes for it.
But this shows you that the government of Uganda
is not committed to spending its own revenue
to invest in productive investments,
but rather it devotes this revenue
to paying structure of public expenditure.
Public administration, which is largely patronage, takes 690 billion.
The military, 380 billion.
Agriculture, which employs 18 percent of our poverty-stricken citizens,
takes only 18 billion.
Trade and industry takes 43 billion.
And let me show you, what does public expenditure --
rather, public administration expenditure -- in Uganda constitute?
There you go. 70 cabinet ministers, 114 presidential advisers,
by the way, who never see the president, except on television.
(Laughter)
(Applause)
And when they see him physically, it is at public functions like this,
and even there, it is him who advises them.
(Laughter)
We have 81 units of local government.
Each local government is organized like the central government --
a bureaucracy, a cabinet, a parliament,
and so many jobs for the political hangers-on.
There were 56, and when our president wanted to
amend the constitution and remove term limits,
he had to create 25 new districts, and now there are 81.
Three hundred thirty-three members of parliament.
You need Wembley Stadium to host our parliament.
One hundred thirty-four commissions
and semi-autonomous government bodies,
all of which have directors and the cars. And the final thing,
this is addressed to Mr. Bono. In his work, he may help us on this.
A recent government of Uganda study found
that there are 3,000 four-wheel drive motor vehicles
at the Minister of Health headquarters.
Uganda has 961 sub-counties, each of them with a dispensary,
none of which has an ambulance.
So, the four-wheel drive vehicles at the headquarters
drive the ministers, the permanent secretaries, the bureaucrats
and the international aid bureaucrats who work in aid projects,
while the poor die without ambulances and medicine.
Finally, I want to say that before I came to speak here,
I was told that the principle of TEDGlobal
is that the good speech should be like a miniskirt.
It should be short enough to arouse interest,
but long enough to cover the subject.
I hope I have achieved that.
(Laughter)
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
How many of you are tired
of seeing celebrities adopting kids
from the African continent?
(Laughter)
Well, it's not all that bad.
I was adopted.
I grew up in rural Uganda,
lost both my parents
when I was very, very young.
And when my parents passed,
I experienced all the negative
effects of poverty,
from homelessness,
eating out of trash piles,
you name it.
But my life changed
when I got accepted into an orphanage.
Through one of those
sponsor-an-orphan programs,
I was sponsored and given an opportunity
to acquire an education.
I started off in Uganda.
I went through school, and the way
this particular program worked,
you finished high school
and after high school,
you go learn a trade --
to become a carpenter, a mechanic
or something along those lines.
My case was a little different.
The sponsor family that was sending
these 25 dollars a month
to this orphanage to sponsor me,
which -- I had never met them --
said, "Well ...
we would like to send you
to college instead."
Oh -- it gets better.
(Laughter)
And they said, "If you get the paperwork,
we'll send you to school
in America instead."
So with their help,
I went to the embassy
and applied for the visa.
I got the visa.
I remember this day like it was yesterday.
I walked out of the embassy
with this piece of paper in my hand,
a hop in my step,
smile on my face,
knowing that my life is about to change.
I went home that night,
and I slept with my passport,
because I was afraid
that someone might steal it.
(Laughter)
I couldn't fall asleep.
I kept feeling it.
I had a good idea for security.
I was like, "OK, I'm going
to put it in a plastic bag,
and take it outside and dig a hole,
and put it in there."
I did that, went back in the house.
I could not fall asleep. I was like,
"Maybe someone saw me."
I went back --
(Laughter)
I pulled it out, and I put it
with me the entire night --
all to say that it was
an anxiety-filled night.
(Laughter)
Going to the US was,
just like another speaker said,
was my first time to see a plane,
be on one, let alone sit on it
to fly to another country.
December 15, 2006.
7:08pm.
I sat in seat 7A.
Fly Emirates.
One of the most gorgeous,
beautiful women I've ever seen walked up,
red little hat with a white veil.
I'm looking terrified,
I have no idea what I'm doing.
She hands me this warm towel --
warm, steamy, snow white.
I'm looking at this warm towel;
I don't know what to do with my life,
let alone with this damn towel --
(Laughter)
(Applause)
I did one of the --
you know, anything anyone
could do in that situation:
look around, see what
everyone else is doing.
I did the same.
Mind you, I drove about seven hours
from my village to the airport that day.
So I grab this warm towel,
wipe my face just like
everyone else is doing,
I look at it --
damn.
(Laughter)
It was all dirt brown.
(Laughter)
I remember being so embarrassed
that when she came by to pick it up,
I didn't give mine.
(Laughter)
I still have it.
(Laughter)
(Applause)
Going to America opened doors for me
to live up to my full God-given potential.
I remember when I arrived,
the sponsor family embraced me,
and they literally had to teach me
everything from scratch:
this is a microwave,
that's a refrigerator --
things I'd never seen before.
And it was also the first time
I got immersed into a new
and different culture.
These strangers showed me
true love.
These strangers showed me that I mattered,
that my dreams mattered.
(Applause)
Thank you.
These individuals had two
of their own biological children.
And when I came in, I had needs.
They had to teach me English,
teach me literally everything,
which resulted in them spending
a lot of time with me.
And that created a little bit
of jealousy with their children.
So, if you're a parent in this room,
and you have those teenager children
who don't want anything to do
with your love and affection --
in fact, they find it repulsive --
I got a solution:
adopt a child.
(Laughter)
It will solve the problem.
(Applause)
I went on to acquire
two engineering degrees
from one of the best
institutions in the world.
I've got to tell you:
talent is universal,
but opportunities are not.
And I credit this
to the individuals
who embrace multiculturalism,
love, empathy
and compassion for others.
We live in a world filled with hate:
building walls,
Brexit,
xenophobia here on the African continent.
Multiculturalism can be an answer
to many of these worst human qualities.
Today, I challenge you
to help a young child
experience multiculturalism.
I guarantee you
that will enrich their life,
and in turn,
it will enrich yours.
And as a bonus,
one of them may even give a TED Talk.
(Laughter)
(Applause)
We may not be able to solve the bigotry
and the racism of this world today,
but certainly we can raise children
to create a positive,
inclusive, connected world
full of empathy,
love
and compassion.
Love wins.
Thank you.
(Applause)
If I asked you to picture the air,
what do you imagine?
Most people think about either empty space
or clear blue sky
or sometimes trees dancing in the wind.
And then I remember my high school
chemistry teacher with really long socks
at the blackboard,
drawing diagrams of bubbles
connected to other bubbles,
and describing how they vibrate
and collide in a kind of frantic soup.
But really, we tend not to think
about the air that much at all.
We notice it mostly
when there's some kind of unpleasant
sensory intrusion upon it,
like a terrible smell
or something visible like smoke or mist.
But it's always there.
It's touching all of us right now.
It's even inside us.
Our air is immediate, vital and intimate.
And yet, it's so easily forgotten.
So what is the air?
It's the combination of the invisible
gases that envelop the Earth,
attracted by the Earth's
gravitational pull.
And even though I'm a visual artist,
I'm interested in
the invisibility of the air.
I'm interested in how we imagine it,
how we experience it
and how we all have an innate
understanding of its materiality
through breathing.
All life on Earth changes the air
through gas exchange,
and we're all doing it right now.
Actually, why don't we all
right now together take
one big, collective, deep breath in.
Ready? In. (Inhales)
And out. (Exhales)
That air that you just exhaled,
you enriched a hundred times
in carbon dioxide.
So roughly five liters of air per breath,
17 breaths per minute
of the 525,600 minutes per year,
comes to approximately
45 million liters of air,
enriched 100 times in carbon dioxide,
just for you.
Now, that's equivalent to about 18
Olympic-sized swimming pools.
For me, air is plural.
It's simultaneously
as small as our breathing
and as big as the planet.
And it's kind of hard to picture.
Maybe it's impossible,
and maybe it doesn't matter.
Through my visual arts practice,
I try to make air, not so much picture it,
but to make it visceral
and tactile and haptic.
I try to expand this notion
of the aesthetic, how things look,
so that it can include things
like how it feels on your skin
and in your lungs,
and how your voice sounds
as it passes through it.
I explore the weight, density and smell,
but most importantly,
I think a lot about the stories we attach
to different kinds of air.
This is a work I made in 2014.
It's called "Different Kinds
of Air: A Plant's Diary,"
where I was recreating the air
from different eras in Earth's evolution,
and inviting the audience
to come in and breathe them with me.
And it's really surprising,
so drastically different.
Now, I'm not a scientist,
but atmospheric scientists
will look for traces
in the air chemistry in geology,
a bit like how rocks can oxidize,
and they'll extrapolate
that information and aggregate it,
such that they can
pretty much form a recipe
for the air at different times.
Then I come in as the artist
and take that recipe
and recreate it using the component gases.
I was particularly interested
in moments of time
that are examples
of life changing the air,
but also the air that can influence
how life will evolve,
like Carboniferous air.
It's from about 300 to 350
million years ago.
It's an era known
as the time of the giants.
So for the first time
in the history of life,
lignin evolves.
That's the hard stuff
that trees are made of.
So trees effectively invent
their own trunks at this time,
and they get really big,
bigger and bigger,
and pepper the Earth,
releasing oxygen, releasing
oxygen, releasing oxygen,
such that the oxygen levels
are about twice as high
as what they are today.
And this rich air supports
massive insects --
huge spiders and dragonflies
with a wingspan of about 65 centimeters.
To breathe, this air is really clean
and really fresh.
It doesn't so much have a flavor,
but it does give your body
a really subtle kind of boost of energy.
It's really good for hangovers.
(Laughter)
Or there's the air of the Great Dying --
that's about 252.5 million years ago,
just before the dinosaurs evolve.
It's a really short time period,
geologically speaking,
from about 20- to 200,000 years.
Really quick.
This is the greatest extinction event
in Earth's history,
even bigger than when
the dinosaurs died out.
Eighty-five to 95 percent of species
at this time die out,
and simultaneous to that is a huge,
dramatic spike in carbon dioxide,
that a lot of scientists agree
comes from a simultaneous
eruption of volcanoes
and a runaway greenhouse effect.
Oxygen levels at this time go
to below half of what they are today,
so about 10 percent.
So this air would definitely not
support human life,
but it's OK to just have a breath.
And to breathe, it's oddly comforting.
It's really calming, it's quite warm
and it has a flavor a little bit
like soda water.
It has that kind of spritz,
quite pleasant.
So with all this thinking
about air of the past,
it's quite natural to start thinking
about the air of the future.
And instead of being speculative with air
and just making up what I think
might be the future air,
I discovered this human-synthesized air.
That means that it doesn't occur
anywhere in nature,
but it's made by humans in a laboratory
for application in different
industrial settings.
Why is it future air?
Well, this air is a really stable molecule
that will literally be part of the air
once it's released,
for the next 300 to 400 years,
before it's broken down.
So that's about 12 to 16 generations.
And this future air has
some very sensual qualities.
It's very heavy.
It's about eight times heavier
than the air we're used to breathing.
It's so heavy, in fact,
that when you breathe it in,
whatever words you speak
are kind of literally heavy as well,
so they dribble down your chin
and drop to the floor
and soak into the cracks.
It's an air that operates
quite a lot like a liquid.
Now, this air comes
with an ethical dimension as well.
Humans made this air,
but it's also the most potent
greenhouse gas
that has ever been tested.
Its warming potential is 24,000 times
that of carbon dioxide,
and it has that longevity
of 12 to 16 generations.
So this ethical confrontation
is really central to my work.
(In a lowered voice) It has
another quite surprising quality.
It changes the sound of your voice
quite dramatically.
(Laughter)
So when we start to think -- ooh!
It's still there a bit.
(Laughter)
When we think about climate change,
we probably don't think about
giant insects and erupting volcanoes
or funny voices.
The images that more readily come to mind
are things like retreating glaciers
and polar bears adrift on icebergs.
We think about pie charts
and column graphs
and endless politicians
talking to scientists wearing cardigans.
But perhaps it's time we start
thinking about climate change
on the same visceral level
that we experience the air.
Like air, climate change is simultaneously
at the scale of the molecule,
the breath and the planet.
It's immediate, vital and intimate,
as well as being amorphous and cumbersome.
And yet, it's so easily forgotten.
Climate change is the collective
self-portrait of humanity.
It reflects our decisions as individuals,
as governments and as industries.
And if there's anything
I've learned from looking at air,
it's that even though
it's changing, it persists.
It may not support the kind of life
that we'd recognize,
but it will support something.
And if we humans are such a vital
part of that change,
I think it's important
that we can feel the discussion.
Because even though it's invisible,
humans are leaving
a very vibrant trace in the air.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Today I want to talk
about the meaning of words,
how we define them
and how they, almost as revenge,
define us.
The English language
is a magnificent sponge.
I love the English language.
I'm glad that I speak it.
But for all that, it has a lot of holes.
In Greek, there's a word, "lachesism"
which is the hunger for disaster.
You know, when you see
a thunderstorm on the horizon
and you just find yourself
rooting for the storm.
In Mandarin, they have a word "yù yī" --
I'm not pronouncing that correctly --
which means the longing
to feel intensely again
the way you did when you were a kid.
In Polish, they have a word "jouska"
which is the kind of
hypothetical conversation
that you compulsively
play out in your head.
And finally, in German,
of course in German,
they have a word called "zielschmerz"
which is the dread
of getting what you want.
(Laughter)
Finally fulfilling a lifelong dream.
I'm German myself,
so I know exactly what that feels like.
Now, I'm not sure
if I would use any of these words
as I go about my day,
but I'm really glad they exist.
But the only reason they exist
is because I made them up.
I am the author of "The Dictionary
of Obscure Sorrows,"
which I've been writing
for the last seven years.
And the whole mission of the project
is to find holes
in the language of emotion
and try to fill them
so that we have a way of talking
about all those human peccadilloes
and quirks of the human condition
that we all feel
but may not think to talk about
because we don't have the words to do it.
And about halfway through this project,
I defined "sonder,"
the idea that we all think of ourselves
as the main character
and everyone else is just extras.
But in reality,
we're all the main character,
and you yourself are an extra
in someone else's story.
And so as soon as I published that,
I got a lot of response from people
saying, "Thank you for giving voice
to something I had felt all my life
but there was no word for that."
So it made them feel less alone.
That's the power of words,
to make us feel less alone.
And it was not long after that
that I started to notice sonder
being used earnestly
in conversations online,
and not long after I actually noticed it,
I caught it next to me
in an actual conversation in person.
There is no stranger feeling
than making up a word
and then seeing it
take on a mind of its own.
I don't have a word
for that yet, but I will.
(Laughter)
I'm working on it.
I started to think
about what makes words real,
because a lot of people ask me,
the most common thing
I got from people is,
"Well, are these words made up?
I don't really understand."
And I didn't really know what to tell them
because once sonder started to take off,
who am I to say what words
are real and what aren't.
And so I sort of felt like Steve Jobs,
who described his epiphany
as when he realized that most of us,
as we go through the day,
we just try to avoid
bouncing against the walls too much
and just sort of get on with things.
But once you realize that people --
that this world was built
by people no smarter than you,
then you can reach out
and touch those walls
and even put your hand through them
and realize that you have
the power to change it.
And when people ask me,
"Are these words real?"
I had a variety of answers
that I tried out.
Some of them made sense.
Some of them didn't.
But one of them I tried out was,
"Well, a word is real
if you want it to be real."
The way that this path is real
because people wanted it to be there.
(Laughter)
It happens on college
campuses all the time.
It's called a "desire path."
(Laughter)
But then I decided,
what people are really asking
when they're asking if a word is real,
they're really asking,
"Well, how many brains
will this give me access to?"
Because I think that's
a lot of how we look at language.
A word is essentially a key
that gets us into certain people's heads.
And if it gets us into one brain,
it's not really worth it,
not really worth knowing.
Two brains, eh, it depends on who it is.
A million brains, OK, now we're talking.
And so a real word is one that gets you
access to as many brains as you can.
That's what makes it worth knowing.
Incidentally, the realest word of all
by this measure is this.
[O.K.]
That's it.
The realest word we have.
That is the closest thing we have
to a master key.
That's the most commonly
understood word in the world,
no matter where you are.
The problem with that is,
no one seems to know
what those two letters stand for.
(Laughter)
Which is kind of weird, right?
I mean, it could be a misspelling
of "all correct," I guess,
or "old kinderhook."
No one really seems to know,
but the fact that it doesn't matter
says something about
how we add meaning to words.
The meaning is not
in the words themselves.
We're the ones
that pour ourselves into it.
And I think, when we're all searching
for meaning in our lives,
and searching for the meaning of life,
I think words have
something to do with that.
And I think if you're looking
for the meaning of something,
the dictionary is a decent place to start.
It brings a sense of order
to a very chaotic universe.
Our view of things is so limited
that we have to come up
with patterns and shorthands
and try to figure out
a way to interpret it
and be able to get on with our day.
We need words to contain us,
to define ourselves.
I think a lot of us feel boxed in
by how we use these words.
We forget that words are made up.
It's not just my words.
All words are made up,
but not all of them mean something.
We're all just sort of
trapped in our own lexicons
that don't necessarily correlate
with people who aren't already like us,
and so I think I feel us drifting apart
a little more every year,
the more seriously we take words.
Because remember, words are not real.
They don't have meaning. We do.
And I'd like to leave you with a reading
from one of my favorite philosophers,
Bill Watterson, who created
"Calvin and Hobbes."
He said,
"Creating a life that reflects
your values and satisfies your soul
is a rare achievement.
To invent your own life's meaning
is not easy,
but it is still allowed,
and I think you'll be
happier for the trouble."
Thank you.
(Applause)
Everything is interconnected.
As a Shinnecock Indian, I was raised to know this.
We are a small fishing tribe
situated on the southeastern tip of Long Island
near the town of Southampton in New York.
When I was a little girl,
my grandfather took me to sit outside in the sun on a hot summer day.
There were no clouds in the sky.
And after a while I began to perspire.
And he pointed up to the sky, and he said,
"Look, do you see that?
That's part of you up there.
That's your water that helps to make the cloud
that becomes the rain that feeds the plants
that feeds the animals."
In my continued exploration of subjects in nature
that have the ability to illustrate the interconnection of all life,
I started storm chasing in 2008
after my daughter said, "Mom, you should do that."
And so three days later, driving very fast,
I found myself stalking a single type of giant cloud called the super cell,
capable of producing grapefruit-size hail
and spectacular tornadoes,
although only two percent actually do.
These clouds can grow so big, up to 50 miles wide
and reach up to 65,000 feet into the atmosphere.
They can grow so big, blocking all daylight,
making it very dark and ominous standing under them.
Storm chasing is a very tactile experience.
There's a warm, moist wind blowing at your back
and the smell of the earth, the wheat, the grass, the charged particles.
And then there are the colors in the clouds
of hail forming, the greens and the turquoise blues.
I've learned to respect the lightning.
My hair used to be straight.
(Laughter)
I'm just kidding.
(Laughter)
What really excites me about these storms
is their movement, the way they swirl and spin and undulate,
with their lava lamp-like mammatus clouds.
They become lovely monsters.
When I'm photographing them,
I cannot help but remember my grandfather's lesson.
As I stand under them,
I see not just a cloud,
but understand that what I have the privilege to witness
is the same forces, the same process in a small-scale version
that helped to create our galaxy, our solar system, our sun
and even this very planet.
All my relations. Thank you.
(Applause)
Can we, as adults, grow new nerve cells?
There's still some confusion
about that question,
as this is a fairly new field of research.
For example, I was talking
to one of my colleagues, Robert,
who is an oncologist,
and he was telling me,
"Sandrine, this is puzzling.
Some of my patients that have been told
they are cured of their cancer
still develop symptoms of depression."
And I responded to him,
"Well, from my point of view
that makes sense.
The drug you give to your patients
that stops the cancer cells multiplying
also stops the newborn neurons
being generated in their brain."
And then Robert looked at me
like I was crazy and said,
"But Sandrine, these are adult patients --
adults do not grow new nerve cells."
And much to his surprise, I said,
"Well actually, we do."
And this is a phenomenon
that we call neurogenesis.
[Neurogenesis]
Now Robert is not a neuroscientist,
and when he went to medical school
he was not taught what we know now --
that the adult brain
can generate new nerve cells.
So Robert, you know,
being the good doctor that he is,
wanted to come to my lab
to understand the topic
a little bit better.
And I took him for a tour
of one of the most exciting
parts of the brain
when it comes to neurogenesis --
and this is the hippocampus.
So this is this gray structure
in the center of the brain.
And what we've known already
for very long,
is that this is important for learning,
memory, mood and emotion.
However, what we
have learned more recently
is that this is one of the unique
structures of the adult brain
where new neurons can be generated.
And if we slice through the hippocampus
and zoom in,
what you actually see here in blue
is a newborn neuron
in an adult mouse brain.
So when it comes to the human brain --
my colleague Jonas Frisén
from the Karolinska Institutet,
has estimated that we produce
700 new neurons per day
in the hippocampus.
You might think this is not much,
compared to the billions
of neurons we have.
But by the time we turn 50,
we will have all exchanged the neurons
we were born with in that structure
with adult-born neurons.
So why are these new neurons important
and what are their functions?
First, we know that they're important
for learning and memory.
And in the lab we have shown
that if we block the ability
of the adult brain
to produce new neurons in the hippocampus,
then we block certain memory abilities.
And this is especially new and true
for spatial recognition --
so like, how you navigate
your way in the city.
We are still learning a lot,
and neurons are not only important
for memory capacity,
but also for the quality of the memory.
And they will have been helpful
to add time to our memory
and they will help differentiate
very similar memories, like:
how do you find your bike
that you park at the station
every day in the same area,
but in a slightly different position?
And more interesting
to my colleague Robert
is the research we have been doing
on neurogenesis and depression.
So in an animal model of depression,
we have seen that we have
a lower level of neurogenesis.
And if we give antidepressants,
then we increase the production
of these newborn neurons,
and we decrease
the symptoms of depression,
establishing a clear link
between neurogenesis and depression.
But moreover, if you
just block neurogenesis,
then you block the efficacy
of the antidepressant.
So by then, Robert had understood
that very likely his patients
were suffering from depression
even after being cured of their cancer,
because the cancer drug had stopped
newborn neurons from being generated.
And it will take time
to generate new neurons
that reach normal functions.
So, collectively, now we think
we have enough evidence
to say that neurogenesis
is a target of choice
if we want to improve
memory formation or mood,
or even prevent the decline
associated with aging,
or associated with stress.
So the next question is:
can we control neurogenesis?
The answer is yes.
And we are now going to do a little quiz.
I'm going to give you a set
of behaviors and activities,
and you tell me if you think
they will increase neurogenesis
or if they will decrease neurogenesis.
Are we ready?
OK, let's go.
So what about learning?
Increasing?
Yes.
Learning will increase the production
of these new neurons.
How about stress?
Yes, stress will decrease the production
of new neurons in the hippocampus.
How about sleep deprivation?
Indeed, it will decrease neurogenesis.
How about sex?
Oh, wow!
(Laughter)
Yes, you are right, it will increase
the production of new neurons.
However, it's all about balance here.
We don't want to fall in a situation --
(Laughter)
about too much sex
leading to sleep deprivation.
(Laughter)
How about getting older?
So the neurogenesis rate
will decrease as we get older,
but it is still occurring.
And then finally, how about running?
I will let you judge that one by yourself.
So this is one of the first studies
that was carried out by one of my mentors,
Rusty Gage from the Salk Institute,
showing that the environment
can have an impact
on the production of new neurons.
And here you see a section
of the hippocampus of a mouse
that had no running wheel in its cage.
And the little black dots you see
are actually newborn neurons-to-be.
And now, you see a section
of the hippocampus of a mouse
that had a running wheel in its cage.
So you see the massive increase
of the black dots representing
the new neurons-to-be.
So activity impacts neurogenesis,
but that's not all.
What you eat will have an effect
on the production of new neurons
in the hippocampus.
So here we have a sample of diet --
of nutrients that have been shown
to have efficacy.
And I'm just going
to point a few out to you:
Calorie restriction of 20 to 30 percent
will increase neurogenesis.
Intermittent fasting --
spacing the time between your meals --
will increase neurogenesis.
Intake of flavonoids,
which are contained
in dark chocolate or blueberries,
will increase neurogenesis.
Omega-3 fatty acids,
present in fatty fish, like salmon,
will increase the production
of these new neurons.
Conversely, a diet rich
in high saturated fat
will have a negative impact
on neurogenesis.
Ethanol -- intake of alcohol --
will decrease neurogenesis.
However, not everything is lost;
resveratrol, which is
contained in red wine,
has been shown to promote
the survival of these new neurons.
So next time you are at a dinner party,
you might want to reach for this possibly
"neurogenesis-neutral" drink.
(Laughter)
And then finally,
let me point out the last one --
a quirky one.
So Japanese groups are fascinated
with food textures,
and they have shown that actually
soft diet impairs neurogenesis,
as opposed to food that requires
mastication -- chewing -- or crunchy food.
So all of this data,
where we need to look
at the cellular level,
has been generated using animal models.
But this diet has also been given
to human participants,
and what we could see is that
the diet modulates memory and mood
in the same direction
as it modulates neurogenesis,
such as: calorie restriction
will improve memory capacity,
whereas a high-fat diet will exacerbate
symptoms of depression --
as opposed to omega-3 fatty acids,
which increase neurogenesis,
and also help to decrease
the symptoms of depression.
So we think that the effect of diet
on mental health, on memory and mood,
is actually mediated by the production
of the new neurons in the hippocampus.
And it's not only what you eat,
but it's also the texture
of the food, when you eat it
and how much of it you eat.
On our side -- neuroscientists
interested in neurogenesis --
we need to understand better
the function of these new neurons,
and how we can control their survival
and their production.
We also need to find a way to protect
the neurogenesis of Robert's patients.
And on your side --
I leave you in charge
of your neurogenesis.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Margaret Heffernan:
Fantastic research, Sandrine.
Now, I told you you changed my life --
I now eat a lot of blueberries.
Sandrine Thuret: Very good.
MH: I'm really interested
in the running thing.
Do I have to run?
Or is it really just
about aerobic exercise,
getting oxygen to the brain?
Could it be any kind of vigorous exercise?
ST: So for the moment,
we can't really say
if it's just the running itself,
but we think that anything that indeed
will increase the production --
or moving the blood flow to the brain,
should be beneficial.
MH: So I don't have to get
a running wheel in my office?
ST: No, you don't!
MH: Oh, what a relief! That's wonderful.
Sandrine Thuret, thank you so much.
ST: Thank you, Margaret.
(Applause)
I love airplanes.
Oh -- I love airplanes.
So, when I went to college
in the late 90s,
it was obvious that I was
going to study aerospace.
And you wouldn't believe
how many people told me,
"Oh no, not aerospace.
Aerospace is going to be boring,
everything in aerospace
has already been done."
Well, they were a little bit off the mark.
And in fact, I think the next decade
is going to be another
golden age for aviation.
For one thing, and this is
where I get excited,
flight is about to get
a lot more personal.
So, a little compare and contrast.
In the last century,
large commercial airplanes
have connected cities across the globe.
And 100 years ago,
it would have been
unthinkable for all of us
to fly here from around the world
for a five-day conference.
But we did, and most of us
probably without a second thought.
And that's a remarkable
achievement for humanity.
But on a day-to-day basis,
we still spend a lot of time in cars.
Or actively trying to avoid it.
Some of my best friends
live in San Francisco,
I live in Mountain View,
about 40 miles away.
We're all busy.
At the end of the day,
we're separated by something like
two hours of heavy traffic.
So frankly, we haven't seen
each other in a few months.
Now, I work in downtown San Jose,
which is near the airport.
And there are actually days
when I can leave work,
get on a plane and fly to Los Angeles
faster than I can drive to San Francisco.
Cities are only getting more populated,
the roads are full, and it's really
difficult to expand them.
And so in a lot of places,
there really aren't a lot
of good solutions
for getting around traffic.
But what if you could fly over it?
The sky is underutilized,
and I would argue it will never be
as congested as the roads are.
First of all, you've got
a whole other dimension,
but also just safety considerations
and air-traffic management
will not allow bumper-to-bumper
traffic in the sky.
Which means, in many cases,
flying can be a long-term,
compelling alternative
to traveling on the ground.
So imagine this:
you call an Uber, it takes you
to a nearby landing spot --
we call these vertiports --
there's an airplane waiting for you there,
flies you over all
of the traffic in the middle,
and on the other side, another Uber
takes you to your friend's house.
And I said Uber,
but I really think we need
to congratulate the Lyft branding team
for their forward thinking
in choosing their brand.
(Laughter)
So in that example,
OK, there are a few extra steps, I admit.
But it's 30 minutes versus two hours,
it costs around 60 dollars,
and you get to fly.
We're not there yet,
but we are a lot closer
than you might think.
So one of the first things we need
is we need an aircraft that can
take off and land in small spaces
and quickly take you where you want to go.
And helicopters can do that today,
but traditionally, helicopters have been
just a little bit too expensive,
just a little too hard to pilot
and just a little too noisy to be used
for daily transportation in cities.
Well, electric flight and autonomy
are changing that.
Electric flight, in particular,
unlocks new possibilities
for vehicle configurations
that we just could not
explore in the past.
If you use electric motors,
you can have many of them
around the aircraft,
and it doesn't add a lot of extra weight.
And that gives you redundancy and safety.
And also, they are cleaner,
cheaper and quieter
than internal combustion engines.
Autonomy allows the transportation
network to scale,
and I actually think
it makes the aircraft safer.
Commercial flights are already automated
for most of their duration,
and I believe there will come a day
when we won't even trust an airplane
that required a human to fly.
So, one of our teams at A3
wanted to see just how close
this future really was.
So they built and flew a prototype
of one such vehicle.
And they made a point of only using
mature, commercially available
technologies today.
We call it Vahana.
It's fully electric.
It takes off and lands vertically,
but flies forward like a regular airplane.
It's fully self-piloted.
You push a button, it takes off,
flies and lands, all by itself.
The prototype that you see here
is designed to carry
a single passenger and luggage.
And it can go about
20 miles in 15 minutes.
And our estimate for a trip like that
is it would cost around 40 dollars,
which you can really
build a business around.
It has multiple redundant
motors and batteries,
you can lose one, it will continue
flying and land normally.
It's pretty quiet.
When it's flying overhead, it will be
quieter than a Prius on the highway.
It's intelligent and has cameras,
lidar and radar,
so it can detect and avoid
unexpected obstacles.
And the team really focused
on making it efficient,
so the batteries are small, light,
and they last longer.
For reference, the Vahana battery
is less than half the size
of a Tesla Model S battery.
It's about 40 kilowatt-hours.
And you can hot swap the batteries
in just a few minutes.
And I do think that in a few years,
people will be comfortable
getting by themselves
in a self-piloted, electric,
VTOL air taxi.
But the team is busy
working on the next version,
which is going to carry
at least two passengers
and fly quite a bit farther.
But more importantly, there are
over 20 companies around the world
working on vehicles
just like this one right now.
My best guess is in the next five years,
you'll start seeing
vertiports in some cities,
and little airplane icons
on your ride-sharing apps.
And it might begin with a dozen,
but eventually, we could have
hundreds of these,
flying around our cities.
And it will fundamentally transform
our relationship with local travel.
In the past century,
flight connected our planet,
in the next, it will reconnect
our local communities,
and I hope it will
reconnect us to each other.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Chris Anderson: OK, so when
these things first roll out --
right now, it's a single
person aircraft, right?
Rodin Lyasoff: Ours is, yes.
CA: Yours is.
I mean, someone comes out of their car,
the door opens, they get in,
there's no one else in there.
This thing takes off.
Could we do a poll here?
Because these are
early adopters in this room.
I want to know who here is excited
about the idea of being picked up solo
in an auto-flying --
Well, there you go!
RL: It's pretty good.
CA: That is pretty awesome,
half of TED is completely
stark staring bonkers.
(Laughter)
RL: So, one of the things
we're really focusing on
is, really, the cost.
So you can really wrap
a business around that.
And so, that's why some of the features
are really driven by price.
And the 40-dollar price tag
is really a target that we're aiming for.
Which should make it accessible
to a larger crowd than this one.
CA: The biggest blockage
in terms of when this rolls out
is probably not the technology
at this point -- it's regulation, right?
RL: That's probably true, yes,
I would agree with that.
The technology need to mature
in terms of safety,
to get to the safety levels
that we expect from aircraft.
But I don't think there are
any blockers there,
just work needs to get done.
CA: So, first, this is ride sharing.
Are we that far away from a time
when lots of people have
one of these in their garage
and just kind of, go direct
to their friend's house?
RL: My personal view is that ride sharing
actually allows you to operate
that entire business
much more efficiently.
You know, there are millennials
that say they never want to own a car.
I think they'll probably feel
even stronger about aircraft.
So --
(Laughter)
I really think that the network
scales and operates a lot better
as a ride-sharing platform,
also because the integration
with air-traffic management
works a lot better
if it's handled centrally.
CA: Cool. Thank you for that.
RL: Thank you.
CA: That was amazing.
Over our lifetimes,
we've all contributed to climate change.
Actions, choices and behaviors
will have led to an increase
in greenhouse gas emissions.
And I think that that's
quite a powerful thought.
But it does have the potential
to make us feel guilty
when we think about decisions
we might have made
around where to travel to,
how often and how,
about the energy that we choose to use
in our homes or in our workplaces,
or quite simply the lifestyles
that we lead and enjoy.
But we can also turn
that thought on its head,
and think that if we've had
such a profound
but a negative impact
on our climate already,
then we have an opportunity to influence
the amount of future climate change
that we will need to adapt to.
So we have a choice.
We can either choose to start
to take climate change seriously,
and significantly cut and mitigate
our greenhouse gas emissions,
and then we will have to adapt to less
of the climate change impacts in future.
Alternatively, we can continue to really
ignore the climate change problem.
But if we do that, we are also choosing
to adapt to very much more powerful
climate impacts in future.
And not only that.
As people who live in countries
with high per capita emissions,
we're making that choice
on behalf of others as well.
But the choice that we don't have
is a no climate change future.
Over the last two decades,
our government negotiators
and policymakers have been coming together
to discuss climate change,
and they've been focused on
avoiding a two-degree centigrade warming
above pre-industrial levels.
That's the temperature that's associated
with dangerous impacts
across a range of different indicators,
to humans and to the environment.
So two degrees centigrade
constitutes dangerous climate change.
But dangerous climate change
can be subjective.
So if we think about
an extreme weather event
that might happen
in some part of the world,
and if that happens in a part of the world
where there is good infrastructure,
where there are people
that are well-insured and so on,
then that impact can be disruptive.
It can cause upset, it could cause cost.
It could even cause some deaths.
But if that exact same weather event
happens in a part of the world
where there is poor infrastructure,
or where people are not well-insured,
or they're not having
good support networks,
then that same climate change impact
could be devastating.
It could cause a significant loss of home,
but it could also cause
significant amounts of death.
So this is a graph of the CO2 emissions
at the left-hand side
from fossil fuel and industry,
and time from before
the Industrial Revolution
out towards the present day.
And what's immediately striking about this
is that emissions
have been growing exponentially.
If we focus in on a shorter
period of time from 1950,
we have established in 1988
the Intergovernmental Panel
on Climate Change,
the Rio Earth Summit in 1992,
then rolling on a few years,
in 2009 we had the Copenhagen Accord,
where it established avoiding
a two-degree temperature rise
in keeping with the science
and on the basis of equity.
And then in 2012, we had the Rio+20 event.
And all the way through,
during all of these meetings
and many others as well,
emissions have continued to rise.
And if we focus on our historical
emission trend in recent years,
and we put that together
with our understanding
of the direction of travel
in our global economy,
then we are much more on track
for a four-degree centigrade
global warming
than we are for the two-degree centigrade.
Now, let's just pause for a moment
and think about this four-degree
global average temperature.
Most of our planet
is actually made up of the sea.
Now, because the sea has a greater
thermal inertia than the land,
the average temperatures over land
are actually going to be higher
than they are over the sea.
The second thing is that we
as human beings don't experience
global average temperatures.
We experience hot days, cold days,
rainy days, especially if you live
in Manchester like me.
So now put yourself in a city center.
Imagine somewhere in the world:
Mumbai, Beijing, New York, London.
It's the hottest day
that you've ever experienced.
There's sun beating down,
there's concrete and glass all around you.
Now imagine that same day --
but it's six, eight,
maybe 10 to 12 degrees warmer
on that day during that heat wave.
That's the kind of thing
we're going to experience
under a four-degree global
average temperature scenario.
And the problem with these extremes,
and not just the temperature extremes,
but also the extremes in terms of storms
and other climate impacts,
is our infrastructure is just not set up
to deal with these sorts of events.
So our roads and our rail networks
have been designed to last for a long time
and withstand only
certain amounts of impacts
in different parts of the world.
And this is going to be
extremely challenged.
Our power stations
are expected to be cooled by water
to a certain temperature
to remain effective and resilient.
And our buildings
are designed to be comfortable
within a particular temperature range.
And this is all going to be
significantly challenged
under a four-degree-type scenario.
Our infrastructure has not been
designed to cope with this.
So if we go back, also thinking
about four degrees,
it's not just the direct impacts,
but also some indirect impacts.
So if we take food security, for example.
Maize and wheat yields
in some parts of the world
are expected to be up to 40 percent lower
under a four-degree scenario,
rice up to 30 percent lower.
This will be absolutely devastating
for global food security.
So all in all, the kinds
of impacts anticipated
under this four-degree centigrade scenario
are going to be incompatible
with global organized living.
So back to our trajectories and our graphs
of four degrees and two degrees.
Is it reasonable still
to focus on the two-degree path?
There are quite a lot of my colleagues
and other scientists
who would say that it's now too late
to avoid a two-degree warming.
But I would just like
to draw on my own research
on energy systems, on food systems,
aviation and also shipping,
just to say that I think there is still
a small fighting chance
of avoiding this two-degree
dangerous climate change.
But we really need
to get to grips with the numbers
to work out how to do it.
So if you focus in on this trajectory
and these graphs,
the yellow circle there
highlights that the departure
from the red four-degree pathway
to the two-degree
green pathway is immediate.
And that's because
of cumulative emissions,
or the carbon budget.
So in other words, because
of the lights and the projectors
that are on in this room right now,
the CO2 that is going into our atmosphere
as a result of that
electricity consumption
lasts a very long time.
Some of it will be in our atmosphere
for a century, maybe much longer.
It will accumulate, and greenhouse gases
tend to be cumulative.
And that tells us something
about these trajectories.
First of all, it tells us that it's
the area under these curves that matter,
not where we reach
at a particular date in future.
And that's important,
because it doesn't matter
if we come up with some amazing
whiz-bang technology
to sort out our energy problem
on the last day of 2049,
just in the nick of time
to sort things out.
Because in the meantime,
emissions will have accumulated.
So if we continue on this red,
four-degree centigrade scenario pathway,
the longer we continue on it,
that will need to be
made up for in later years
to keep the same carbon budget,
to keep the same area under the curve,
which means that that trajectory,
the red one there, becomes steeper.
So in other words, if we don't reduce
emissions in the short to medium term,
then we'll have to make more significant
year-on-year emission reductions.
We also know that we have
to decarbonize our energy system.
But if we don't start to cut
emissions in the short to medium term,
then we will have to do that even sooner.
So this poses really big
challenges for us.
The other thing it does is tells us
something about energy policy.
If you live in a part of the world where
per capita emissions are already high,
it points us towards
reducing energy demand.
And that's because
with all the will in the world,
the large-scale engineering infrastructure
that we need to roll out rapidly
to decarbonize the supply side
of our energy system
is just simply not going
to happen in time.
So it doesn't matter
whether we choose nuclear power
or carbon capture and storage,
upscale our biofuel production,
or go for a much bigger roll-out
of wind turbines and wave turbines.
All of that will take time.
So because it's the area
under the curve that matters,
we need to focus on energy efficiency,
but also on energy conservation --
in other words, using less energy.
And if we do that, that also means
that as we continue to roll out
the supply-side technology,
we will have less of a job to do
if we've actually managed
to reduce our energy consumption,
because we will then need
less infrastructure on the supply side.
Another issue that we really
need to grapple with
is the issue of well-being and equity.
There are many parts of the world where
the standard of living needs to rise.
Bbut with energy systems
currently reliant on fossil fuel,
as those economies grow
so will emissions.
And now, if we're all constrained
by the same amount of carbon budget,
that means that if some parts of
the world's emissions are needing to rise,
then other parts of the world's
emissions need to reduce.
So that poses very significant challenges
for wealthy nations.
Because according to our research,
if you're in a country where per capita
emissions are really high --
so North America, Europe, Australia --
emissions reductions of the order
of 10 percent per year,
and starting immediately,
will be required for a good chance
of avoiding the two-degree target.
Let me just put that into context.
The economist Nicholas Stern
said that emission reductions
of more than one percent per year
had only ever been associated
with economic recession or upheaval.
So this poses huge challenges
for the issue of economic growth,
because if we have our
high carbon infrastructure in place,
it means that if our economies grow,
then so do our emissions.
So I'd just like to take
a quote from a paper
by myself and Kevin Anderson back in 2011
where we said that to avoid the two-degree
framing of dangerous climate change,
economic growth needs to be exchanged
at least temporarily
for a period of planned austerity
in wealthy nations.
This is a really difficult
message to take,
because what it suggests is that
we really need to do things differently.
This is not about just incremental change.
This is about doing things differently,
about whole system change,
and sometimes
it's about doing less things.
And this applies to all of us,
whatever sphere of influence we have.
So it could be from writing
to our local politician
to talking to our boss at work
or being the boss at work,
or talking with our friends and family,
or, quite simply, changing our lifestyles.
Because we really need
to make significant change.
At the moment, we're choosing
a four-degree scenario.
If we really want to avoid
the two-degree scenario,
there really is no time
like the present to act.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Bruno Giussani: Alice,
basically what you're saying,
the talk is, unless wealthy nations
start cutting 10 percent per year
the emissions now, this year,
not in 2020 or '25,
we are going to go straight
to the four-plus-degree scenario.
I am wondering what's your take
on the cut by 70 percent for 2070.
Alice Bows-Larkin: Yeah, it's just
nowhere near enough to avoid two degrees.
One of the things that often --
when there are these modeling studies
that look at what we need to do,
is they tend to hugely overestimate
how quickly other countries in the world
can start to reduce emissions.
So they make kind of
heroic assumptions about that.
The more we do that,
because it's the cumulative emissions,
the short-term stuff that really matters.
So it does make a huge difference.
If a big country like China, for example,
continues to grow
even for just a few extra years,
that will make a big difference
to when we need to decarbonize.
So I don't think we can even say
when it will be,
because it all depends
on what we have to do in the short term.
But I think we've just got huge scope,
and we don't pull those levers
that allow us to reduce
the energy demand, which is a shame.
BG: Alice, thank you for coming
to TED and sharing this data.
ABL: Thank you.
(Applause)
So, Ma was trying to explain
something to me
about Grandma and when they grew up,
but I couldn't pay attention to her
because I was five years old,
and I was petrified.
I had just seen The Green Lady.
Now, about a week earlier,
I'd watched that movie "Godzilla,"
the one about that huge lizard-like beast
storming a major city,
and the thought of a green monster
coming for me was stuck in my mind.
And yet there I was,
at the tip of Lower Manhattan with my mom,
just staring at her:
her horns,
her muscles --
all of it just frightened me.
And I didn't know
whether she was a monster or a hero.
So I decided to consult
the Google of the day --
"Ma! Ma!"
(Laughter)
My mother explained that The Green Lady
is actually the Statue of Liberty
and that she was waving immigrants in.
Now, the part of her explanation
that really messed with my young head
was the fact that, according to Ma,
long before us,
The Green Lady was actually brown,
brown like me,
and that she changed
colors over the years,
much like America.
Now, the part that really
is intriguing about this
is that when she changed colors,
she made me think about myself.
It all made sense to me,
because as a first-generation American,
I was surrounded by immigrants.
In fact, within my immediate social circle
of the people who support me,
who enrich my life,
at least two are foreign-born.
My life as a US citizen is in many ways
shaped by newcomers,
and chances are,
so is yours.
There are more than 40 million
immigrants in the USA.
According to census data,
a quarter of the nation's children
have at least one foreign-born parent.
I know all these statistics
because I study global migration patterns.
I'm a journalist,
and for the last few years,
I've been documenting
the lives of US citizens
who've lost people to deportation.
And the numbers are enormous.
From 2008 to 2016,
more than three million people
were "ordered removed" --
that's the technical term
for being deported.
There is an economic, a political,
a psychological and an emotional cost
to those deportations --
the moments when these circles are broken.
I once asked a US soldier,
"Why did you volunteer to fight this war?"
And she told me,
"Because I'm proud to defend my country."
But I pressed to know --
"Really, when you're on base,
and you hear bombs
exploding in the distance,
and you see soldiers coming back
who are gravely injured,
in that moment,
when you know you could be next,
what does 'my country' mean?"
She looked at me.
"My country is my wife,
my family,
my friends, my soldiers."
What she was telling me
is that "my country" is a collection
of these strong relationships;
these social circles.
When the social circles are weakened,
a country itself is weaker.
We're missing a crucial aspect
in the debate about immigration policy.
Rather than focusing on individuals,
we should focus
on the circles around them,
because these are the people
who are left behind:
the voters, the taxpayers,
the ones who are suffering that loss.
And it's not just the children
of the deported
who are impacted.
You have brothers and sisters
who are separated by borders.
You have classmates, teachers,
law enforcement officers,
technologists, scientists, doctors,
who are all scrambling
to make sense of new realities
when their social circles are broken.
These are the real lives
behind all these statistics
that dominate discussions
about immigration policy.
But we don't often think about them.
And I'm trying to change that.
Here's just one of the real-life stories
that I've collected.
And it still haunts me.
I met Ramon and his son in 2016,
the same year both of them
were being ordered out of the country.
Ramon was being deported to Latin America,
while his son, who was a sergeant
in the US military,
was being deployed.
Deported ...
deployed.
If you just look at Ramon's case,
it wouldn't be clear how deeply
connected to the country he is.
But consider his son:
a US citizen defending a country
that's banished his father.
The social circle is what's key here.
Here's another example
that illustrates those critical bonds.
A group of citizens in Philadelphia
were concerned about their jobs,
because the legal owner
of the restaurant where they worked
was an undocumented immigrant,
and immigration officials
had picked him up.
They rallied behind him.
An immigration lawyer argued
he was too important
to the local community
to be deported.
At the hearing, they even submitted
restaurant reviews --
restaurant reviews!
In the end, a judge exercised
what's called "judicial discretion"
and allowed him to stay in the country,
but only because they considered
the social circle.
There are 23 million
noncitizens in the USA,
according to verifiable federal data.
And that doesn't include the undocumented,
because numbers for that population
are at best complex estimates.
Let's just work with what we have.
That's 23 million social circles --
about 100 million individuals
whose lives could be impacted
by deportation.
And the stress of it all is trickling down
through the population.
A 2017 poll by UCLA of LA County residents
found that 30 percent
of citizens in LA County
are stressed about deportation,
not because they themselves
could be removed,
but rather, because members
of their social circle were at risk.
I am not suggesting that no one
should ever be deported;
don't confuse me with that.
But what I am saying is that we need
to look at the bigger picture.
If you are within the sound of my voice,
I want you to close your eyes for a moment
and examine your own social circle.
Who are your foreign-born?
What would it feel like
if the circle were broken?
Share your story.
I'm building a global archive
of first-person accounts
and linking them with mapping technology,
so that we can see exactly
where these circles break,
because this is not
just an American issue.
There are a quarter-billion migrants
around the world;
people living, loving and learning
in countries where they were not born.
And in my career, in my life,
I've been one of them:
in China, in Africa, in Europe.
And each time I become
one of these foreigners --
one of these strange-looking
guys in a new land --
I can't help but think back to that day
when I was in Lower Manhattan with my mom
all those decades ago,
when I was scared,
and I had just spotted that green lady.
And I guess the question
that I keep on thinking about
when I see her
and all the younger replicas of her
that are so obviously brown,
and even the paintings
that showcase her in the beginning
as not quite green --
when I look at all of that,
the question that my research
seeks to answer
becomes, to me, the same one
that confounded me all those years ago:
Is she a monster
or a hero?
Thank you.
(Applause)
At 7:45 a.m., I open the doors to a building
dedicated to building, yet only breaks me down.
I march down hallways cleaned up after me every day
by regular janitors,
but I never have the decency to honor their names.
Lockers left open like teenage boys' mouths
when teenage girls wear clothes that covers
their insecurities but exposes everything else.
Masculinity mimicked by men who grew up with no fathers,
camouflage worn by bullies who are dangerously armed
but need hugs.
Teachers paid less than what it costs them to be here.
Oceans of adolescents come here to receive lessons
but never learn to swim,
part like the Red Sea when the bell rings.
This is a training ground.
My high school is Chicago,
diverse and segregated on purpose.
Social lines are barbed wire.
Labels like "Regulars" and "Honors" resonate.
I am an Honors but go home with Regular students
who are soldiers in territory that owns them.
This is a training ground to sort out the Regulars
from the Honors, a reoccurring cycle
built to recycle the trash of this system.
Trained at a young age to capitalize,
letters taught now that capitalism raises you
but you have to step on someone else to get there.
This is a training ground where one group
is taught to lead and the other is made to follow.
No wonder so many of my people spit bars,
because the truth is hard to swallow.
The need for degrees has left so many people frozen.
Homework is stressful,
but when you go home every day and your home is work,
you don't want to pick up any assignments.
Reading textbooks is stressful,
but reading does not matter when you feel
your story is already written,
either dead or getting booked.
Taking tests is stressful,
but bubbling in a Scantron does not stop
bullets from bursting.
I hear education systems are failing,
but I believe they're succeeding at what they're built to do --
to train you, to keep you on track,
to track down an American dream that has failed
so many of us all.
(Applause)
"Will the blight end the chestnut?
The farmers rather guess not.
It keeps smouldering at the roots
And sending up new shoots
Till another parasite
Shall come to end the blight."
At the beginning of the 20th century,
the eastern American chestnut population,
counting nearly four billion trees,
was completely decimated
by a fungal infection.
Fungi are the most destructive
pathogens of plants,
including crops of major
economic importance.
Can you imagine that today,
crop losses associated
with fungal infection
are estimated at billions of dollars
per year, worldwide?
That represents enough food calories
to feed half a billion people.
And this leads to severe repercussions,
including episodes of famine
in developing countries,
large reduction of income
for farmers and distributors,
high prices for consumers
and risk of exposure to mycotoxin,
poison produced by fungi.
The problems that we face
is that the current method
used to prevent and treat
those dreadful diseases,
such as genetic control,
exploiting natural sources of resistance,
crop rotation or seed
treatment, among others,
are still limited or ephemeral.
They have to be constantly renewed.
Therefore, we urgently need
to develop more efficient strategies
and for this, research is required
to identify biological mechanisms
that can be targeted
by novel antifungal treatments.
One feature of fungi
is that they cannot move
and only grow by extension
to form a sophisticated network,
the mycelium.
In 1884, Anton de Bary,
the father of plant pathology,
was the first to presume
that fungi are guided by signals
sent out from the host plant,
meaning a plant upon which
it can lodge and subsist,
so signals act as a lighthouse
for fungi to locate, grow toward, reach
and finally invade and colonize a plant.
He knew that the identification
of such signals
would unlock a great knowledge
that then serves to elaborate strategy
to block the interaction
between the fungus and the plant.
However, the lack of an appropriate
method at that moment
prevented him from identifying
this mechanism at the molecular level.
Using purification and mutational
genomic approaches,
as well as a technique
allowing the measurement
of directed hyphal growth,
today I'm glad to tell you
that after 130 years,
my former team and I
could finally identify such plant signals
by studying the interaction
between a pathogenic fungus
called Fusarium oxysporum
and one of its host plants,
the tomato plant.
As well, we could characterize
the fungal receptor
receiving those signals
and part of the underlying reaction
occurring within the fungus
and leading to its direct growth
toward the plant.
(Applause)
Thank you.
(Applause)
The understanding
of such molecular processes
offers a panel of potential molecules
that can be used to create
novel antifungal treatments.
And those treatments would disrupt
the interaction between
the fungus and the plant
either by blocking the plant signal
or the fungal reception system
which receives those signals.
Fungal infections have devastated
agriculture crops.
Moreover, we are now in an era
where the demand of crop production
is increasing significantly.
And this is due to population growth,
economic development,
climate change and demand for bio fuels.
Our understanding
of the molecular mechanism
of interaction between
a fungus and its host plant,
such as the tomato plant,
potentially represents a major step
towards developing more efficient strategy
to combat plant fungal diseases
and therefore solving of problems
that affect people's lives,
food security and economic growth.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Twelve years ago, I was in the street writing my name
to say, "I exist."
Then I went to taking photos of people to paste them on the street
to say, "They exist."
From the suburbs of Paris to the wall of Israel and Palestine,
the rooftops of Kenya
to the favelas of Rio,
paper and glue -- as easy as that.
I asked a question last year:
Can art change the world?
Well let me tell you,
in terms of changing the world there has been a lot of competition this year,
because the Arab Spring is still spreading,
the Eurozone has collapsed ... what else?
The Occupy movement found a voice,
and I still have to speak English constantly.
So there has been a lot of change.
So when I had my TED wish last year,
I said, look, I'm going to switch my concept.
You are going to take the photos.
You're going to send them to me.
I'm going to print them and send them back to you.
Then you're going to paste them where it makes sense
for you to place your own statement.
This is Inside Out.
One hundred thousand posters have been printed this year.
Those are the kind of posters, let me show you.
And we keep sending more every day.
This is the size.
Just a regular piece of paper with a little bit of ink on it.
This one was from Haiti.
When I launched my wish last year,
hundreds of people stood up and said they wanted to help us.
But I say it has to be
under the conditions I've always worked:
no credit, no logos, no sponsoring.
A week later, a handful of people were there ready to rock
and empower the people on the ground
who wanted to change the world.
These are the people I want to talk about to you today.
Two weeks after my speech, in Tunisia,
hundreds of portraits were made.
And they pasted [over] every single portrait of the dictator
[with] their own photos.
Boom! This is what happened.
Slim and his friends went through the country
and pasted hundreds of photos everywhere
to show the diversity in the country.
They really make Inside Out their own project.
Actually, that photo was pasted in a police station,
and what you see on the ground
are ID cards of all the photos of people being tracked by the police.
Russia. Chad wanted to fight against homophobia in Russia.
He went with his friends in front of every Russian embassy in Europe
and stood there with the photos
to say, "We have rights."
They used Inside Out as a platform for protest.
Karachi, Pakistan.
Sharmeen is actually here.
She organized a TEDx action out there
and made all the unseen faces of the city
on the walls in her town.
And I want to thank her today.
North Dakota. Standing Rock Nation,
in this Turtle Island, [unclear name] from the Dakota Lakota tribe
wanted to show that the Native Americans are still here.
The seventh generation are still fighting for their rights.
He pasted up portraits all over his reservation.
And he's here also today.
Each time I get a wall in New York,
I use his photos to continue spreading the project.
Juarez: You've heard of the border --
one of the most dangerous borders in the world.
Monica has taken thousands of portraits with a group of photographers
and covered the entire border.
Do you know what it takes to do this?
People, energy, make the glue, organize the team.
It was amazing.
While in Iran at the same time
Abololo -- of course a nickname --
has pasted one single face of a woman
to show his resistance against the government.
I don't have to explain to you what kind of risk he took for that action.
There are tons of school projects.
Twenty percent of the posters we are receiving comes from schools.
Education is so essential.
Kids just make photos in a class, the teacher receives them,
they paste them on the school.
Here they even got the help of the firemen.
There should be even more schools doing this kind of project.
Of course we wanted to go back to Israel and Palestine.
So we went there with a truck. This is a photobooth truck.
You go on the back of that truck, it takes your photo,
30 seconds later take it from the side, you're ready to rock.
Thousands of people use them
and each of them signs up for a two-state peace solution
and then walk in the street.
This is march, the 450,000 march -- beginning of September.
They were all holding their photo as a statement.
On the other side, people were wrapping up streets, buildings.
It's everywhere.
Come on, don't tell me that people aren't ready for peace out there.
These projects took thousands of actions in one year,
making hundreds of thousands of people participating,
creating millions of views.
This is the biggest global art participatory project that's going on.
So back to the question, "Can art change the world?"
Maybe not in one year. That's the beginning.
But maybe we should change the question.
Can art change people's lives?
From what I've seen this year, yes.
And you know what? It's just the beginning.
Let's turn the world inside out together.
Thank you.
(Applause)
I want to tell you about someone.
I'm going to call him Ravi Nanda.
I'm changing his name
to protect his safety.
Ravi's from a community
of herdspeople in Gujarat
on the western coast of India,
same place my own family comes from.
When he was 10 years old,
his entire community was forced to move
because a multinational corporation
constructed a manufacturing facility
on the land where they lived.
Then, 20 years later,
the same company built a cement factory
100 meters from where they live now.
India has got strong
environmental regulations on paper,
but this company
has violated many of them.
Dust from that factory
covers Ravi's mustache
and everything he wears.
I spent just two days in his place,
and I coughed for a week.
Ravi says that if people or animals
eat anything that grows in his village
or drink the water,
they get sick.
He says children now walk
long distances with cattle and buffalo
to find uncontaminated grazing land.
He says many of those kids
have dropped out of school,
including three of his own.
Ravi has appealed
to the company for years.
He said, "I've written so many letters
my family could cremate me with them.
They wouldn't need to buy any wood."
(Laughter)
He said the company ignored
every one of those letters,
and so in 2013,
Ravi Nanda decided to use
the last means of protest
he thought he had left.
He walked to the gates of that factory
with a bucket of petrol in his hands,
intending to set himself on fire.
Ravi is not alone in his desperation.
The UN estimates that worldwide,
four billion people live
without basic access to justice.
These people face grave threats
to their safety, their livelihoods,
their dignity.
There are almost always laws on the books
that would protect these people,
but they've often
never heard of those laws,
and the systems that are supposed
to enforce those laws
are corrupt or broken or both.
We are living with a global
epidemic of injustice,
but we've been choosing to ignore it.
Right now, in Sierra Leone,
in Cambodia, in Ethiopia,
farmers are being cajoled
into putting their thumbprints
on 50-year lease agreements,
signing away all the land
they've ever known for a pittance
without anybody even explaining the terms.
Governments seem to think that's OK.
Right now, in the United States,
in India, in Slovenia,
people like Ravi
are raising their children
in the shadow of factories or mines
that are poisoning
their air and their water.
There are environmental laws
that would protect these people,
but many have never seen those laws,
let alone having a shot at enforcing them.
And the world seems
to have decided that's OK.
What would it take to change that?
Law is supposed to be the language we use
to translate our dreams about justice
into living institutions
that hold us together.
Law is supposed to be the difference
between a society
ruled by the most powerful
and one that honors
the dignity of everyone,
strong or weak.
That's why I told
my grandmother 20 years ago
that I wanted to go to law school.
Grandma didn't pause.
She didn't skip a beat.
She said to me, "Lawyer is liar."
(Laughter)
That was discouraging.
(Laughter)
But grandma's right, in a way.
Something about law
and lawyers has gone wrong.
We lawyers are usually
expensive, first of all,
and we tend to focus
on formal court channels
that are impractical
for many of the problems people face.
Worse, our profession has shrouded law
in a cloak of complexity.
Law is like riot gear on a police officer.
It's intimidating and impenetrable,
and it's hard to tell
there's something human underneath.
If we're going to make justice
a reality for everyone,
we need to turn law
from an abstraction or a threat
into something that every single person
can understand, use and shape.
Lawyers are crucial
in that fight, no doubt,
but we can't leave it to lawyers alone.
In health care, for example,
we don't just rely
on doctors to serve patients.
We have nurses and midwives
and community health workers.
The same should be true of justice.
Community legal workers,
sometimes we call them
community paralegals,
or barefoot lawyers,
can be a bridge.
These paralegals are from
the communities they serve.
They demystify law,
break it down into simple terms,
and then they help people
look for a solution.
They don't focus on the courts alone.
They look everywhere:
ministry departments,
local government, an ombudsman's office.
Lawyers sometimes say to their clients,
"I'll handle it for you. I've got you."
Paralegals have a different message,
not "I'm going to solve it for you,"
but "We're going to solve it together,
and in the process,
we're both going to grow."
Community paralegals
saved my own relationship to law.
After about a year in law school,
I almost dropped out.
I was thinking maybe I should
have listened to my grandmother.
It was when I started
working with paralegals
in Sierra Leone, in 2003,
that I began feeling hopeful
about the law again,
and I have been obsessed ever since.
Let me come back to Ravi.
2013, he did reach
the gates of that factory
with the bucket of petrol in his hands,
but he was arrested
before he could follow through.
He didn't have to spend long in jail,
but he felt completely defeated.
Then, two years later, he met someone.
I'm going to call him Kush.
Kush is part of a team
of community paralegals
that works for environmental justice
on the Gujarat coast.
Kush explained to Ravi
that there was law on his side.
Kush translated into Gujarati
something Ravi had never seen.
It's called the "consent to operate."
It's issued by the state government,
and it allows the factory to run
only if it complies
with specific conditions.
So together, they compared
the legal requirements with reality,
they collected evidence,
and they drafted an application --
not to the courts,
but to two administrative institutions,
the Pollution Control Board
and the district administration.
Those applications started turning
the creaky wheels of enforcement.
A pollution officer
came for a site inspection,
and after that, the company
started running an air filtration system
it was supposed to have
been using all along.
It also started covering the 100 trucks
that come and go
from that plant every day.
Those two measures
reduced the air pollution considerably.
The case is far from over,
but learning and using law gave Ravi hope.
There are people like Kush
walking alongside people like Ravi
in many places.
Today, I work with a group called Namati.
Namati helps convene a global network
dedicated to legal empowerment.
All together, we are over
a thousand organizations
in 120 countries.
Collectively, we deploy
tens of thousands of community paralegals.
Let me give you another example.
This is Khadija Hamsa.
She is one of five million people in Kenya
who faces a discriminatory vetting process
when trying to obtain a national ID card.
It is like the Jim Crow South
in the United States.
If you are from a certain set of tribes,
most of them Muslim,
you get sent to a different line.
Without an ID, you can't apply for a job.
You can't get a bank loan.
You can't enroll in university.
You are excluded from society.
Khadija tried off and on to get an ID
for eight years, without success.
Then she met a paralegal
working in her community
named Hassan Kassim.
Hassan explained to Khadija
how vetting works,
he helped her gather
the documents she needed,
helped prep her to go before
the vetting committee.
Finally, she was able to get an ID
with Hassan's help.
First thing she did with it
was use it to apply
for birth certificates for her children,
which they need in order to go to school.
In the United States,
among many other problems,
we have a housing crisis.
In many cities,
90 percent of the landlords
in housing court have attorneys,
while 90 percent of the tenants do not.
In New York, a new crew of paralegals --
they're called
Access to Justice Navigators --
helps people to understand housing law
and to advocate for themselves.
Normally in New York,
one out of nine tenants
brought to housing court
gets evicted.
Researchers took a look at 150 cases
in which people had help
from these paralegals,
and they found no evictions at all,
not one.
A little bit of legal empowerment
can go a long way.
I see the beginnings of a real movement,
but we're nowhere near what's necessary.
Not yet.
In most countries around the world,
governments do not provide
a single dollar of support
to paralegals like Hassan and Kush.
Most governments don't even recognize
the role paralegals play,
or protect paralegals from harm.
I also don't want
to give you the impression
that paralegals and their clients
win every time.
Not at all.
That cement factory behind Ravi's village,
it's been turning off
the filtration system at night,
when it's least likely
that the company would get caught.
Running that filter costs money.
Ravi WhatsApps photos
of the polluted night sky.
This is one he sent to Kush in May.
Ravi says the air is still unbreathable.
At one point this year,
Ravi went on hunger strike.
Kush was frustrated.
He said, "We can win if we use the law."
Ravi said, "I believe in the law, I do,
but it's not getting us far enough."
Whether it's India, Kenya,
the United States or anywhere else,
trying to squeeze justice
out of broken systems
is like Ravi's case.
Hope and despair are neck and neck.
And so not only do we urgently need
to support and protect
the work of barefoot lawyers
around the world,
we need to change the systems themselves.
Every case a paralegal takes on
is a story about how a system
is working in practice.
When you put those stories together,
it gives you a detailed portrait
of the system as a whole.
People can use that information
to demand improvements
to laws and policies.
In India, paralegals and clients
have drawn on their case experience
to propose smarter regulations
for the handling of minerals.
In Kenya, paralegals and clients
are using data from thousands of cases
to argue that vetting is unconstitutional.
This is a different way
of approaching reform.
This is not a consultant
flying into Myanmar
with a template he's going
to cut and paste from Macedonia,
and this is not an angry tweet.
This is about growing reforms
from the experience of ordinary people
trying to make the rules and systems work.
This transformation in the relationship
between people and law
is the right thing to do.
It's also essential for overcoming
all of the other
great challenges of our times.
We are not going to avert
environmental collapse
if the people most affected by pollution
don't have a say in what happens
to the land and the water,
and we won't succeed in reducing poverty
or expanding opportunity
if poor people can't exercise
their basic rights.
And I believe we won't overcome
the despair that authoritarian
politicians prey upon
if our systems stay rigged.
I called Ravi before coming here
to ask permission to share his story.
I asked if there was any message
he wanted to give people.
He said, "[Gujarati]."
Wake up.
"[Gujarati]."
Don't be afraid.
"[Gujarati]."
Fight with paper.
By that I think he means
fight using law rather than guns.
"[Gujarati]."
Maybe not today, maybe not this year,
maybe not in five years,
but find justice.
If this guy, whose entire community
is being poisoned every single day,
who was ready to take his own life --
if he's not giving up on seeking justice,
then the world can't give up either.
Ultimately, what Ravi calls
"fighting with paper"
is about forging a deeper
version of democracy
in which we the people,
we don't just cast ballots
every few years,
we take part daily in the rules
and institutions that hold us together,
in which everyone,
even the least powerful,
can know law, use law and shape law.
Making that happen, winning that fight,
requires all of us.
Thank you guys. Thank you.
(Applause)
Kelo Kubu: Thanks, Vivek.
So I'm going to make a few assumptions
that people in this room know
what the Sustainable Development Goals are
and how the process works,
but I want us to talk a little bit
about Goal 16: Peace, justice
and strong institutions.
Vivek Maru: Yeah. Anybody remember
the Millennium Development Goals?
They were adopted in 2000 by the UN
and governments around the world,
and they were for essential,
laudable things.
It was reduce child mortality
by two thirds, cut hunger in half,
crucial things.
But there was no mention
of justice or fairness
or accountability or corruption,
and we have made progress
during the 15 years
when those goals were in effect,
but we are way behind
what justice demands,
and we're not going to get there
unless we take justice into account.
And so when the debate started
about the next development framework,
the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals,
our community came together
around the world
to argue that access to justice
and legal empowerment
should be a part of that new framework.
And there was a lot of resistance.
Those things are more political,
more contentious than the other ones,
so we didn't know until the night before
whether it was going to come through.
We squeaked by.
The 16th out of 17 goals
commits to access to justice for all,
which is a big deal.
It's a big deal, yes.
Let's clap for justice.
(Applause)
Here's the scandal, though.
The day the goals were adopted,
most of them were accompanied
by big commitments:
a billion dollars
from the Gates Foundation
and the British government for nutrition;
25 billion in public-private financing
for health care for women and children.
On access to justice,
we had the words on the paper,
but nobody pledged a penny,
and so that is the opportunity
and the challenge that we face right now.
The world recognizes more than ever before
that you can't have
development without justice,
that people can't improve their lives
if they can't exercise their rights,
and what we need to do now
is turn that rhetoric,
turn that principle, into reality.
(Applause)
KK: How can we help?
What can people in this room do?
VM: Great question. Thank you for asking.
I would say three things.
One is invest.
If you have 10 dollars,
or a hundred dollars, a million dollars,
consider putting some of it
towards grassroots legal empowerment.
It's important in its own right
and it's crucial for just about
everything else we care about.
Number two,
push your politicians and your governments
to make this a public priority.
Just like health or education,
access to justice
should be one of the things
that a government owes its people,
and we're nowhere close to that,
neither in rich countries
or poor countries.
Number three is:
be a paralegal in your own life.
Find an injustice
or a problem where you live.
It's not hard to find, if you look.
Is the river being contaminated,
the one that passes through
the city where you live?
Are there workers getting paid
less than minimum wage
or who are working without safety gear?
Get to know the people most affected,
find out what the rules say,
see if you can use those rules
to get a solution.
If it doesn't work, see if you can
come together to improve those rules.
Because if we all start knowing law,
using law and shaping law,
then we will be building
that deeper version of democracy
that I believe our world
desperately needs.
(Applause)
KK: Thanks so much, Vivek.
VM: Thank you.
Today, I am going to talk about anger.

When I was 11,
seeing some of my friends 
leaving the school
because their parents 
could not afford textbooks
made me angry.
When I was 27,
hearing the plight
of a desperate slave father
whose daughter was 
about to be sold to a brothel
made me angry.
At the age of 50,
lying on the street,
in a pool of blood,
along with my own son,
made me angry.
Dear friends, for centuries
we were taught anger is bad.
Our parents, teachers, priests --
everyone taught us how to control 
and suppress our anger.
But I ask why?
Why can't we convert our anger
for the larger good of society?
Why can't we use our anger
to challenge and change
the evils of the world?
That I tried to do.
Friends,
most of the brightest ideas
came to my mind out of anger.
Like when I was 35 and sat 
in a locked-up, tiny prison.
The whole night, I was angry.
But it has given birth to a new idea.
But I will come to that later on.
Let me begin with the story
of how I got a name for myself.
I had been a big admirer 
of Mahatma Gandhi since my childhood.
Gandhi fought and lead 
India's freedom movement.
But more importantly,
he taught us how to treat 
the most vulnerable sections,
the most deprived people, 
with dignity and respect.
And so, when India was celebrating
Mahatma Gandhi's 
birth centenary in 1969 --
at that time I was 15 --
an idea came to my mind.
Why can't we celebrate it differently?
I knew, as perhaps
many of you might know,
that in India, a large number of people
are born in the lowest segment of caste.
And they are treated as untouchables.
These are the people --
forget about allowing them 
to go to the temples,
they cannot even go into the houses 
and shops of high-caste people.
So I was very impressed with 
the leaders of my town
who were speaking very highly against
the caste system and untouchability
and talking of Gandhian ideals.
So inspired by that, I thought,
let us set an example
by inviting these people to eat food
cooked and served
by the untouchable community.
I went to some low-caste,
so-called untouchable, people,
tried to convince them,
but it was unthinkable for them.
They told me, "No, no. It's not possible.
It never happened."
I said, "Look at these leaders,
they are so great, 
they are against untouchability.
They will come. If nobody comes, 
we can set an example."
These people thought that I was too naive.
Finally, they were convinced.
My friends and I took our bicycles
and invited political leaders.
And I was so thrilled, rather, empowered
to see that each one of them 
agreed to come.
I thought, "Great idea.
We can set an example.
We can bring about change in the society."
The day has come.
All these untouchables,
three women and two men,
they agreed to come.
I could recall that they had used 
the best of their clothes.
They brought new utensils.
They had taken baths 
hundreds of times
because it was unthinkable
for them to do.
It was the moment of change.
They gathered. Food was cooked.
It was 7 o'clock.
By 8 o'clock, we kept on waiting,
because it's not very uncommon 
that the leaders become late,
for an hour or so.
So after 8 o'clock, we took our bicycles
and went to these leaders' homes,
just to remind them.
One of the leader's wives told me,
"Sorry, he is having some headache,
perhaps he cannot come."
I went to another leader
and his wife told me, 
"Okay, you go, he will definitely join."
So I thought that the dinner
will take place,
though not at that large a scale.
I went back to the venue, which was
a newly built Mahatma Gandhi Park.
It was 10 o'clock.
None of the leaders showed up.
That made me angry.
I was standing, leaning against
Mahatma Gandhi's statue.
I was emotionally drained,
rather exhausted.
Then I sat down where 
the food was lying.
I kept my emotions on hold.
But then, when I took the first bite,
I broke down in tears.
And suddenly I felt a hand on my shoulder.
And it was the healing, motherly touch 
of an untouchable woman.
And she told me,
"Kailash, why are you crying?
You have done your bit.
You have eaten the food
cooked by untouchables,
which has never happened in our memory."
She said, "You won today."
And my friends, she was right.
I came back home, a little after midnight,
shocked to see that several 
high-caste elderly people
were sitting in my courtyard.
I saw my mother and 
elderly women were crying
and they were pleading 
to these elderly people
because they had threatened 
to outcaste my whole family.
And you know, outcasting the family
is the biggest social punishment
one can think of.
Somehow they agreed to punish only me,
and the punishment was purification.
That means I had to go 600 miles
away from my hometown
to the River Ganges to take a holy dip.
And after that, I should organize a feast
for priests, 101 priests,
wash their feet and drink that water.
It was total nonsense,
and I refused to accept that punishment.
How did they punish me?
I was barred from entering into my own 
kitchen and my own dining room,
my utensils were separated.
But the night when I was angry,
they wanted to outcaste me.
But I decided to outcaste 
the entire caste system.
(Applause)
And that was possible because
the beginning would have been
to change the family name, or surname,
because in India, most of
the family names are caste names.
So I decided to drop my name.
And then, later on, I gave 
a new name to myself: Satyarthi,
that means, "seeker of truth."
(Applause)
And that was the beginning 
of my transformative anger.
Friends, maybe one of you can tell me,
what was I doing before becoming
a children's rights activist?
Does anybody know?
No.
I was an engineer, an electrical engineer.
And then I learned how the energy
of burning fire, coal,
the nuclear blast inside the chambers,
raging river currents,
fierce winds,
could be converted into the light 
and lives of millions.
I also learned how the most
uncontrollable form of energy
could be harnessed for good 
and making society better.
So I'll come back to the story
of when I was caught in the prison:
I was very happy freeing 
a dozen children from slavery,
handing them over to their parents.
I cannot explain my joy 
when I free a child.
I was so happy.
But when I was waiting for my train
to come back to my hometown, Delhi,
I saw that dozens of children 
were arriving;
they were being trafficked by someone.
I stopped them, those people.
I complained to the police.
So the policemen, instead of helping me,
they threw me in this small, 
tiny shell, like an animal.
And that was the night of anger
when one of the brightest 
and biggest ideas was born.
I thought that if I keep on freeing 10 
children, and 50 more will join,
that's not done.
And I believed in the power of consumers,
and let me tell you that this
was the first time
when a campaign was launched by me
or anywhere in the world,
to educate and sensitize the consumers

to create a demand
for child-labor-free rugs.
In Europe and America, 
we have been successful.
And it has resulted 
in a fall in child labor
in South Asian countries by 80 percent.
(Applause)
Not only that, but this first-ever 
consumer's power, or consumer's campaign
has grown in other countries
and other industries,
maybe chocolate, maybe apparel, 
maybe shoes -- it has gone beyond.
My anger at the age of 11,
when I realized how important
education is for every child,
I got an idea to collect used books
and help the poorest children.
I created a book bank at the age of 11.
But I did not stop.
Later on, I cofounded
the world's single largest civil society
campaign for education
that is the Global Campaign for Education.
That has helped in changing 
the whole thinking towards education
from the charity mode
to the human rights mode,
and that has concretely helped 
the reduction of out-of-school children
by half in the last 15 years.
(Applause)
My anger at the age of 27,
to free that girl who was about
to be sold to a brothel,
has given me an idea
to go for a new strategy
of raid and rescue,
freeing children from slavery.
And I am so lucky and proud to say
that it is not one or 10 or 20,
but my colleagues and I have been able
to physically liberate 83,000 child slaves
and hand them over
back to their families and mothers.
(Applause)
I knew that we needed global policies.
We organized the worldwide marches
against child labor
and that has also resulted in 
a new international convention
to protect the children
who are in the worst forms.
And the concrete result was that
the number of child laborers globally
has gone down by one third 
in the last 15 years.
(Applause)
So, in each case,
it began from anger,
turned into an idea,
and action.
So anger, what next?
Idea, and --
Audience: Action
Kailash Satyarthi: Anger, idea, action.
Which I tried to do.
Anger is a power, anger is an energy,
and the law of nature is that energy
can never be created and never 
be vanished, can never be destroyed.
So why can't the energy of anger
be translated and harnessed
to create a better and beautiful world,
a more just and equitable world?
Anger is within each one of you,
and I will share a secret
for a few seconds:
that if we are confined in 
the narrow shells of egos,
and the circles of selfishness,
then the anger will turn out to be
hatred, violence, revenge, destruction.
But if we are able to break the circles,
then the same anger could turn 
into a great power.
We can break the circles 
by using our inherent compassion
and connect with the world through 
compassion to make this world better.
That same anger could be
transformed into it.
So dear friends, sisters and brothers,
again, as a Nobel Laureate,
I am urging you to become angry.
I am urging you to become angry.
And the angriest among us
is the one who can transform his anger 
into idea and action.
Thank you so much.
(Applause)
Chris Anderson: For many years, 
you've been an inspiration to others.
Who or what inspires you and why?
KS: Good question.
Chris, let me tell you, 
and that is the truth,
each time when I free a child,
the child who has lost all his hope
that he will ever come back to his mother,
the first smile of freedom,
and the mother who has lost all hope
that the son or daughter 
can ever come back and sit in her lap,
they become so emotional
and the first tear of joy 
rolls down on her cheek,
I see the glimpse of God in it --
this is my biggest inspiration.
And I am so lucky that not once,
as I said before, but thousands of times,
I have been able to witness my God
in the faces of those children
and they are my biggest inspirations.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Hi. I'm here to talk to you about the importance of
praise, admiration and thank you,
and having it be specific and genuine.
And the way I got interested in this was,
I noticed in myself, when I was growing up,
and until about a few years ago,
that I would want to say thank you to someone,
I would want to praise them,
I would want to take in their praise of me
and I'd just stop it.
And I asked myself, why?
I felt shy, I felt embarrassed.
And then my question became,
am I the only one who does this?
So, I decided to investigate.
I'm fortunate enough to work in the rehab facility,
so I get to see people who are facing life and death with addiction.
And sometimes it comes down to something as simple as,
their core wound is their father died without ever saying he's proud of them.
But then, they hear from all the family and friends
that the father told everybody else that he was proud of him,
but he never told the son.
It's because he didn't know that his son needed to hear it.
So my question is, why don't we ask for the things that we need?
I know a gentleman, married for 25 years,
who's longing to hear his wife say,
"Thank you for being the breadwinner, so I can stay home with the kids,"
but won't ask.
I know a woman who's good at this.
She, once a week, meets with her husband and says,
"I'd really like you to thank me for all these things I did in the house and with the kids."
And he goes, "Oh, this is great, this is great."
And praise really does have to be genuine,
but she takes responsibility for that.
And a friend of mine, April, who I've had since kindergarten,
she thanks her children for doing their chores.
And she said, "Why wouldn't I thank it, even though they're supposed to do it?"
So, the question is, why was I blocking it?
Why were other people blocking it?
Why can I say, "I'll take my steak medium rare,
I need size six shoes," but I won't say,
"Would you praise me this way?"
And it's because I'm giving you critical data about me.
I'm telling you where I'm insecure.
I'm telling you where I need your help.
And I'm treating you, my inner circle,
like you're the enemy.
Because what can you do with that data?
You could neglect me.
You could abuse it.
Or you could actually meet my need.
And I took my bike into the bike store-- I love this --
same bike, and they'd do something called "truing" the wheels.
The guy said, "You know, when you true the wheels,
it's going to make the bike so much better."
I get the same bike back,
and they've taken all the little warps out of those same wheels
I've had for two and a half years, and my bike is like new.
So, I'm going to challenge all of you.
I want you to true your wheels:
be honest about the praise that you need to hear.
What do you need to hear? Go home to your wife --
go ask her, what does she need?
Go home to your husband -- what does he need?
Go home and ask those questions, and then help the people around you.
And it's simple.
And why should we care about this?
We talk about world peace.
How can we have world peace with different cultures, different languages?
I think it starts household by household, under the same roof.
So, let's make it right in our own backyard.
And I want to thank all of you in the audience
for being great husbands, great mothers,
friends, daughters, sons.
And maybe somebody's never said that to you,
but you've done a really, really good job.
And thank you for being here, just showing up
and changing the world with your ideas.
Thank you.
(Applause)
I want to talk about
one of the big questions,
perhaps the biggest question:
How should we live together?
How should a group of people,
who perhaps live in a city
or in the continent
or even the whole globe,
share and manage common resources?
How should we make
the rules that govern us?
This has always been
an important question.
And today, I think
it's even more important than ever
if we want to address rising inequality,
climate change, the refugee crisis,
just to name a few major issues.
It's also a very old question.
Humans have been asking
themselves this question
ever since we lived
in organized societies.
Like this guy, Plato.
He thought we needed benevolent guardians
who could make decisions
for the greater good of everyone.
Kings and queens thought
they could be those guardians,
but during various revolutions,
they tended to lose their heads.
And this guy, you probably know.
Here in Hungary, you lived for many years
under one attempt to implement
his answer of how to live together.
His answer was brutal, cruel and inhumane.
But a different answer,
a different kind of answer,
which went more or less
into hibernation for 2,000 years,
has had profound recent success.
That answer is, of course, democracy.
If we take a quick look
at the modern history of democracy,
it goes something like this.
Along here, we're going
to put the last 200 years.
Up here, we're going to put
the number of democracies.
And the graph does this,
the important point of which,
is this extraordinary increase over time,
which is why the 20th century
has been called the century
of democracy's triumph,
and why, as Francis Fukuyama said in 1989,
some believe that we have reached
the end of history,
that the question of how to live together
has been answered,
and that answer is liberal democracy.
Let's explore that assertion, though.
I want to find out what you think.
So I'm going to ask you two questions,
and I want you to put your hands up
if you agree.
The first question is: Who thinks
living in a democracy is a good thing?
Who likes democracy?
If you can think of a better system,
keep your hands down.
Don't worry about those
who didn't raise their hands,
I'm sure they mean very well.
The second question is:
Who thinks our democracies
are functioning well?
Come on, there must be one politician
in the audience somewhere.
(Laughter)
No.
But my point is, if liberal democracy
is the end of history,
then there's a massive paradox
or contradiction here.
Why is that?
Well, the first question
is about the ideal of democracy,
and all these qualities
are very appealing.
But in practice, it's not working.
And that's the second question.
Our politics is broken,
our politicians aren't trusted,
and the political system is distorted
by powerful vested interests.
I think there's two ways
to resolve this paradox.
One is to give up on democracy;
it doesn't work.
Let's elect a populist demagogue
who will ignore democratic norms,
trample on liberal freedoms
and just get things done.
The other option, I think,
is to fix this broken system,
to bring the practice closer to the ideal
and put the diverse voices of society
in our parliaments
and get them to make considered,
evidence-based laws
for the long-term good of everyone.
Which brings me to my epiphany,
my moment of enlightenment.
And I want you to get critical.
I want you to ask yourselves,
"Why wouldn't this work?"
And then come and talk to me
afterwards about it.
Its technical name is "sortition."
But its common name is "random selection."
And the idea is actually very simple:
we randomly select people
and put them in parliament.
(Laughter)
Let's think about that
for a few more minutes, shall we?
Imagine we chose you and you
and you and you and you down there
and a bunch of other random people,
and we put you in our parliament
for the next couple of years.
Of course, we could stratify the selection
to make sure that it matched
the socioeconomic and demographic
profile of the country
and was a truly representative
sample of people.
Fifty percent of them would be women.
Many of them would be young,
some would be old,
a few would be rich,
but most of them would be
ordinary people like you and me.
This would be a microcosm of society.
And this microcosm would simulate
how we would all think,
if we had the time, the information
and a good process to come to
the moral crux of political decisions.
And although you may not be in that group,
someone of your age,
someone of your gender,
someone from your location
and someone with your background
would be in that room.
The decisions made by these people
would build on the wisdom of crowds.
They would become more
than the sum of their parts.
They would become critical thinkers
with access to experts,
who would be on tap but not on top.
And they could prove
that diversity can trump ability
when confronting the wide array
of societal questions and problems.
It would not be government
by public opinion poll.
It would not be government by referendum.
These informed, deliberating people
would move beyond public opinion
to the making of public judgments.
However, there would be
one major side effect:
if we replaced elections with sortition
and made our parliament
truly representative of society,
it would mean the end of politicians.
And I'm sure we'd all be
pretty sad to see that.
(Laughter)
Very interestingly,
random selection was a key part
of how democracy was done
in ancient Athens.
This machine, this device,
is called a kleroteria.
It's an ancient Athenian
random-selection device.
The ancient Athenians
randomly selected citizens
to fill the vast majority
of their political posts.
They knew that elections
were aristocratic devices.
They knew that career politicians
were a thing to be avoided.
And I think we know these things as well.
But more interesting than
the ancient use of random selection
is its modern resurgence.
The rediscovery of the legitimacy
of random selection in politics
has become so common lately,
that there's simply
too many examples to talk about.
Of course, I'm very aware
that it's going to be difficult
to institute this in our parliaments.
Try this -- say to your friend,
"I think we should populate our parliament
with randomly selected people."
"Are you joking?
What if my neighbor gets chosen?
The fool can't even
separate his recycling."
But the perhaps surprising
but overwhelming and compelling evidence
from all these modern examples
is that it does work.
If you give people responsibility,
they act responsibly.
Don't get me wrong -- it's not a panacea.
The question is not:
Would this be perfect?
Of course not.
People are fallibly human,
and distorting influences
will continue to exist.
The question is: Would it be better?
And the answer to that question,
to me at least, is obviously yes.
Which gets us back
to our original question:
How should we live together?
And now we have an answer:
with a parliament that uses sortition.
But how would we get from here to there?
How could we fix our broken system
and remake democracy for the 21st century?
Well, there are several
things that we can do,
and that are, in fact,
happening right now.
We can experiment with sortition.
We can introduce it to schools
and workplaces and other institutions,
like Democracy In Practice
is doing in Bolivia.
We can hold policy juries
and citizens' assemblies,
like the newDemocracy Foundation
is doing in Australia,
like the Jefferson Center
is doing in the US
and like the Irish government
is doing right now.
We could build a social movement
demanding change,
which is what the Sortition Foundation
is doing in the UK.
And at some point, we should institute it.
Perhaps the first step would be
a second chamber in our parliament,
full of randomly selected people --
a citizens' senate, if you will.
There's a campaign
for a citizens' senate in France
and another campaign in Scotland,
and it could, of course, be done
right here in Hungary.
That would be kind of like a Trojan horse
right into the heart of government.
And then, when it becomes impossible
to patch over the cracks
in the current system,
we must step up and replace
elections with sortition.
I have hope.
Here in Hungary,
systems have been created,
and systems have been
torn down and replaced
in the past.
Change can and does happen.
It's just a matter of when and how.
Thank you.
(Hungarian) Thank you.
(Applause)
When I turned 19, I started my career
as the first female photojournalist
in the Gaza Strip, Palestine.
My work as a woman photographer
was considered a serious insult
to local traditions,
and created a lasting stigma
for me and my family.
The male-dominated field made my presence
unwelcome by all possible means.
They made clear that a woman
must not do a man's job.
Photo agencies in Gaza refused to train me
because of my gender.
The "No" sign was pretty clear.
Three of my colleagues
went as far as to drive me to an open air strike area
where the explosion sounds
were the only thing I could hear.
Dust was flying in the air,
and the ground was shaking like a swing beneath me.
I only realized we weren't
there to document the event
when the three of them got back into the armored Jeep
and drove away, waving and laughing,
leaving me behind in the open air strike zone.
For a moment, I felt terrified,
humiliated, and sorry for myself.
My colleagues' action was not
the only death threat I have received,
but it was the most dangerous one.
The perception of women's life in Gaza
is passive.
Until a recent time, a lot of 
women were not allowed
to work or pursue education.
At times of such doubled war including
both social restrictions on women
and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict,
women's dark and bright stories were fading away.
To men, women's stories were seen
as inconsequential.
I started paying closer attention
to women's lives in Gaza.
Because of my gender, I had access
to worlds where my colleagues were forbidden.
Beyond the obvious pain and struggle,
there was a healthy dose
of laughter and accomplishments.
In front of a police compound in Gaza City
during the first war in Gaza,
an Israeli air raid managed to destroy the compound
and break my nose.
For a moment, all I saw was white, bright white,
like these lights.
I thought to myself I either got blind
or I was in heaven.
By the time I managed to open my eyes,
I had documented this moment.
Mohammed Khader, a Palestinian worker
who spent two decades in Israel,
as his retirement plan,
he decided to build a four-floor house,
only by the first field operation at his neighborhood,
the house was flattened to the ground.
Nothing was left but the pigeons he raised
and a jacuzzi, a bathtub
that he got from Tel Aviv.
Mohammed got the bathtub
on the top of the rubble
and started giving his kids
an every morning bubble bath.
My work is not meant to hide the scars of war,
but to show the full frame
of unseen stories of Gazans.
As a Palestinian female photographer,
the journey of struggle, survival and everyday life
has inspired me to overcome the community taboo
and see a different side of war and its aftermath.
I became a witness with a choice:
to run away or stand still.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Many believe driving is an activity
solely reserved for those who can see.
A blind person driving a vehicle safely and independently
was thought to be an impossible task, until now.
Hello, my name is Dennis Hong,
and we're bringing freedom and independence to the blind
by building a vehicle for the visually impaired.
So before I talk about this car for the blind,
let me briefly tell you about another project that I worked on
called the DARPA Urban Challenge.
Now this was about building a robotic car
that can drive itself.
You press start, nobody touches anything,
and it can reach its destination fully autonomously.
So in 2007, our team won half a million dollars
by placing third place in this competition.
So about that time,
the National Federation of the Blind, or NFB,
challenged the research committee
about who can develop a car
that lets a blind person drive safely and independently.
We decided to give it a try,
because we thought, "Hey, how hard could it be?"
We have already an autonomous vehicle.
We just put a blind person in it and we're done, right?
(Laughter)
We couldn't have been more wrong.
What NFB wanted
was not a vehicle that can drive a blind person around,
but a vehicle where a blind person can make active decisions and drive.
So we had to throw everything out the window
and start from scratch.
So to test this crazy idea,
we developed a small dune buggy prototype vehicle
to test the feasibility.
And in the summer of 2009,
we invited dozens of blind youth from all over the country
and gave them a chance to take it for a spin.
It was an absolutely amazing experience.
But the problem with this car was
it was designed to only be driven in a very controlled environment,
in a flat, closed-off parking lot --
even the lanes defined by red traffic cones.
So with this success,
we decided to take the next big step,
to develop a real car that can be driven on real roads.
So how does it work?
Well, it's a rather complex system,
but let me try to explain it, maybe simplify it.
So we have three steps.
We have perception, computation
and non-visual interfaces.
Now obviously the driver cannot see,
so the system needs to perceive the environment
and gather information for the driver.
For that, we use an initial measurement unit.
So it measures acceleration, angular acceleration --
like a human ear, inner ear.
We fuse that information with a GPS unit
to get an estimate of the location of the car.
We also use two cameras to detect the lanes of the road.
And we also use three laser range finders.
The lasers scan the environment to detect obstacles --
a car approaching from the front, the back
and also any obstacles that run into the roads,
any obstacles around the vehicle.
So all this vast amount of information is then fed into the computer,
and the computer can do two things.
One is, first of all, process this information
to have an understanding of the environment --
these are the lanes of the road, there's the obstacles --
and convey this information to the driver.
The system is also smart enough
to figure out the safest way to operate the car.
So we can also generate instructions
on how to operate the controls of the vehicle.
But the problem is this: How do we convey
this information and instructions
to a person who cannot see
fast enough and accurate enough so he can drive?
So for this, we developed many different types
of non-visual user interface technology.
So starting from a three-dimensional ping sound system,
a vibrating vest,
a click wheel with voice commands, a leg strip,
even a shoe that applies pressure to the foot.
But today we're going to talk about
three of these non-visual user interfaces.
Now the first interface is called a DriveGrip.
So these are a pair of gloves,
and it has vibrating elements on the knuckle part
so you can convey instructions about how to steer --
the direction and the intensity.
Another device is called SpeedStrip.
So this is a chair -- as a matter of fact, it's actually a massage chair.
We gut it out, and we rearrange the vibrating elements in different patterns,
and we actuate them to convey information about the speed,
and also instructions how to use the gas and the brake pedal.
So over here, you can see
how the computer understands the environment,
and because you cannot see the vibration,
we actually put red LED's on the driver so that you can see what's happening.
This is the sensory data,
and that data is transferred to the devices through the computer.
So these two devices, DriveGrip and SpeedStrip,
are very effective.
But the problem is
these are instructional cue devices.
So this is not really freedom, right?
The computer tells you how to drive --
turn left, turn right, speed up, stop.
We call this the "backseat-driver problem."
So we're moving away from the instructional cue devices,
and we're now focusing more
on the informational devices.
A good example for this informational non-visual user interface
is called AirPix.
So think of it as a monitor for the blind.
So it's a small tablet, has many holes in it,
and compressed air comes out,
so it can actually draw images.
So even though you are blind, you can put your hand over it,
you can see the lanes of the road and obstacles.
Actually, you can also change the frequency of the air coming out
and possibly the temperature.
So it's actually a multi-dimensional user interface.
So here you can see the left camera, the right camera from the vehicle
and how the computer interprets that and sends that information to the AirPix.
For this, we're showing a simulator,
a blind person driving using the AirPix.
This simulator was also very useful for training the blind drivers
and also quickly testing different types of ideas
for different types of non-visual user interfaces.
So basically that's how it works.
So just a month ago,
on January 29th,
we unveiled this vehicle for the very first time to the public
at the world-famous Daytona International Speedway
during the Rolex 24 racing event.
We also had some surprises. Let's take a look.
(Music)
(Video) Announcer: This is an historic day in January.
He's coming up to the grandstand, fellow Federationists.
(Cheering)
(Honking)
There's the grandstand now.
And he's [unclear] following that van that's out in front of him.
Well there comes the first box.
Now let's see if Mark avoids it.
He does. He passes it on the right.
Third box is out. The fourth box is out.
And he's perfectly making his way between the two.
He's closing in on the van
to make the moving pass.
Well this is what it's all about,
this kind of dynamic display of audacity and ingenuity.
He's approaching the end of the run,
makes his way between the barrels that are set up there.
(Honking)
(Applause)
Dennis Hong: I'm so happy for you.
Mark's going to give me a ride back to the hotel.
Mark Riccobono: Yes.
(Applause)
DH: So since we started this project,
we've been getting hundreds of letters, emails, phone calls
from people from all around the world.
Letters thanking us, but sometimes you also get funny letters like this one:
"Now I understand why there is Braille on a drive-up ATM machine."
(Laughter)
But sometimes --
(Laughter)
But sometimes I also do get --
I wouldn't call it hate mail --
but letters of really strong concern:
"Dr. Hong, are you insane,
trying to put blind people on the road?
You must be out of your mind."
But this vehicle is a prototype vehicle,
and it's not going to be on the road
until it's proven as safe as, or safer than, today's vehicle.
And I truly believe that this can happen.
But still, will the society,
would they accept such a radical idea?
How are we going to handle insurance?
How are we going to issue driver's licenses?
There's many of these different kinds of hurdles besides technology challenges
that we need to address before this becomes a reality.
Of course, the main goal of this project
is to develop a car for the blind.
But potentially more important than this
is the tremendous value of the spin-off technology
that can come from this project.
The sensors that are used can see through the dark,
the fog and rain.
And together with this new type of interfaces,
we can use these technologies
and apply them to safer cars for sighted people.
Or for the blind, everyday home appliances --
in the educational setting, in the office setting.
Just imagine, in a classroom a teacher writes on the blackboard
and a blind student can see what's written and read
using these non-visual interfaces.
This is priceless.
So today, the things I've showed you today, is just the beginning.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
It is a dream of mankind
to fly like a bird.
Birds are very agile.
They fly, not with rotating components,
so they fly only by flapping their wings.
So we looked at the birds,
and we tried to make a model
that is powerful, ultralight,
and it must have excellent
aerodynamic qualities
that would fly by its own
and only by flapping its wings.
So what would be better than to use
the herring gull, in its freedom,
circling and swooping over the sea,
and to use this as a role model?
So we bring a team together.
There are generalists and also specialists
in the field of aerodynamics,
in the field of building gliders.
And the task was to build
an ultralight indoor-flying model
that is able to fly over your heads.
So be careful later on.
(Laughter)
And this was one issue:
to build it that lightweight
that no one would be hurt if it fell down.
So why do we do all this?
We are a company
in the field of automation,
and we'd like to do
very lightweight structures
because that's energy efficient,
and we'd like to learn more
about pneumatics and air flow phenomena.
So I now would like you
to put your seat belts on
and put your hats on.
So maybe we'll try it once --
to fly a SmartBird.
Thank you.
(Applause)
(Cheers)
(Applause)
(Applause ends)
(Applause)
So we can now look at the SmartBird.
So here is one without a skin.
We have a wingspan of about two meters.
The length is one meter and six,
and the weight is only 450 grams.
And it is all out of carbon fiber.
In the middle we have a motor,
and we also have a gear in it,
and we use the gear
to transfer the circulation of the motor.
So within the motor,
we have three Hall sensors,
so we know exactly where the wing is.
And if we now beat up and down --
(Mechanical sounds)
We have the possibility
to fly like a bird.
So if you go down, you have
the large area of propulsion,
and if you go up,
the wings are not that large,
and it is easier to get up.
So, the next thing we did,
or the challenges we did,
was to coordinate this movement.
We have to turn it, go up and go down.
We have a split wing.
With the split wing,
we get the lift at the upper wing,
and we get the propulsion
at the lower wing.
Also, we see how we measure
the aerodynamic efficiency.
We had knowledge
about the electromechanical efficiency
and then we can calculate
the aerodynamic efficiency.
So therefore, it rises up
from passive torsion to active torsion,
from 30 percent up to 80 percent.
Next thing we have to do,
we have to control and regulate
the whole structure.
Only if you control and regulate it,
you will get that aerodynamic efficiency.
So the overall consumption of energy
is about 25 watts at takeoff
and 16 to 18 watts in flight.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Bruno Giussani: Markus,
we should fly it once more.
Markus Fischer: Yeah, sure.
(Audience) Yeah!
(Laughter)
(Gasps)
(Cheers)
(Applause)
I work on helping computers
communicate about the world around us.
There are a lot of ways to do this,
and I like to focus on helping computers
to talk about what they see
and understand.
Given a scene like this,
a modern computer-vision algorithm
can tell you that there's a woman
and there's a dog.
It can tell you that the woman is smiling.
It might even be able to tell you
that the dog is incredibly cute.
I work on this problem
thinking about how humans
understand and process the world.
The thoughts, memories and stories
that a scene like this
might evoke for humans.
All the interconnections
of related situations.
Maybe you've seen
a dog like this one before,
or you've spent time
running on a beach like this one,
and that further evokes thoughts
and memories of a past vacation,
past times to the beach,
times spent running around
with other dogs.
One of my guiding principles
is that by helping computers to understand
what it's like to have these experiences,
to understand what we share
and believe and feel,
then we're in a great position
to start evolving computer technology
in a way that's complementary
with our own experiences.
So, digging more deeply into this,
a few years ago I began working on helping
computers to generate human-like stories
from sequences of images.
So, one day,
I was working with my computer to ask it
what it thought about a trip to Australia.
It took a look at the pictures,
and it saw a koala.
It didn't know what the koala was,
but it said it thought
it was an interesting-looking creature.
Then I shared with it a sequence of images
about a house burning down.
It took a look at the images and it said,
"This is an amazing view!
This is spectacular!"
It sent chills down my spine.
It saw a horrible, life-changing
and life-destroying event
and thought it was something positive.
I realized that it recognized
the contrast,
the reds, the yellows,
and thought it was something
worth remarking on positively.
And part of why it was doing this
was because most
of the images I had given it
were positive images.
That's because people
tend to share positive images
when they talk about their experiences.
When was the last time
you saw a selfie at a funeral?
I realized that,
as I worked on improving AI
task by task, dataset by dataset,
that I was creating massive gaps,
holes and blind spots
in what it could understand.
And while doing so,
I was encoding all kinds of biases.
Biases that reflect a limited viewpoint,
limited to a single dataset --
biases that can reflect
human biases found in the data,
such as prejudice and stereotyping.
I thought back to the evolution
of the technology
that brought me to where I was that day --
how the first color images
were calibrated against
a white woman's skin,
meaning that color photography
was biased against black faces.
And that same bias, that same blind spot
continued well into the '90s.
And the same blind spot
continues even today
in how well we can recognize
different people's faces
in facial recognition technology.
I though about the state of the art
in research today,
where we tend to limit our thinking
to one dataset and one problem.
And that in doing so, we were creating
more blind spots and biases
that the AI could further amplify.
I realized then
that we had to think deeply
about how the technology we work on today
looks in five years, in 10 years.
Humans evolve slowly,
with time to correct for issues
in the interaction of humans
and their environment.
In contrast, artificial intelligence
is evolving at an incredibly fast rate.
And that means that it really matters
that we think about this
carefully right now --
that we reflect on our own blind spots,
our own biases,
and think about how that's informing
the technology we're creating
and discuss what the technology of today
will mean for tomorrow.
CEOs and scientists have weighed in
on what they think
the artificial intelligence technology
of the future will be.
Stephen Hawking warns that
"Artificial intelligence
could end mankind."
Elon Musk warns
that it's an existential risk
and one of the greatest risks
that we face as a civilization.
Bill Gates has made the point,
"I don't understand
why people aren't more concerned."
But these views --
they're part of the story.
The math, the models,
the basic building blocks
of artificial intelligence
are something that we call access
and all work with.
We have open-source tools
for machine learning and intelligence
that we can contribute to.
And beyond that,
we can share our experience.
We can share our experiences
with technology and how it concerns us
and how it excites us.
We can discuss what we love.
We can communicate with foresight
about the aspects of technology
that could be more beneficial
or could be more problematic over time.
If we all focus on opening up
the discussion on AI
with foresight towards the future,
this will help create a general
conversation and awareness
about what AI is now,
what it can become
and all the things that we need to do
in order to enable that outcome
that best suits us.
We already see and know this
in the technology that we use today.
We use smart phones
and digital assistants and Roombas.
Are they evil?
Maybe sometimes.
Are they beneficial?
Yes, they're that, too.
And they're not all the same.
And there you already see
a light shining on what the future holds.
The future continues on
from what we build and create right now.
We set into motion that domino effect
that carves out AI's evolutionary path.
In our time right now,
we shape the AI of tomorrow.
Technology that immerses us
in augmented realities
bringing to life past worlds.
Technology that helps people
to share their experiences
when they have difficulty communicating.
Technology built on understanding
the streaming visual worlds
used as technology for self-driving cars.
Technology built on understanding images
and generating language,
evolving into technology that helps people
who are visually impaired
be better able to access the visual world.
And we also see how technology
can lead to problems.
We have technology today
that analyzes physical
characteristics we're born with --
such as the color of our skin
or the look of our face --
in order to determine whether or not
we might be criminals or terrorists.
We have technology
that crunches through our data,
even data relating
to our gender or our race,
in order to determine whether or not
we might get a loan.
All that we see now
is a snapshot in the evolution
of artificial intelligence.
Because where we are right now,
is within a moment of that evolution.
That means that what we do now
will affect what happens down the line
and in the future.
If we want AI to evolve
in a way that helps humans,
then we need to define
the goals and strategies
that enable that path now.
What I'd like to see is something
that fits well with humans,
with our culture and with the environment.
Technology that aids and assists
those of us with neurological conditions
or other disabilities
in order to make life
equally challenging for everyone.
Technology that works
regardless of your demographics
or the color of your skin.
And so today, what I focus on
is the technology for tomorrow
and for 10 years from now.
AI can turn out in many different ways.
But in this case,
it isn't a self-driving car
without any destination.
This is the car that we are driving.
We choose when to speed up
and when to slow down.
We choose if we need to make a turn.
We choose what the AI
of the future will be.
There's a vast playing field
of all the things that artificial
intelligence can become.
It will become many things.
And it's up to us now,
in order to figure out
what we need to put in place
to make sure the outcomes
of artificial intelligence
are the ones that will be
better for all of us.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Whether you like it or not,
radical transparency and algorithmic
decision-making is coming at you fast,
and it's going to change your life.
That's because it's now easy
to take algorithms
and embed them into computers
and gather all that data
that you're leaving on yourself
all over the place,
and know what you're like,
and then direct the computers
to interact with you
in ways that are better
than most people can.
Well, that might sound scary.
I've been doing this for a long time
and I have found it to be wonderful.
My objective has been
to have meaningful work
and meaningful relationships
with the people I work with,
and I've learned that I couldn't have that
unless I had that radical transparency
and that algorithmic decision-making.
I want to show you why that is,
I want to show you how it works.
And I warn you that some of the things
that I'm going to show you
probably are a little bit shocking.
Since I was a kid,
I've had a terrible rote memory.
And I didn't like following instructions,
I was no good at following instructions.
But I loved to figure out
how things worked for myself.
When I was 12,
I hated school but I fell in love
with trading the markets.
I caddied at the time,
earned about five dollars a bag.
And I took my caddying money,
and I put it in the stock market.
And that was just because
the stock market was hot at the time.
And the first company I bought
was a company by the name
of Northeast Airlines.
Northeast Airlines was
the only company I heard of
that was selling for less
than five dollars a share.
(Laughter)
And I figured I could buy more shares,
and if it went up, I'd make more money.
So, it was a dumb strategy, right?
But I tripled my money,
and I tripled my money
because I got lucky.
The company was about to go bankrupt,
but some other company acquired it,
and I tripled my money.
And I was hooked.
And I thought, "This game is easy."
With time,
I learned this game is anything but easy.
In order to be an effective investor,
one has to bet against the consensus
and be right.
And it's not easy to bet
against the consensus and be right.
One has to bet against
the consensus and be right
because the consensus
is built into the price.
And in order to be an entrepreneur,
a successful entrepreneur,
one has to bet against
the consensus and be right.
I had to be an entrepreneur
and an investor --
and what goes along with that
is making a lot of painful mistakes.
So I made a lot of painful mistakes,
and with time,
my attitude about those mistakes
began to change.
I began to think of them as puzzles.
That if I could solve the puzzles,
they would give me gems.
And the puzzles were:
What would I do differently in the future
so I wouldn't make that painful mistake?
And the gems were principles
that I would then write down
so I would remember them
that would help me in the future.
And because I wrote them down so clearly,
I could then --
eventually discovered --
I could then embed them into algorithms.
And those algorithms
would be embedded in computers,
and the computers would
make decisions along with me;
and so in parallel,
we would make these decisions.
And I could see how those decisions
then compared with my own decisions,
and I could see that
those decisions were a lot better.
And that was because the computer
could make decisions much faster,
it could process a lot more information
and it can process decisions much more --
less emotionally.
So it radically improved
my decision-making.
Eight years after I started Bridgewater,
I had my greatest failure,
my greatest mistake.
It was late 1970s,
I was 34 years old,
and I had calculated that American banks
had lent much more money
to emerging countries
than those countries
were going to be able to pay back
and that we would have
the greatest debt crisis
since the Great Depression.
And with it, an economic crisis
and a big bear market in stocks.
It was a controversial view at the time.
People thought it was
kind of a crazy point of view.
But in August 1982,
Mexico defaulted on its debt,
and a number of other countries followed.
And we had the greatest debt crisis
since the Great Depression.
And because I had anticipated that,
I was asked to testify to Congress
and appear on "Wall Street Week,"
which was the show of the time.
Just to give you a flavor of that,
I've got a clip here,
and you'll see me in there.
(Video) Mr. Chairman, Mr. Mitchell,
it's a great pleasure and a great honor
to be able to appear before you
in examination with what
is going wrong with our economy.
The economy is now flat --
teetering on the brink of failure.
Martin Zweig: You were recently
quoted in an article.
You said, "I can say this
with absolute certainty
because I know how markets work."
Ray Dalio: I can say
with absolute certainty
that if you look at the liquidity base
in the corporations
and the world as a whole,
that there's such reduced
level of liquidity
that you can't return
to an era of stagflation."
I look at that now, I think,
"What an arrogant jerk!"
(Laughter)
I was so arrogant, and I was so wrong.
I mean, while the debt crisis happened,
the stock market and the economy
went up rather than going down,
and I lost so much money
for myself and for my clients
that I had to shut down
my operation pretty much,
I had to let almost everybody go.
And these were like extended family,
I was heartbroken.
And I had lost so much money
that I had to borrow
4,000 dollars from my dad
to help to pay my family bills.
It was one of the most painful
experiences of my life ...
but it turned out to be
one of the greatest experiences of my life
because it changed my attitude
about decision-making.
Rather than thinking, "I'm right,"
I started to ask myself,
"How do I know I'm right?"
I gained a humility that I needed
in order to balance my audacity.
I wanted to find the smartest
people who would disagree with me
to try to understand their perspective
or to have them
stress test my perspective.
I wanted to make an idea meritocracy.
In other words,
not an autocracy in which
I would lead and others would follow
and not a democracy in which everybody's
points of view were equally valued,
but I wanted to have an idea meritocracy
in which the best ideas would win out.
And in order to do that,
I realized that we would need
radical truthfulness
and radical transparency.
What I mean by radical truthfulness
and radical transparency
is people needed to say
what they really believed
and to see everything.
And we literally
tape almost all conversations
and let everybody see everything,
because if we didn't do that,
we couldn't really have
an idea meritocracy.
In order to have an idea meritocracy,
we have let people speak
and say what they want.
Just to give you an example,
this is an email from Jim Haskel --
somebody who works for me --
and this was available
to everybody in the company.
"Ray, you deserve a 'D-'
for your performance
today in the meeting ...
you did not prepare at all well
because there is no way
you could have been that disorganized."
Isn't that great?
(Laughter)
That's great.
It's great because, first of all,
I needed feedback like that.
I need feedback like that.
And it's great because if I don't let Jim,
and people like Jim,
to express their points of view,
our relationship wouldn't be the same.
And if I didn't make that public
for everybody to see,
we wouldn't have an idea meritocracy.
So for that last 25 years
that's how we've been operating.
We've been operating
with this radical transparency
and then collecting these principles,
largely from making mistakes,
and then embedding
those principles into algorithms.
And then those algorithms provide --
we're following the algorithms
in parallel with our thinking.
That has been how we've run
the investment business,
and it's how we also deal
with the people management.
In order to give you a glimmer
into what this looks like,
I'd like to take you into a meeting
and introduce you to a tool of ours
called the "Dot Collector"
that helps us do this.
A week after the US election,
our research team held a meeting
to discuss what a Trump presidency
would mean for the US economy.
Naturally, people had
different opinions on the matter
and how we were
approaching the discussion.
The "Dot Collector" collects these views.
It has a list of a few dozen attributes,
so whenever somebody thinks something
about another person's thinking,
it's easy for them
to convey their assessment;
they simply note the attribute
and provide a rating from one to 10.
For example, as the meeting began,
a researcher named Jen rated me a three --
in other words, badly --
(Laughter)
for not showing a good balance
of open-mindedness and assertiveness.
As the meeting transpired,
Jen's assessments of people
added up like this.
Others in the room
have different opinions.
That's normal.
Different people are always
going to have different opinions.
And who knows who's right?
Let's look at just what people thought
about how I was doing.
Some people thought I did well,
others, poorly.
With each of these views,
we can explore the thinking
behind the numbers.
Here's what Jen and Larry said.
Note that everyone
gets to express their thinking,
including their critical thinking,
regardless of their position
in the company.
Jen, who's 24 years old
and right out of college,
can tell me, the CEO,
that I'm approaching things terribly.
This tool helps people
both express their opinions
and then separate themselves
from their opinions
to see things from a higher level.
When Jen and others shift their attentions
from inputting their own opinions
to looking down on the whole screen,
their perspective changes.
They see their own opinions
as just one of many
and naturally start asking themselves,
"How do I know my opinion is right?"
That shift in perspective is like going
from seeing in one dimension
to seeing in multiple dimensions.
And it shifts the conversation
from arguing over our opinions
to figuring out objective criteria
for determining which opinions are best.
Behind the "Dot Collector"
is a computer that is watching.
It watches what all
these people are thinking
and it correlates that
with how they think.
And it communicates advice
back to each of them based on that.
Then it draws the data
from all the meetings
to create a pointilist painting
of what people are like
and how they think.
And it does that guided by algorithms.
Knowing what people are like helps
to match them better with their jobs.
For example,
a creative thinker who is unreliable
might be matched up with someone
who's reliable but not creative.
Knowing what people are like
also allows us to decide
what responsibilities to give them
and to weigh our decisions
based on people's merits.
We call it their believability.
Here's an example of a vote that we took
where the majority
of people felt one way ...
but when we weighed the views
based on people's merits,
the answer was completely different.
This process allows us to make decisions
not based on democracy,
not based on autocracy,
but based on algorithms that take
people's believability into consideration.
Yup, we really do this.
(Laughter)
We do it because it eliminates
what I believe to be
one of the greatest tragedies of mankind,
and that is people arrogantly,
naïvely holding opinions
in their minds that are wrong,
and acting on them,
and not putting them out there
to stress test them.
And that's a tragedy.
And we do it because it elevates ourselves
above our own opinions
so that we start to see things
through everybody's eyes,
and we see things collectively.
Collective decision-making is so much
better than individual decision-making
if it's done well.
It's been the secret sauce
behind our success.
It's why we've made
more money for our clients
than any other hedge fund in existence
and made money
23 out of the last 26 years.
So what's the problem
with being radically truthful
and radically transparent with each other?
People say it's emotionally difficult.
Critics say it's a formula
for a brutal work environment.
Neuroscientists tell me it has to do
with how are brains are prewired.
There's a part of our brain
that would like to know our mistakes
and like to look at our weaknesses
so we could do better.
I'm told that that's
the prefrontal cortex.
And then there's a part of our brain
which views all of this as attacks.
I'm told that that's the amygdala.
In other words,
there are two you's inside you:
there's an emotional you
and there's an intellectual you,
and often they're at odds,
and often they work against you.
It's been our experience
that we can win this battle.
We win it as a group.
It takes about 18 months typically
to find that most people
prefer operating this way,
with this radical transparency
than to be operating
in a more opaque environment.
There's not politics,
there's not the brutality of --
you know, all of that hidden,
behind-the-scenes --
there's an idea meritocracy
where people can speak up.
And that's been great.
It's given us more effective work,
and it's given us
more effective relationships.
But it's not for everybody.
We found something like
25 or 30 percent of the population
it's just not for.
And by the way,
when I say radical transparency,
I'm not saying transparency
about everything.
I mean, you don't have to tell somebody
that their bald spot is growing
or their baby's ugly.
So, I'm just talking about --
(Laughter)
talking about the important things.
So --
(Laughter)
So when you leave this room,
I'd like you to observe yourself
in conversations with others.
Imagine if you knew
what they were really thinking,
and imagine if you knew
what they were really like ...
and imagine if they knew
what you were really thinking
and what were really like.
It would certainly clear things up a lot
and make your operations
together more effective.
I think it will improve
your relationships.
Now imagine that you can have algorithms
that will help you gather
all of that information
and even help you make decisions
in an idea-meritocratic way.
This sort of radical transparency
is coming at you
and it is going to affect your life.
And in my opinion,
it's going to be wonderful.
So I hope it is as wonderful for you
as it is for me.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
As an actor, I get scripts
and it's my job to stay on script,
to say my lines
and bring to life a character
that someone else wrote.
Over the course of my career,
I've had the great honor
playing some of the greatest
male role models ever
represented on television.
You might recognize me
as "Male Escort #1."
(Laughter)
"Photographer Date Rapist,"
"Shirtless Date Rapist"
from the award-winning
"Spring Break Shark Attack."
(Laughter)
"Shirtless Medical Student,"
"Shirtless Steroid-Using Con Man"
and, in my most
well-known role, as Rafael.
(Applause)
A brooding, reformed playboy
who falls for, of all things, a virgin,
and who is only occasionally shirtless.
(Laughter)
Now, these roles don't represent
the kind of man I am in my real life,
but that's what I love about acting.
I get to live inside characters
very different than myself.
But every time I got
one of these roles, I was surprised,
because most of the men
I play ooze machismo,
charisma and power,
and when I look in the mirror,
that's just not how I see myself.
But it was how Hollywood saw me,
and over time, I noticed a parallel
between the roles I would play as a man
both on-screen and off.
I've been pretending to be
a man that I'm not my entire life.
I've been pretending
to be strong when I felt weak,
confident when I felt insecure
and tough when really I was hurting.
I think for the most part
I've just been kind of putting on a show,
but I'm tired of performing.
And I can tell you right now
that it is exhausting trying to be
man enough for everyone all the time.
Now -- right?
(Laughter)
My brother heard that.
Now, for as long
as I can remember, I've been told
the kind of man
that I should grow up to be.
As a boy, all I wanted was to be
accepted and liked by the other boys,
but that acceptance meant I had to acquire
this almost disgusted view
of the feminine,
and since we were told that feminine
is the opposite of masculine,
I either had to reject
embodying any of these qualities
or face rejection myself.
This is the script that we've been given.
Right? Girls are weak,
and boys are strong.
This is what's being
subconsciously communicated
to hundreds of millions of young boys
and girls all over the world,
just like it was with me.
Well, I came here today to say, as a man
that this is wrong, this is toxic,
and it has to end.
(Applause)
Now, I'm not here
to give a history lesson.
We likely all know how we got here, OK?
But I'm just a guy that woke up
after 30 years and realized
that I was living in a state of conflict,
conflict with who I feel I am in my core
and conflict with who the world
tells me as a man I should be.
But I don't have a desire
to fit into the current
broken definition of masculinity,
because I don't just want
to be a good man.
I want to be a good human.
And I believe the only way that can happen
is if men learn to not only
embrace the qualities
that we were told
are feminine in ourselves
but to be willing to stand up,
to champion and learn
from the women who embody them.
Now, men --
(Laughter)
I am not saying that everything
we have learned is toxic. OK?
I'm not saying there's anything
inherently wrong with you or me,
and men, I'm not saying
we have to stop being men.
But we need balance, right?
We need balance,
and the only way things will change
is if we take a real honest look
at the scripts that have been
passed down to us
from generation to generation
and the roles that,
as men, we choose to take on
in our everyday lives.
So speaking of scripts,
the first script I ever got
came from my dad.
My dad is awesome.
He's loving, he's kind,
he's sensitive, he's nurturing,
he's here.
(Applause)
He's crying.
(Laughter)
But, sorry, Dad,
as a kid I resented him for it,
because I blamed him for making me soft,
which wasn't welcomed
in the small town in Oregon
that we had moved to.
Because being soft
meant that I was bullied.
See, my dad wasn't
traditionally masculine,
so he didn't teach me how to use my hands.
He didn't teach me
how to hunt, how to fight,
you know, man stuff.
Instead he taught me what he knew:
that being a man was about sacrifice
and doing whatever you can
to take care of
and provide for your family.
But there was another role
I learned how to play from my dad,
who, I discovered,
learned it from his dad,
a state senator
who later in life
had to work nights as a janitor
to support his family,
and he never told a soul.
That role was to suffer in secret.
And now three generations later,
I find myself playing that role, too.
So why couldn't my grandfather
just reach out to another man
and ask for help?
Why does my dad to this day still think
he's got to do it all on his own?
I know a man who would rather die
than tell another man
that they're hurting.
But it's not because we're just all,
like, strong silent types.
It's not. A lot of us men are really good
at making friends, and talking,
just not about anything real.
(Laughter)
If it's about work or sports
or politics or women,
we have no problem sharing our opinions,
but if it's about
our insecurities or our struggles,
our fear of failure,
then it's almost like we become paralyzed.
At least, I do.
So some of the ways
that I have been practicing
breaking free of this behavior
are by creating experiences
that force me to be vulnerable.
So if there's something
I'm experiencing shame around in my life,
I practice diving straight into it,
no matter how scary it is --
and sometimes, even publicly.
Because then in doing so
I take away its power,
and my display of vulnerability
can in some cases give other men
permission to do the same.
As an example, a little while ago
I was wrestling with an issue in my life
that I knew I needed
to talk to my guy friends about,
but I was so paralyzed by fear
that they would judge me
and see me as weak
and I would lose my standing as a leader
that I knew I had to take them
out of town on a three-day guys trip --
(Laughter)
Just to open up. And guess what?
It wasn't until the end of the third day
that I finally found
the strength to talk to them
about what I was going through.
But when I did,
something amazing happened.
I realized that I wasn't alone,
because my guys had also been struggling.
And as soon as I found the strength
and the courage to share my shame,
it was gone.
Now, I've learned over time
that if I want to practice vulnerability,
then I need to build myself
a system of accountability.
So I've been really blessed as an actor.
I've built a really wonderful fan base,
really, really sweet and engaged,
and so I decided to use my social platform
as kind of this Trojan horse
wherein I could create a daily practice
of authenticity and vulnerability.
The response has been incredible.
It's been affirming,
it's been heartwarming.
I get tons of love and press
and positive messages daily.
But it's all from a certain demographic:
women.
(Laughter)
This is real.
Why are only women following me?
Where are the men?
(Laughter)
About a year ago, I posted this photo.
Now, afterwards, I was scrolling
through some of the comments,
and I noticed that one of my female fans
had tagged her boyfriend in the picture,
and her boyfriend responded by saying,
"Please stop tagging me in gay shit.
Thx."
(Laughter)
As if being gay makes you
less of a man, right?
So I took a deep breath,
and I responded.
I said,
very politely, that I was just curious,
because I'm on an exploration
of masculinity,
and I wanted to know
why my love for my wife
qualified as gay shit.
And then I said,
honestly I just wanted to learn.
(Laughter)
Now, he immediately wrote me back.
I thought he was going to go off on me,
but instead he apologized.
He told me how, growing up,
public displays of affection
were looked down on.
He told me that he was wrestling
and struggling with his ego,
and how much he loved his girlfriend
and how thankful he was for her patience.
And then a few weeks later,
he messaged me again.
This time he sent me a photo
of him on one knee proposing.
(Applause)
And all he said was, "Thank you."
I've been this guy.
I get it.
See, publicly,
he was just playing his role,
rejecting the feminine, right?
But secretly he was waiting
for permission to express himself,
to be seen, to be heard,
and all he needed was another man
holding him accountable
and creating a safe space for him to feel,
and the transformation was instant.
I loved this experience,
because it showed me
that transformation is possible,
even over direct messages.
So I wanted to figure out
how I could reach more men,
but of course none of them
were following me.
(Laughter)
So I tried an experiment.
I started posting more
stereotypically masculine things --
(Laughter)
Like my challenging workouts,
my meal plans,
my journey to heal my body
after an injury.
And guess what happened?
Men started to write me.
And then, out of the blue,
for the first time in my entire career,
a male fitness magazine called me,
and they said they wanted to honor me
as one of their game-changers.
(Laughter)
Was that really game-changing?
Or is it just conforming?
And see, that's the problem.
It's totally cool for men to follow me
when I talk about guy stuff
and I conform to gender norms.
But if I talk about
how much I love my wife
or my daughter or my 10-day-old son,
how I believe that marriage
is challenging but beautiful,
or how as a man
I struggle with body dysmorphia,
or if I promote gender equality,
then only the women show up.
Where are the men?
So men, men, men,
men!
(Applause)
I understand.
Growing up, we tend
to challenge each other.
We've got to be the toughest,
the strongest, the bravest
men that we can be.
And for many of us, myself included,
our identities are wrapped up
in whether or not at the end of the day
we feel like we're man enough.
But I've got a challenge for all the guys,
because men love challenges.
(Laughter)
I challenge you to see
if you can use the same qualities
that you feel make you a man
to go deeper into yourself.
Your strength, your bravery,
your toughness:
Can we redefine what those mean
and use them to explore our hearts?
Are you brave enough
to be vulnerable?
To reach out to another man
when you need help?
To dive headfirst into your shame?
Are you strong enough to be sensitive,
to cry whether you are hurting
or you're happy,
even if it makes you look weak?
Are you confident enough
to listen to the women in your life?
To hear their ideas and their solutions?
To hold their anguish
and actually believe them,
even if what they're saying
is against you?
And will you be man enough
to stand up to other men
when you hear "locker room talk,"
when you hear stories
of sexual harassment?
When you hear your boys talking
about grabbing ass or getting her drunk,
will you actually stand up
and do something
so that one day
we don't have to live in a world
where a woman has to risk everything
and come forward
to say the words "me too?"
(Applause)
This is serious stuff.
I've had to take a real, honest look
at the ways that I've unconsciously
been hurting the women in my life,
and it's ugly.
My wife told me that I had been
acting in a certain way that hurt her
and not correcting it.
Basically, sometimes
when she would go to speak,
at home or in public,
I would just cut her off mid-sentence
and finish her thought for her.
It's awful.
The worst part was that I was completely
unaware when I was doing it.
It was unconscious.
So here I am doing my part,
trying to be a feminist,
amplifying the voices
of women around the world,
and yet at home,
I am using my louder voice
to silence the woman I love the most.
So I had to ask myself a tough question:
am I man enough
to just shut the hell up and listen?
(Laughter)
(Applause)
I've got to be honest.
I wish that didn't get an applause.
(Laughter)
Guys,
this is real.
And I'm just scratching the surface here,
because the deeper we go,
the uglier it gets, I guarantee you.
I don't have time to get into porn
and violence against women
or the split of domestic duties
or the gender pay gap.
But I believe that as men,
it's time we start to see
past our privilege
and recognize that we are
not just part of the problem.
Fellas, we are the problem.
The glass ceiling exists
because we put it there,
and if we want to be
a part of the solution,
then words are no longer enough.
There's a quote that I love that
I grew up with from the Bahá'í writings.
It says that "the world of humanity
is possessed of two wings,
the male and the female.
So long as these two wings
are not equivalent in strength,
the bird will not fly."
So women,
on behalf of men all over the world
who feel similar to me,
please forgive us
for all the ways that we have not
relied on your strength.
And now I would like
to ask you to formally help us,
because we cannot do this alone.
We are men. We're going to mess up.
We're going to say the wrong thing.
We're going to be tone-deaf.
We're more than likely, probably,
going to offend you.
But don't lose hope.
We're only here because of you,
and like you, as men, we need
to stand up and become your allies
as you fight against
pretty much everything.
We need your help
in celebrating our vulnerability
and being patient with us
as we make this very, very long journey
from our heads to our hearts.
And finally to parents:
instead of teaching our children
to be brave boys or pretty girls,
can we maybe just teach them
how to be good humans?
So back to my dad.
Growing up, yeah, like every boy,
I had my fair share of issues,
but now I realize that it was
even thanks to his sensitivity
and emotional intelligence
that I am able to stand here right now
talking to you in the first place.
The resentment I had for my dad
I now realize had nothing to do with him.
It had everything to do with me
and my longing to be accepted
and to play a role
that was never meant for me.
So while my dad may have not taught me
how to use my hands,
he did teach me how to use my heart,
and to me that makes him
more a man than anything.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Ladies and gentlemen, at TED
we talk a lot about leadership
and how to make a movement.
So let's watch a movement happen,
start to finish,
in under three minutes
and dissect some lessons from it.
First, of course you know,
a leader needs the guts
to stand out and be ridiculed.
What he's doing is so easy to follow.
Here's his first follower
with a crucial role;
he's going to show everyone
else how to follow.
Now, notice that the leader
embraces him as an equal.
Now it's not about the leader anymore;
it's about them, plural.
Now, there he is calling to his friends.
Now, if you notice that the first follower
is actually an underestimated form
of leadership in itself.
It takes guts to stand out like that.
The first follower is what transforms
a lone nut into a leader.
(Laughter)
(Applause)
And here comes a second follower.
Now it's not a lone nut,
it's not two nuts --
three is a crowd, and a crowd is news.
So a movement must be public.
It's important to show
not just the leader, but the followers,
because you find that new followers
emulate the followers, not the leader.
Now, here come two more people,
and immediately after,
three more people.
Now we've got momentum.
This is the tipping point.
Now we've got a movement.
(Laughter)
So, notice that, as more people join in,
it's less risky.
So those that were sitting
on the fence before
now have no reason not to.
They won't stand out,
they won't be ridiculed,
but they will be part
of the in-crowd if they hurry.
(Laughter)
So, over the next minute,
you'll see all of those that prefer
to stick with the crowd
because eventually they would be
ridiculed for not joining in.
And that's how you make a movement.
But let's recap some lessons from this.
So first, if you are the type,
like the shirtless dancing guy
that is standing alone,
remember the importance of nurturing
your first few followers as equals
so it's clearly
about the movement, not you.
(Laughter)
Okay, but we might have missed
the real lesson here.
The biggest lesson, if you noticed --
did you catch it? --
is that leadership is over-glorified.
Yes, it was the shirtless guy
who was first,
and he'll get all the credit,
but it was really the first follower
that transformed the lone nut
into a leader.
So, as we're told
that we should all be leaders,
that would be really ineffective.
If you really care
about starting a movement,
have the courage to follow
and show others how to follow.
And when you find a lone nut
doing something great,
have the guts to be the first one
to stand up and join in.
And what a perfect place
to do that, at TED.
Thanks.
(Applause)
This is the exact moment
that I started creating something called Tinkering School.
Tinkering School is a place where kids can pick up sticks
and hammers and other dangerous objects,
and be trusted.
Trusted not to hurt themselves,
and trusted not to hurt others.
Tinkering School doesn't follow a set curriculum,
and there are no tests.
We're not trying to teach anybody any specific thing.
When the kids arrive
they're confronted with lots of stuff:
wood and nails and rope and wheels,
and lots of tools, real tools.
It's a six-day immersive experience for the kids.
And within that context, we can offer the kids time --
something that seems in short supply
in their over-scheduled lives.
Our goal is to ensure that they leave
with a better sense of how to make things
than when they arrived,
and the deep internal realization
that you can figure things out by fooling around.
Nothing ever turns out as planned ... ever.
(Laughter)
And the kids soon learn
that all projects go awry --
(Laughter)
and become at ease with the idea that every step
in a project is a step closer
to sweet success,
or gleeful calamity.
We start from doodles and sketches.
And sometimes we make real plans.
And sometimes we just start building.
Building is at the heart of the experience:
hands on, deeply immersed
and fully committed to the problem at hand.
Robin and I, acting as collaborators,
keep the landscape of the projects
tilted towards completion.
Success is in the doing,
and failures are celebrated and analyzed.
Problems become puzzles
and obstacles disappear.
When faced with particularly difficult
setbacks or complexities,
a really interesting behavior emerges: decoration.
(Laughter)
Decoration of the unfinished project
is a kind of conceptual incubation.
From these interludes come deep insights
and amazing new approaches to solving the problems
that had them frustrated just moments before.
All materials are available for use.
Even those mundane, hateful, plastic grocery bags
can become a bridge
stronger than anyone imagined.
And the things that they build
amaze even themselves.

Gever Tulley: A rollercoaster built by seven-year-olds.
Video: Yay!
(Applause)
GT: Thank you. It's been a great pleasure.

A few years ago,
I broke into my own house.
I had just driven home,
it was around midnight
in the dead of Montreal winter,
I had been visiting my friend,
Jeff, across town,
and the thermometer on the front porch
read minus 40 degrees --
and don't bother asking
if that's Celsius or Fahrenheit,
minus 40 is where the two scales meet --
it was very cold.
And as I stood on the front porch
fumbling in my pockets,
I found I didn't have my keys.
In fact, I could see them
through the window,
lying on the dining room table
where I had left them.
So I quickly ran around
and tried all the other doors and windows,
and they were locked tight.
I thought about calling a locksmith --
at least I had my cellphone,
but at midnight, it could take a while
for a locksmith to show up,
and it was cold.
I couldn't go back to my friend
Jeff's house for the night
because I had an early flight
to Europe the next morning,
and I needed to get
my passport and my suitcase.
So, desperate and freezing cold,
I found a large rock and I broke
through the basement window,
cleared out the shards of glass,
I crawled through,
I found a piece of cardboard
and taped it up over the opening,
figuring that in the morning,
on the way to the airport,
I could call my contractor
and ask him to fix it.
This was going to be expensive,
but probably no more expensive
than a middle-of-the-night locksmith,
so I figured, under the circumstances,
I was coming out even.
Now, I'm a neuroscientist by training
and I know a little bit
about how the brain performs under stress.
It releases cortisol
that raises your heart rate,
it modulates adrenaline levels
and it clouds your thinking.
So the next morning,
when I woke up on too little sleep,
worrying about the hole in the window,
and a mental note
that I had to call my contractor,
and the freezing temperatures,
and the meetings I had upcoming in Europe,
and, you know, with all
the cortisol in my brain,
my thinking was cloudy,
but I didn't know it was cloudy
because my thinking was cloudy.
(Laughter)
And it wasn't until I got
to the airport check-in counter,
that I realized I didn't have my passport.
(Laughter)
So I raced home in the snow
and ice, 40 minutes,
got my passport,
raced back to the airport,
I made it just in time,
but they had given away
my seat to someone else,
so I got stuck in the back of the plane,
next to the bathrooms,
in a seat that wouldn't recline,
on an eight-hour flight.
Well, I had a lot of time to think
during those eight hours and no sleep.
(Laughter)
And I started wondering,
are there things that I can do,
systems that I can put into place,
that will prevent bad things
from happening?
Or at least if bad things happen,
will minimize the likelihood
of it being a total catastrophe.
So I started thinking about that,
but my thoughts didn't crystallize
until about a month later.
I was having dinner with my colleague,
Danny Kahneman, the Nobel Prize winner,
and I somewhat embarrassedly told him
about having broken my window,
and, you know, forgotten my passport,
and Danny shared with me
that he'd been practicing
something called prospective hindsight.
(Laughter)
It's something that he had gotten
from the psychologist Gary Klein,
who had written about it
a few years before,
also called the pre-mortem.
Now, you all know what the postmortem is.
Whenever there's a disaster,
a team of experts come in and they try
to figure out what went wrong, right?
Well, in the pre-mortem, Danny explained,
you look ahead and you try to figure out
all the things that could go wrong,
and then you try to figure out
what you can do
to prevent those things from happening,
or to minimize the damage.
So what I want to talk to you about today
are some of the things we can do
in the form of a pre-mortem.
Some of them are obvious,
some of them are not so obvious.
I'll start with the obvious ones.
Around the home, designate a place
for things that are easily lost.
Now, this sounds
like common sense, and it is,
but there's a lot of science
to back this up,
based on the way our spatial memory works.
There's a structure in the brain
called the hippocampus,
that evolved over tens
of thousands of years,
to keep track of the locations
of important things --
where the well is,
where fish can be found,
that stand of fruit trees,
where the friendly and enemy tribes live.
The hippocampus is the part of the brain
that in London taxicab drivers
becomes enlarged.
It's the part of the brain
that allows squirrels to find their nuts.
And if you're wondering,
somebody actually did the experiment
where they cut off
the olfactory sense of the squirrels,
and they could still find their nuts.
They weren't using smell,
they were using the hippocampus,
this exquisitely evolved mechanism
in the brain for finding things.
But it's really good for things
that don't move around much,
not so good for things that move around.
So this is why we lose car keys
and reading glasses and passports.
So in the home,
designate a spot for your keys --
a hook by the door,
maybe a decorative bowl.
For your passport, a particular drawer.
For your reading glasses,
a particular table.
If you designate a spot
and you're scrupulous about it,
your things will always be there
when you look for them.
What about travel?
Take a cell phone picture
of your credit cards,
your driver's license, your passport,
mail it to yourself so it's in the cloud.
If these things are lost or stolen,
you can facilitate replacement.
Now these are some rather obvious things.
Remember, when you're under stress,
the brain releases cortisol.
Cortisol is toxic,
and it causes cloudy thinking.
So part of the practice of the pre-mortem
is to recognize that under stress
you're not going to be at your best,
and you should put systems in place.
And there's perhaps
no more stressful a situation
than when you're confronted
with a medical decision to make.
And at some point, all of us
are going to be in that position,
where we have to make
a very important decision
about the future of our medical care
or that of a loved one,
to help them with a decision.
And so I want to talk about that.
And I'm going to talk about
a very particular medical condition.
But this stands as a proxy for all kinds
of medical decision-making,
and indeed for financial decision-making,
and social decision-making --
any kind of decision you have to make
that would benefit from a rational
assessment of the facts.
So suppose you go to your doctor
and the doctor says,
"I just got your lab work back,
your cholesterol's a little high."
Now, you all know that high cholesterol
is associated with an increased risk
of cardiovascular disease,
heart attack, stroke.
And so you're thinking
having high cholesterol
isn't the best thing,
and so the doctor says,
"You know, I'd like to give you a drug
that will help you
lower your cholesterol, a statin."
And you've probably heard of statins,
you know that they're among
the most widely prescribed drugs
in the world today,
you probably even know
people who take them.
And so you're thinking,
"Yeah! Give me the statin."
But there's a question
you should ask at this point,
a statistic you should ask for
that most doctors
don't like talking about,
and pharmaceutical companies
like talking about even less.
It's for the number needed to treat.
Now, what is this, the NNT?
It's the number of people
that need to take a drug
or undergo a surgery
or any medical procedure
before one person is helped.
And you're thinking,
what kind of crazy statistic is that?
The number should be one.
My doctor wouldn't prescribe
something to me
if it's not going to help.
But actually, medical practice
doesn't work that way.
And it's not the doctor's fault,
if it's anybody's fault,
it's the fault of scientists like me.
We haven't figured out
the underlying mechanisms well enough.
But GlaxoSmithKline estimates
that 90 percent of the drugs work
in only 30 to 50 percent of the people.
So the number needed to treat
for the most widely prescribed statin,
what do you suppose it is?
How many people have to take it
before one person is helped?
300.
This is according to research
by research practitioners
Jerome Groopman and Pamela Hartzband,
independently confirmed by Bloomberg.com.
I ran through the numbers myself.
300 people have to
take the drug for a year
before one heart attack, stroke
or other adverse event is prevented.
Now you're probably thinking,
"Well, OK, one in 300 chance
of lowering my cholesterol.
Why not, doc? Give me
the prescription anyway."
But you should ask at this point
for another statistic,
and that is, "Tell me
about the side effects." Right?
So for this particular drug,
the side effects occur
in five percent of the patients.
And they include terrible things --
debilitating muscle and joint pain,
gastrointestinal distress --
but now you're thinking, "Five percent,
not very likely
it's going to happen to me,
I'll still take the drug."
But wait a minute.
Remember under stress
you're not thinking clearly.
So think about how you're going
to work through this ahead of time,
so you don't have to manufacture
the chain of reasoning on the spot.
300 people take the drug, right?
One person's helped,
five percent of those 300
have side effects,
that's 15 people.
You're 15 times more likely
to be harmed by the drug
than you are to be helped by the drug.
Now, I'm not saying whether you
should take the statin or not.
I'm just saying you should have
this conversation with your doctor.
Medical ethics requires it,
it's part of the principle
of informed consent.
You have the right to have access
to this kind of information
to begin the conversation about whether
you want to take the risks or not.
Now you might be thinking
I've pulled this number
out of the air for shock value,
but in fact it's rather typical,
this number needed to treat.
For the most widely performed surgery
on men over the age of 50,
removal of the prostate for cancer,
the number needed to treat is 49.
That's right, 49 surgeries are done
for every one person who's helped.
And the side effects in that case
occur in 50 percent of the patients.
They include impotence,
erectile dysfunction,
urinary incontinence, rectal tearing,
fecal incontinence.
And if you're lucky, and you're one
of the 50 percent who has these,
they'll only last for a year or two.
So the idea of the pre-mortem
is to think ahead of time
to the questions
that you might be able to ask
that will push the conversation forward.
You don't want to have to manufacture
all of this on the spot.
And you also want to think
about things like quality of life.
Because you have a choice oftentimes,
do you I want a shorter life
that's pain-free,
or a longer life that might have
a great deal of pain towards the end?
These are things to talk about
and think about now,
with your family and your loved ones.
You might change your mind
in the heat of the moment,
but at least you're practiced
with this kind of thinking.
Remember, our brain under stress
releases cortisol,
and one of the things
that happens at that moment
is a whole bunch on systems shut down.
There's an evolutionary reason for this.
Face-to-face with a predator,
you don't need your digestive system,
or your libido, or your immune system,
because if you're body is expending
metabolism on those things
and you don't react quickly,
you might become the lion's lunch,
and then none of those things matter.
Unfortunately,
one of the things that goes out the window
during those times of stress
is rational, logical thinking,
as Danny Kahneman
and his colleagues have shown.
So we need to train ourselves
to think ahead
to these kinds of situations.
I think the important point here
is recognizing that all of us are flawed.
We all are going to fail now and then.
The idea is to think ahead
to what those failures might be,
to put systems in place
that will help minimize the damage,
or to prevent the bad things
from happening in the first place.
Getting back to that
snowy night in Montreal,
when I got back from my trip,
I had my contractor install
a combination lock next to the door,
with a key to the front door in it,
an easy to remember combination.
And I have to admit,
I still have piles of mail
that haven't been sorted,
and piles of emails
that I haven't gone through.
So I'm not completely organized,
but I see organization
as a gradual process,
and I'm getting there.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
What I'm going to show you first,
as quickly as I can,
is some foundational work,
some new technology
that we brought to Microsoft
as part of an acquisition
almost exactly a year ago.
This is Seadragon, and it's an environment
in which you can either
locally or remotely interact
with vast amounts of visual data.
We're looking at many, many gigabytes
of digital photos here
and kind of seamlessly
and continuously zooming in,
panning through it,
rearranging it in any way we want.
And it doesn't matter how much
information we're looking at,
how big these collections are
or how big the images are.
Most of them are ordinary
digital camera photos,
but this one, for example,
is a scan from the Library of Congress,
and it's in the 300 megapixel range.
It doesn't make any difference
because the only thing that ought to limit
the performance of a system like this one
is the number of pixels on your screen
at any given moment.
It's also very flexible architecture.
This is an entire book,
so this is an example of non-image data.
This is "Bleak House" by Dickens.
Every column is a chapter.
To prove to you that it's really text,
and not an image,
we can do something
like so, to really show
that this is a real representation
of the text; it's not a picture.
Maybe this is an artificial way
to read an e-book.
I wouldn't recommend it.
This is a more realistic case,
an issue of The Guardian.
Every large image
is the beginning of a section.
And this really gives you
the joy and the good experience
of reading the real paper version
of a magazine or a newspaper,
which is an inherently
multi-scale kind of medium.
We've done something
with the corner of this particular
issue of The Guardian.
We've made up a fake ad
that's very high resolution --
much higher than in an ordinary ad --
and we've embedded extra content.
If you want to see the features
of this car, you can see it here.
Or other models,
or even technical specifications.
And this really gets
at some of these ideas
about really doing away
with those limits on screen real estate.
We hope that this means no more pop-ups
and other rubbish like that --
shouldn't be necessary.
Of course, mapping is one
of those obvious applications
for a technology like this.
And this one I really
won't spend any time on,
except to say that we have things
to contribute to this field as well.
But those are all the roads in the U.S.
superimposed on top
of a NASA geospatial image.
So let's pull up, now, something else.
This is actually live on the Web now;
you can go check it out.
This is a project called Photosynth,
which marries two different technologies.
One of them is Seadragon
and the other is some very
beautiful computer-vision research
done by Noah Snavely, a graduate student
at the University of Washington,
co-advised by Steve Seitz at U.W.
and Rick Szeliski at Microsoft Research.
A very nice collaboration.
And so this is live on the Web.
It's powered by Seadragon.
You can see that
when we do these sorts of views,
where we can dive through images
and have this kind
of multi-resolution experience.
But the spatial arrangement of the images
here is actually meaningful.
The computer vision algorithms
have registered these images together
so that they correspond to the real
space in which these shots --
all taken near Grassi Lakes
in the Canadian Rockies --
all these shots were taken.
So you see elements here
of stabilized slide-show
or panoramic imaging,
and these things have
all been related spatially.
I'm not sure if I have time
to show you any other environments.
Some are much more spatial.
I would like to jump straight
to one of Noah's original data-sets --
this is from an early prototype
that we first got working this summer --
to show you what I think
is really the punch line
behind the Photosynth technology,
It's not necessarily so apparent
from looking at the environments
we've put up on the website.
We had to worry
about the lawyers and so on.
This is a reconstruction
of Notre Dame Cathedral
that was done entirely computationally
from images scraped from Flickr.
You just type Notre Dame into Flickr,
and you get some pictures of guys
in T-shirts, and of the campus and so on.
And each of these orange cones
represents an image
that was discovered
to belong to this model.
And so these are all Flickr images,
and they've all been related
spatially in this way.
We can just navigate
in this very simple way.
(Applause)
(Applause ends)
You know, I never thought
that I'd end up working at Microsoft.
It's very gratifying to have
this kind of reception here.
(Laughter)
I guess you can see this is
lots of different types of cameras:
it's everything from cell-phone cameras
to professional SLRs,
quite a large number of them,
stitched together in this environment.
If I can find some
of the sort of weird ones --
So many of them are occluded
by faces, and so on.
Somewhere in here there is actually
a series of photographs -- here we go.
This is actually a poster of Notre Dame
that registered correctly.
We can dive in from the poster
to a physical view of this environment.
What the point here really is
is that we can do things
with the social environment.
This is now taking data from everybody --
from the entire collective memory,
visually, of what the Earth looks like --
and link all of that together.
Those photos become linked,
and they make something emergent
that's greater than the sum of the parts.
You have a model that emerges
of the entire Earth.
Think of this as the long tail
to Stephen Lawler's Virtual Earth work.
And this is something that grows
in complexity as people use it,
and whose benefits become greater
to the users as they use it.
Their own photos are getting tagged
with meta-data that somebody else entered.
If somebody bothered
to tag all of these saints
and say who they all are,
then my photo of Notre Dame Cathedral
suddenly gets enriched
with all of that data,
and I can use it as an entry point
to dive into that space,
into that meta-verse,
using everybody else's photos,
and do a kind of a cross-modal
and cross-user social experience that way.
And of course, a by-product of all of that
is immensely rich virtual models
of every interesting part of the Earth,
collected not just from overhead flights
and from satellite images
and so on, but from the collective memory.
Thank you so much.
(Applause)
(Applause ends)
Chris Anderson:
Do I understand this right?
What your software is going to allow,
is that at some point,
really within the next few years,
all the pictures that are shared
by anyone across the world
are going to link together?
BAA: Yes. What this is really
doing is discovering,
creating hyperlinks,
if you will, between images.
It's doing that based on the content
inside the images.
And that gets really exciting
when you think about the richness
of the semantic information
a lot of images have.
Like when you do a web search for images,
you type in phrases,
and the text on the web page is carrying
a lot of information
about what that picture is of.
What if that picture links
to all of your pictures?
The amount of semantic
interconnection and richness
that comes out of that is really huge.
It's a classic network effect.
CA: Truly incredible. Congratulations.
When we talk about corruption,
there are typical types
of individuals that spring to mind.
There's the former Soviet megalomaniacs.
Saparmurat Niyazov, he was one of them.
Until his death in 2006,
he was the all-powerful
leader of Turkmenistan,
a Central Asian country
rich in natural gas.
Now, he really loved to issue
presidential decrees.
And one renamed the months of the year
including after himself and his mother.
He spent millions of dollars
creating a bizarre personality cult,
and his crowning glory was the building
of a 40-foot-high gold-plated
statue of himself
which stood proudly
in the capital's central square
and rotated to follow the sun.
He was a slightly unusual guy.
And then there's that cliché,
the African dictator
or minister or official.
There's Teodorín Obiang.
So his daddy is president
for life of Equatorial Guinea,
a West African nation that has exported
billions of dollars of oil since the 1990s
and yet has a truly appalling
human rights record.
The vast majority of its people
are living in really miserable poverty
despite an income
per capita that's on a par
with that of Portugal.
So Obiang junior, well, he buys himself
a $30 million mansion
in Malibu, California.
I've been up to its front gates.
I can tell you it's a magnificent spread.
He bought an €18 million art collection
that used to belong to fashion
designer Yves Saint Laurent,
a stack of fabulous sports cars,
some costing a million dollars apiece --
oh, and a Gulfstream jet, too.
Now get this:
Until recently, he was earning
an official monthly salary
of less than 7,000 dollars.
And there's Dan Etete.
Well, he was the former
oil minister of Nigeria
under President Abacha,
and it just so happens
he's a convicted money launderer too.
We've spent a great deal of time
investigating a $1 billion --
that's right, a $1 billion —
oil deal that he was involved with,
and what we found was pretty shocking,
but more about that later.
So it's easy to think
that corruption happens
somewhere over there,
carried out by a bunch of greedy despots
and individuals up to no good in countries
that we, personally, may
know very little about
and feel really unconnected to
and unaffected by what might be going on.
But does it just happen over there?
Well, at 22, I was very lucky.
My first job out of university
was investigating the illegal
trade in African ivory.
And that's how my relationship
with corruption really began.
In 1993, with two friends
who were colleagues,
Simon Taylor and Patrick Alley,
we set up an organization
called Global Witness.
Our first campaign
was investigating the role
of illegal logging in funding
the war in Cambodia.
So a few years later, and it's now 1997,
and I'm in Angola undercover
investigating blood diamonds.
Perhaps you saw the film,
the Hollywood film "Blood Diamond,"
the one with Leonardo DiCaprio.
Well, some of that sprang from our work.
Luanda, it was full of land mine victims
who were struggling
to survive on the streets
and war orphans living
in sewers under the streets,
and a tiny, very wealthy elite
who gossiped about shopping
trips to Brazil and Portugal.
And it was a slightly crazy place.
So I'm sitting in a hot
and very stuffy hotel room
feeling just totally overwhelmed.
But it wasn't about blood diamonds.
Because I'd been speaking
to lots of people there
who, well, they talked
about a different problem:
that of a massive web
of corruption on a global scale
and millions of oil dollars going missing.
And for what was then
a very small organization
of just a few people,
trying to even begin to think
how we might tackle that
was an enormous challenge.
And in the years that I've been,
and we've all been campaigning
and investigating,
I've repeatedly seen
that what makes corruption
on a global, massive scale possible,
well it isn't just greed
or the misuse of power
or that nebulous phrase "weak governance."
I mean, yes, it's all of those,
but corruption, it's made
possible by the actions
of global facilitators.
So let's go back to some of those
people I talked about earlier.
Now, they're all people
we've investigated,
and they're all people who couldn't
do what they do alone.
Take Obiang junior. Well, he didn't end up
with high-end art and luxury
houses without help.
He did business with global banks.
A bank in Paris held accounts
of companies controlled by him,
one of which was used to buy the art,
and American banks, well, they funneled
73 million dollars into the States,
some of which was used to buy
that California mansion.
And he didn't do all of this
in his own name either.
He used shell companies.
He used one to buy
the property, and another,
which was in somebody else's name,
to pay the huge bills it
cost to run the place.
And then there's Dan Etete.
Well, when he was oil minister,
he awarded an oil block now
worth over a billion dollars
to a company that, guess what, yeah,
he was the hidden owner of.
Now, it was then much later traded on
with the kind assistance
of the Nigerian government --
now I have to be careful what I say here —
to subsidiaries of Shell
and the Italian Eni,
two of the biggest oil companies around.
So the reality is,
is that the engine of corruption,
well, it exists far
beyond the shores of countries
like Equatorial Guinea
or Nigeria or Turkmenistan.
This engine, well, it's driven
by our international banking system,
by the problem of anonymous
shell companies,
and by the secrecy that we have afforded
big oil, gas and mining operations,
and, most of all, by the failure
of our politicians
to back up their rhetoric and do something
really meaningful and systemic
to tackle this stuff.
Now let's take the banks first.
Well, it's not going
to come as any surprise
for me to tell you that banks
accept dirty money,
but they prioritize their profits
in other destructive ways too.
For example, in Sarawak, Malaysia.
Now this region, it has just five percent
of its forests left intact. Five percent.
So how did that happen?
Well, because an elite
and its facilitators
have been making millions of dollars
from supporting logging
on an industrial scale
for many years.
So we sent an undercover investigator in
to secretly film meetings
with members of the ruling elite,
and the resulting footage, well,
it made some people very angry,
and you can see that on YouTube,
but it proved what we had long suspected,
because it showed
how the state's chief minister,
despite his later denials,
used his control over land
and forest licenses
to enrich himself and his family.
And HSBC, well, we know
that HSBC bankrolled
the region's largest logging companies
that were responsible
for some of that destruction
in Sarawak and elsewhere.
The bank violated its own
sustainability policies in the process,
but it earned around 130 million dollars.
Now shortly after our exposé,
very shortly after our exposé
earlier this year,
the bank announced
a policy review on this.
And is this progress? Maybe,
but we're going to be
keeping a very close eye
on that case.
And then there's the problem
of anonymous shell companies.
Well, we've all heard
about what they are, I think,
and we all know they're used quite a bit
by people and companies
who are trying to avoid
paying their proper dues to society,
also known as taxes.
But what doesn't usually come to light
is how shell companies are used to steal
huge sums of money,
transformational sums of money,
from poor countries.
In virtually every case of corruption
that we've investigated,
shell companies have appeared,
and sometimes
it's been impossible to find out
who is really involved in the deal.
A recent study by the World Bank
looked at 200 cases of corruption.
It found that over 70
percent of those cases
had used anonymous shell companies,
totaling almost 56 billion dollars.
Now many of these
companies were in America
or the United Kingdom,
its overseas territories
and Crown dependencies,
and so it's not just an offshore problem,
it's an on-shore one too.
You see, shell companies, they're central
to the secret deals which may
benefit wealthy elites
rather than ordinary citizens.
One striking recent case
that we've investigated
is how the government
in the Democratic Republic of Congo
sold off a series of valuable,
state-owned mining assets
to shell companies
in the British Virgin Islands.
So we spoke to sources in country,
trawled through company
documents and other information
trying to piece together a really
true picture of the deal.
And we were alarmed to find
that these shell companies
had quickly flipped many of the assets on
for huge profits to major
international mining companies
listed in London.
Now, the Africa Progress
Panel, led by Kofi Annan,
they've calculated
that Congo may have lost
more than 1.3 billion dollars
from these deals.
That's almost twice
the country's annual health
and education budget combined.
And will the people of Congo,
will they ever get their money back?
Well, the answer to that question,
and who was really involved
and what really happened,
well that's going to probably
remain locked away
in the secretive company registries
of the British Virgin Islands
and elsewhere unless we all do
something about it.
And how about the oil, gas
and mining companies?
Okay, maybe it's a bit
of a cliché to talk about them.
Corruption in that sector, no surprise.
There's corruption everywhere,
so why focus on that sector?
Well, because there's a lot at stake.
In 2011, natural resource exports
outweighed aid flows by almost 19 to one
in Africa, Asia and Latin America.
Nineteen to one.
Now that's a hell of a lot
of schools and universities
and hospitals and business startups,
many of which haven't
materialized and never will
because some of that money
has simply been stolen away.
Now let's go back to the oil
and mining companies,
and let's go back to Dan Etete
and that $1 billion deal.
And now forgive me, I'm
going to read the next bit
because it's a very live
issue, and our lawyers
have been through this in some detail
and they want me to get it right.
Now, on the surface, the deal
appeared straightforward.
Subsidiaries of Shell and Eni
paid the Nigerian
government for the block.
The Nigerian government transferred
precisely the same amount,
to the very dollar,
to an account earmarked
for a shell company
whose hidden owner was Etete.
Now, that's not bad going
for a convicted money launderer.
And here's the thing.
After many months of digging around
and reading through hundreds
of pages of court documents,
we found evidence that, in fact,
Shell and Eni had known that the funds
would be transferred
to that shell company,
and frankly, it's hard
to believe they didn't know
who they were really dealing with there.
Now, it just shouldn't take
these sorts of efforts
to find out where the money
in deals like this went.
I mean, these are state assets.
They're supposed to be
used for the benefit
of the people in the country.
But in some countries,
citizens and journalists
who are trying to expose stories like this
have been harassed and arrested
and some have even risked
their lives to do so.
And finally, well, there
are those who believe
that corruption is unavoidable.
It's just how some business is done.
It's too complex and difficult to change.
So in effect, what? We just accept it.
But as a campaigner and investigator,
I have a different view,
because I've seen what can happen
when an idea gains momentum.
In the oil and mining sector, for example,
there is now the beginning
of a truly worldwide transparency standard
that could tackle some of these problems.
In 1999, when Global Witness called
for oil companies to make
payments on deals transparent,
well, some people laughed
at the extreme naiveté
of that small idea.
But literally hundreds
of civil society groups
from around the world came together
to fight for transparency,
and now it's fast becoming
the norm and the law.
Two thirds of the value
of the world's oil and mining companies
are now covered by transparency laws.
Two thirds.
So this is change happening.
This is progress.
But we're not there yet, by far.
Because it really isn't about corruption
somewhere over there, is it?
In a globalized world, corruption
is a truly globalized business,
and one that needs global solutions,
supported and pushed by us
all, as global citizens,
right here.
Thank you.
(Applause)
I'm here to share my photography.
Or is it photography?
Because, of course, this is a photograph
that you can't take with your camera.
Yet, my interest in photography started
as I got my first digital camera
at the age of 15.
It mixed with my earlier passion for drawing,
but it was a bit different,
because using the camera,
the process was in the planning instead.
And when you take a photograph with a camera,
the process ends when you press the trigger.
So to me it felt like photography was more about
being at the right place and the right time.
I felt like anyone could do that.
So I wanted to create something different,
something where the process starts
when you press the trigger.
Photos like this:
construction going on along a busy road.
But it has an unexpected twist.
And despite that,
it retains a level of realism.
Or photos like these --
both dark and colorful,
but all with a common goal
of retaining the level of realism.
When I say realism,
I mean photo-realism.
Because, of course,
it's not something you can capture really,
but I always want it to look like it could have been captured somehow
as a photograph.
Photos where you will need a brief moment to think
to figure out the trick.
So it's more about capturing an idea
than about capturing a moment really.
But what's the trick
that makes it look realistic?
Is it something about the details
or the colors?
Is it something about the light?
What creates the illusion?
Sometimes the perspective is the illusion.
But in the end, it comes down to how we interpret the world
and how it can be realized on a two-dimensional surface.
It's not really what is realistic,
it's what we think looks realistic really.
So I think the basics
are quite simple.
I just see it as a puzzle of reality
where you can take different pieces of reality and put it together
to create alternate reality.
And let me show you a simple example.
Here we have three perfectly imaginable physical objects,
something we all can relate to living in a three-dimensional world.
But combined in a certain way,
they can create something that still looks three-dimensional,
like it could exist.
But at the same time, we know it can't.
So we trick our brains,
because our brain simply doesn't accept the fact
that it doesn't really make sense.
And I see the same process
with combining photographs.
It's just really about combining different realities.
So the things that make a photograph look realistic,
I think it's the things that we don't even think about,
the things all around us in our daily lives.
But when combining photographs,
this is really important to consider,
because otherwise it just looks wrong somehow.
So I would like to say that there are three simple rules to follow
to achieve a realistic result.
As you can see, these images aren't really special.
But combined, they can create something like this.
So the first rule is that photos combined
should have the same perspective.
Secondly, photos combined
should have the same type of light.
And these two images both fulfill these two requirements --
shot at the same height and in the same type of light.
The third one is about making it impossible to distinguish
where the different images begin and end
by making it seamless.
Make it impossible to say
how the image actually was composed.
So by matching color, contrast and brightness
in the borders between the different images,
adding photographic defects
like depth of field,
desaturated colors and noise,
we erase the borders between the different images
and make it look like one single image,
despite the fact that one image
can contain hundreds of layers basically.
So here's another example.
(Laughter)
One might think that this is just an image of a landscape
and the lower part is what's manipulated.
But this image is actually entirely composed
of photographs from different locations.
I personally think that it's easier to actually create a place
than to find a place,
because then you don't need to compromise
with the ideas in your head.
But it does require a lot of planning.
And getting this idea during winter,
I knew that I had several months to plan it,
to find the different locations
for the pieces of the puzzle basically.
So for example,
the fish was captured on a fishing trip.
The shores are from a different location.
The underwater part was captured in a stone pit.
And yeah, I even turned the house on top of the island red
to make it look more Swedish.
So to achieve a realistic result,
I think it comes down to planning.
It always starts with a sketch, an idea.
Then it's about combining the different photographs.
And here every piece is very well planned.
And if you do a good job capturing the photos,
the result can be quite beautiful
and also quite realistic.
So all the tools are out there,
and the only thing that limits us
is our imagination.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Humans in the developed world
spend more than 90 percent of their lives indoors,
where they breathe in and come into contact
with trillions of life forms invisible to the naked eye:
microorganisms.
Buildings are complex ecosystems
that are an important source
of microbes that are good for us,
and some that are bad for us.
What determines the types and distributions
of microbes indoors?
Buildings are colonized by airborne microbes
that enter through windows
and through mechanical ventilation systems.
And they are brought inside
by humans and other creatures.
The fate of microbes indoors
depends on complex interactions
with humans,
and with the human-built environment.
And today, architects and biologists
are working together
to explore smart building design
that will create
healthy buildings for us.
We spend an extraordinary amount of time
in buildings
that are extremely controlled environments,
like this building here --
environments that have mechanical ventilation systems
that include filtering,
heating and air conditioning.
Given the amount of time that we spend indoors,
it's important to understand
how this affects our health.
At the Biology and the Built Environment Center,
we carried out a study in a hospital
where we sampled air
and pulled the DNA
out of microbes in the air.
And we looked at three different types of rooms.
We looked at rooms that were mechanically ventilated,
which are the data points in the blue.
We looked at rooms that were naturally ventilated,
where the hospital let us turn off the mechanical ventilation
in a wing of the building
and pry open the windows
that were no longer operable,
but they made them operable for our study.
And we also sampled the outdoor air.
If you look at the x-axis of this graph,
you'll see that what we commonly want to do --
which is keeping the outdoors out --
we accomplished that with mechanical ventilation.
So if you look at the green data points,
which is air that's outside,
you'll see that there's a large amount of microbial diversity,
or variety of microbial types.
But if you look at the blue data points,
which is mechanically ventilated air,
it's not as diverse.
But being less diverse
is not necessarily good for our health.
If you look at the y-axis of this graph,
you'll see that, in the mechanically ventilated air,
you have a higher probability
of encountering a potential pathogen,
or germ,
than if you're outdoors.
So to understand why this was the case,
we took our data
and put it into an ordination diagram,
which is a statistical map
that tells you something
about how related the microbial communities are
in the different samples.
The data points that are closer together
have microbial communities that are more similar
than data points that are far apart.
And the first things that you can see from this graph
is, if you look at the blue data points,
which are the mechanically ventilated air,
they're not simply a subset of the green data points,
which are the outdoor air.
What we've found is that mechanically ventilated air
looks like humans.
It has microbes on it
that are commonly associated with our skin
and with our mouth, our spit.
And this is because
we're all constantly shedding microbes.
So all of you right now
are sharing your microbes with one another.
And when you're outdoors,
that type of air has microbes
that are commonly associated with plant leaves and with dirt.
Why does this matter?
It matters because the health care industry
is the second most energy intensive industry
in the United States.
Hospitals use two and a half times
the amount of energy as office buildings.
And the model that we're working with
in hospitals,
and also with many, many different buildings,
is to keep the outdoors out.
And this model
may not necessarily be the best for our health.
And given the extraordinary amount
of nosocomial infections,
or hospital-acquired infections,
this is a clue that it's a good time
to reconsider our current practices.
So just as we manage national parks,
where we promote the growth of some species
and we inhibit the growth of others,
we're working towards thinking about buildings
using an ecosystem framework
where we can promote the kinds of microbes
that we want to have indoors.
I've heard somebody say
that you're as healthy as your gut.
And for this reason, many people eat probiotic yogurt
so they can promote a healthy gut flora.
And what we ultimately want to do
is to be able to use this concept
to promote a healthy group
of microorganisms inside.
Thank you.
(Applause)
So a few years ago,
I did something really brave,
or some would say really stupid.
I ran for Congress.
For years, I had existed
safely behind the scenes in politics
as a fundraiser, as an organizer,
but in my heart, I always wanted to run.
The sitting congresswoman
had been in my district since 1992.
She had never lost a race,
and no one had really even run against her
in a Democratic primary.
But in my mind, this was my way
to make a difference,
to disrupt the status quo.
The polls, however,
told a very different story.
My pollsters told me
that I was crazy to run,
that there was no way that I could win.
But I ran anyway,
and in 2012, I became an upstart
in a New York City congressional race.
I swore I was going to win.
I had the endorsement
from the New York Daily News,
the Wall Street Journal
snapped pictures of me on election day,
and CNBC called it one of the hottest
races in the country.
I raised money from everyone I knew,
including Indian aunties
that were just so happy
an Indian girl was running.
But on election day, the polls were right,
and I only got 19 percent of the vote,
and the same papers
that said I was a rising political star
now said I wasted 1.3 million dollars
on 6,321 votes.
Don't do the math.
It was humiliating.
Now, before you get the wrong idea,
this is not a talk
about the importance of failure.
Nor is it about leaning in.
I tell you the story
of how I ran for Congress
because I was 33 years old
and it was the first time
in my entire life
that I had done something
that was truly brave,
where I didn't worry about being perfect.
And I'm not alone:
so many women I talk to tell me
that they gravitate
towards careers and professions
that they know
they're going to be great in,
that they know they're
going to be perfect in,
and it's no wonder why.
Most girls are taught
to avoid risk and failure.
We're taught to smile pretty,
play it safe, get all A's.
Boys, on the other hand,
are taught to play rough, swing high,
crawl to the top of the monkey bars
and then just jump off headfirst.
And by the time they're adults,
whether they're negotiating a raise
or even asking someone out on a date,
they're habituated
to take risk after risk.
They're rewarded for it.
It's often said in Silicon Valley,
no one even takes you seriously
unless you've had two failed start-ups.
In other words,
we're raising our girls to be perfect,
and we're raising our boys to be brave.
Some people worry
about our federal deficit,
but I, I worry about our bravery deficit.
Our economy, our society,
we're just losing out
because we're not raising
our girls to be brave.
The bravery deficit is why
women are underrepresented in STEM,
in C-suites, in boardrooms, in Congress,
and pretty much everywhere you look.
In the 1980s, psychologist Carol Dweck
looked at how bright fifth graders
handled an assignment
that was too difficult for them.
She found that bright girls
were quick to give up.
The higher the IQ,
the more likely they were to give up.
Bright boys, on the other hand,
found the difficult material
to be a challenge.
They found it energizing.
They were more likely
to redouble their efforts.
What's going on?
Well, at the fifth grade level,
girls routinely outperform boys
in every subject,
including math and science,
so it's not a question of ability.
The difference is in how boys
and girls approach a challenge.
And it doesn't just end in fifth grade.
An HP report found
that men will apply for a job
if they meet only 60 percent
of the qualifications,
but women, women will apply
only if they meet 100 percent
of the qualifications.
100 percent.
This study is usually invoked
as evidence that, well,
women need a little more confidence.
But I think it's evidence
that women have been socialized
to aspire to perfection,
and they're overly cautious.
(Applause)
And even when we're ambitious,
even when we're leaning in,
that socialization of perfection
has caused us to take
less risks in our careers.
And so those 600,000 jobs
that are open right now
in computing and tech,
women are being left behind,
and it means our economy
is being left behind
on all the innovation and problems
women would solve
if they were socialized to be brave
instead of socialized to be perfect.
(Applause)
So in 2012, I started a company
to teach girls to code,
and what I found
is that by teaching them to code
I had socialized them to be brave.
Coding, it's an endless process
of trial and error,
of trying to get the right command
in the right place,
with sometimes just a semicolon
making the difference
between success and failure.
Code breaks and then it falls apart,
and it often takes many, many tries
until that magical moment
when what you're trying
to build comes to life.
It requires perseverance.
It requires imperfection.
We immediately see in our program
our girls' fear of not getting it right,
of not being perfect.
Every Girls Who Code teacher
tells me the same story.
During the first week,
when the girls are learning how to code,
a student will call her over
and she'll say,
"I don't know what code to write."
The teacher will look at her screen,
and she'll see a blank text editor.
If she didn't know any better,
she'd think that her student
spent the past 20 minutes
just staring at the screen.
But if she presses undo a few times,
she'll see that her student
wrote code and then deleted it.
She tried, she came close,
but she didn't get it exactly right.
Instead of showing
the progress that she made,
she'd rather show nothing at all.
Perfection or bust.
It turns out that our girls
are really good at coding,
but it's not enough
just to teach them to code.
My friend Lev Brie, who is a professor
at the University of Columbia
and teaches intro to Java
tells me about his office hours
with computer science students.
When the guys are struggling
with an assignment,
they'll come in and they'll say,
"Professor, there's something
wrong with my code."
The girls will come in and say,
"Professor, there's something
wrong with me."
We have to begin to undo
the socialization of perfection,
but we've got to combine it
with building a sisterhood
that lets girls know
that they are not alone.
Because trying harder
is not going to fix a broken system.
I can't tell you how many women tell me,
"I'm afraid to raise my hand,
I'm afraid to ask a question,
because I don't want to be the only one
who doesn't understand,
the only one who is struggling.
When we teach girls to be brave
and we have a supportive network
cheering them on,
they will build incredible things,
and I see this every day.
Take, for instance,
two of our high school students
who built a game called Tampon Run --
yes, Tampon Run --
to fight against the menstruation taboo
and sexism in gaming.
Or the Syrian refugee
who dared show her love
for her new country
by building an app
to help Americans get to the polls.
Or a 16-year-old girl
who built an algorithm
to help detect whether a cancer
is benign or malignant
in the off chance
that she can save her daddy's life
because he has cancer.
These are just
three examples of thousands,
thousands of girls who have been
socialized to be imperfect,
who have learned to keep trying,
who have learned perseverance.
And whether they become coders
or the next Hillary Clinton or Beyoncé,
they will not defer their dreams.
And those dreams have never been
more important for our country.
For the American economy,
for any economy to grow,
to truly innovate,
we cannot leave behind
half our population.
We have to socialize our girls
to be comfortable with imperfection,
and we've got to do it now.
We cannot wait for them
to learn how to be brave like I did
when I was 33 years old.
We have to teach them
to be brave in schools
and early in their careers,
when it has the most potential
to impact their lives
and the lives of others,
and we have to show them
that they will be loved and accepted
not for being perfect
but for being courageous.
And so I need each of you
to tell every young woman you know --
your sister, your niece,
your employee, your colleague --
to be comfortable with imperfection,
because when we teach
girls to be imperfect,
and we help them leverage it,
we will build a movement
of young women who are brave
and who will build
a better world for themselves
and for each and every one of us.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: Reshma, thank you.
It's such a powerful vision you have.
You have a vision.
Tell me how it's going.
How many girls
are involved now in your program?
Reshma Saujani: Yeah.
So in 2012, we taught 20 girls.
This year we'll teach 40,000
in all 50 states.
(Applause)
And that number is really powerful,
because last year we only graduated
7,500 women in computer science.
Like, the problem is so bad
that we can make
that type of change quickly.
CA: And you're working with some
of the companies in this room even,
who are welcoming
graduates from your program?
RS: Yeah, we have about 80 partners,
from Twitter to Facebook
to Adobe to IBM to Microsoft
to Pixar to Disney,
I mean, every single company out there.
And if you're not signed up,
I'm going to find you,
because we need every single tech company
to embed a Girls Who Code
classroom in their office.
CA: And you have some stories
back from some of those companies
that when you mix in more gender balance
in the engineering teams,
good things happen.
RS: Great things happen.
I mean, I think that it's crazy to me
to think about the fact
that right now 85 percent of all
consumer purchases are made by women.
Women use social media at a rate
of 600 percent more than men.
We own the Internet,
and we should be building
the companies of tomorrow.
And I think when companies
have diverse teams,
and they have incredible women
that are part of their engineering teams,
they build awesome things,
and we see it every day.
CA: Reshma, you saw the reaction there.
You're doing incredibly important work.
This whole community is cheering you on.
More power to you. Thank you.
RS: Thank you.
(Applause)
When I was a child, I always
wanted to be a superhero.
I wanted to save the world
and make everyone happy.
But I knew that I'd need superpowers
to make my dreams come true.
So I used to embark
on these imaginary journeys
to find intergalactic objects
from planet Krypton,
which was a lot of fun,
but didn't yield much result.
When I grew up and realized
that science fiction was not
a good source for superpowers,
I decided instead to embark
on a journey of real science,
to find a more useful truth.
I started my journey in California,
with a UC Berkeley
30-year longitudinal study
that examined the photos
of students in an old yearbook,
and tried to measure their success
and well-being throughout their life.
By measuring the students' smiles,
researchers were able to predict
how fulfilling and long-lasting
a subject's marriage would be,
(Laughter)
how well she would score
on standardized tests of well-being,
and how inspiring she would be to others.
In another yearbook, I stumbled
upon Barry Obama's picture.
When I first saw his picture,
I thought that his superpowers
came from his super collar.
(Laughter)
But now I know it was all in his smile.
Another aha! moment came from a 2010
Wayne State University research project
that looked into pre-1950s
baseball cards of Major League players.
The researchers found
that the span of a player's smile
could actually predict
the span of his life.
Players who didn't smile in their pictures
lived an average of only 72.9 years,
where players with beaming smiles
lived an average of almost 80 years.
(Laughter)
The good news is that
we're actually born smiling.
Using 3D ultrasound technology,
we can now see that developing
babies appear to smile,
even in the womb.
When they're born,
babies continue to smile --
initially, mostly in their sleep.
And even blind babies smile
to the sound of the human voice.
Smiling is one of the most basic,
biologically uniform
expressions of all humans.
In studies conducted in Papua New Guinea,
Paul Ekman, the world's most renowned
researcher on facial expressions,
found that even members of the Fore tribe,
who were completely disconnected
from Western culture,
and also known for their
unusual cannibalism rituals,
(Laughter)
attributed smiles
to descriptions of situations
the same way you and I would.
So from Papua New Guinea
to Hollywood
all the way to modern art in Beijing,
we smile often,
and use smiles to express
joy and satisfaction.
How many people here in this room
smile more than 20 times per day?
Raise your hand if you do.
Oh, wow.
Outside of this room,
more than a third of us smile
more than 20 times per day,
whereas less than 14 percent of us
smile less than five.
In fact, those with the most amazing
superpowers are actually children,
who smile as many as 400 times per day.
Have you ever wondered
why being around children,
who smile so frequently,
makes you smile very often?
A recent study
at Uppsala University in Sweden
found that it's very difficult to frown
when looking at someone who smiles.
You ask why?
Because smiling
is evolutionarily contagious,
and it suppresses the control
we usually have on our facial muscles.
Mimicking a smile
and experiencing it physically
helps us understand whether
our smile is fake or real,
so we can understand
the emotional state of the smiler.
In a recent mimicking study
at the University
of Clermont-Ferrand in France,
subjects were asked to determine
whether a smile was real or fake
while holding a pencil in their mouth
to repress smiling muscles.
Without the pencil,
subjects were excellent judges,
but with the pencil in their mouth --
when they could not mimic
the smile they saw --
their judgment was impaired.
(Laughter)
In addition to theorizing on evolution
in "The Origin of Species,"
Charles Darwin also wrote
the facial feedback response theory.
His theory states that the act of smiling
itself actually makes us feel better,
rather than smiling being
merely a result of feeling good.
In his study, Darwin actually cited
a French neurologist, Guillaume Duchenne,
who sent electric jolts to facial muscles
to induce and stimulate smiles.
Please, don't try this at home.
(Laughter)
In a related German study,
researchers used fMRI imaging
to measure brain activity
before and after injecting Botox
to suppress smiling muscles.
The finding supported Darwin's theory,
by showing that facial feedback
modifies the neural processing
of emotional content in the brain,
in a way that helps us
feel better when we smile.
Smiling stimulates
our brain reward mechanism
in a way that even chocolate --
a well-regarded pleasure inducer --
cannot match.
British researchers found that one smile
can generate the same level
of brain stimulation
as up to 2,000 bars of chocolate.
(Laughter)
Wait --
The same study found
that smiling is as stimulating
as receiving up to 16,000
pounds sterling in cash.
(Laughter)
That's like 25 grand a smile.
It's not bad.
And think about it this way:
25,000 times 400 --
quite a few kids out there feel
like Mark Zuckerberg every day.
(Laughter)
And unlike lots of chocolate,
lots of smiling can actually
make you healthier.
Smiling can help reduce the level
of stress-enhancing hormones
like cortisol, adrenaline and dopamine,
increase the level of mood-enhancing
hormones like endorphins,
and reduce overall blood pressure.
And if that's not enough,
smiling can actually make you
look good in the eyes of others.
A recent study at Penn State University
found that when you smile,
you don't only appear to be
more likable and courteous,
but you actually appear
to be more competent.
So whenever you want
to look great and competent,
reduce your stress
or improve your marriage,
or feel as if you just had a whole stack
of high-quality chocolate
without incurring the caloric cost,
or as if you found 25 grand in a pocket
of an old jacket you hadn't worn for ages,
or whenever you want
to tap into a superpower
that will help you and everyone around you
live a longer, healthier, happier life,
smile.
(Applause)
Before I get to bulk
of what I have to say,
I feel compelled just to mention
a couple of things about myself.
I am not some mystical,
spiritual sort of person.
I'm a science writer.
I studied physics in college.
I used to be a science
correspondent for NPR.
OK, that said:
in the course of working
on a story for NPR,
I got some advice from an astronomer
that challenged my outlook,
and frankly, changed my life.
You see, the story was about an eclipse,
a partial solar eclipse
that was set to cross the country
in May of 1994.
And the astronomer -- I interviewed him,
and he explained what was going to happen
and how to view it,
but he emphasized that, as interesting
as a partial solar eclipse is,
a much rarer total solar eclipse
is completely different.
In a total eclipse,
for all of two or three minutes,
the moon completely blocks
the face of the sun,
creating what he described
as the most awe-inspiring spectacle
in all of nature.
And so the advice he gave me was this:
"Before you die," he said,
"you owe it to yourself
to experience a total solar eclipse."
Well honestly,
I felt a little uncomfortable
hearing that from someone
I didn't know very well;
it felt sort of intimate.
But it got my attention,
and so I did some research.
Now the thing about total eclipses is,
if you wait for one to come to you,
you're going to be waiting a long time.
Any given point on earth
experiences a total eclipse
about once every 400 years.
But if you're willing to travel,
you don't have to wait that long.
And so I learned
that a few years later, in 1998,
a total eclipse was going
to cross the Caribbean.
Now, a total eclipse is visible
only along a narrow path,
about a hundred miles wide,
and that's where the moon's shadow falls.
It's called the "path of totality."
And in February 1998,
the path of totality
was going to cross Aruba.
So I talked to my husband,
and we thought: February? Aruba?
Sounded like a good idea anyway.
(Laughter)
So we headed south,
to enjoy the sun
and to see what would happen
when the sun briefly went away.
Well, the day of the eclipse
found us and many other people
out behind the Hyatt Regency,
on the beach,
waiting for the show to begin.
And we wore eclipse glasses
with cardboard frames
and really dark lenses that enabled us
to look at the sun safely.
A total eclipse begins
as a partial eclipse,
as the moon very slowly makes its way
in front of the sun.
So first it looked the sun
had a little notch in its edge,
and then that notch grew
larger and larger,
turning the sun into a crescent.
And it was all very interesting,
but I wouldn't say it was spectacular.
I mean, the day remained bright.
If I hadn't known
what was going on overhead,
I wouldn't have noticed anything unusual.
Well, about 10 minutes before
the total solar eclipse was set to begin,
weird things started to happen.
A cool wind kicked up.
Daylight looked odd,
and shadows became very strange;
they looked bizarrely sharp,
as if someone had turned up
the contrast knob on the TV.
Then I looked offshore,
and I noticed running lights on boats,
so clearly it was getting dark,
although I hadn't realized it.
Well soon, it was obvious
it was getting dark.
It felt like my eyesight was failing.
And then all of a sudden,
the lights went out.
Well, at that,
a cheer erupted from the beach,
and I took off my eclipse glasses,
because at this point
during the total eclipse,
it was safe to look at the sun
with the naked eye.
And I glanced upward,
and I was just dumbstruck.
Now, consider that, at this point,
I was in my mid-30s.
I had lived on earth long enough
to know what the sky looks like.
I mean --
(Laughter)
I'd seen blue skies and grey skies
and starry skies and angry skies
and pink skies at sunrise.
But here was a sky I had never seen.
First, there were the colors.
Up above, it was a deep purple-grey,
like twilight.
But on the horizon it was orange,
like sunset,
360 degrees.
And up above, in the twilight,
bright stars and planets had come out.
So there was Jupiter
and there was Mercury
and there was Venus.
They were all in a line.
And there, along this line,
was this thing,
this glorious, bewildering thing.
It looked like a wreath
woven from silvery thread,
and it just hung out there
in space, shimmering.
That was the sun's outer atmosphere,
the solar corona.
And pictures just don't do it justice.
It's not just a ring or halo
around the sun;
it's finely textured,
like it's made out of strands of silk.
And although it looked
nothing like our sun,
of course, I knew that's what it was.
So there was the sun,
and there were the planets,
and I could see how the planets
revolve around the sun.
It's like I had left our solar system
and was standing on some alien world,
looking back at creation.
And for the first time in my life,
I just felt viscerally connected
to the universe
in all of its immensity.
Time stopped,
or it just kind of felt nonexistent,
and what I beheld with my eyes --
I didn't just see it,
it felt like a vision.
And I stood there in this nirvana
for all of 174 seconds --
less than three minutes --
when all of a sudden, it was over.
The sun burst out,
the blue sky returned,
the stars and the planets
and the corona were gone.
The world returned to normal.
But I had changed.
And that's how I became an umbraphile --
an eclipse chaser.
(Laughter)
So, this is how I spend my time
and hard-earned money.
Every couple of years, I head off
to wherever the moon's shadow will fall
to experience another couple minutes
of cosmic bliss,
and to share the experience with others:
with friends in Australia,
with an entire city in Germany.
In 1999, in Munich,
I joined hundreds of thousands
who filled the streets and the rooftops
and cheered in unison
as the solar corona emerged.
And over time, I've become something else:
an eclipse evangelist.
I see it as my job
to pay forward the advice
that I received all those years ago.
And so let me tell you:
before you die,
you owe it to yourself
to experience a total solar eclipse.
It is the ultimate experience of awe.
Now, that word, "awesome,"
has grown so overused
that it's lost its original meaning.
True awe, a sense of wonder
and insignificance
in the face of something
enormous and grand,
is rare in our lives.
But when you experience it, it's powerful.
Awe dissolves the ego.
It makes us feel connected.
Indeed, it promotes
empathy and generosity.
Well, there is nothing truly more awesome
than a total solar eclipse.
Unfortunately, few Americans
have seen one,
because it's been 38 years
since one last touched
the continental United States
and 99 years since one last crossed
the breadth of the nation.
But that is about to change.
Over the next 35 years,
five total solar eclipses will visit
the continental United States,
and three of them
will be especially grand.
Six weeks from now, on August 21, 2017 --
(Applause)
the moon's shadow will race
from Oregon to South Carolina.
April 8, 2024, the moon's shadow
heads north from Texas to Maine.
In 2045, on August 12,
the path cuts from California to Florida.
I say:
What if we made these holidays?
What if we --
(Laughter)
(Applause)
What if we all stood together,
as many people as possible,
in the shadow of the moon?
Just maybe, this shared experience of awe
would help heal our divisions,
get us to treat each other
just a bit more humanely.
Now, admittedly, some folks consider
my evangelizing a little out there;
my obsession, eccentric.
I mean, why focus so much attention
on something so brief?
Why cross the globe --
or state lines, for that matter --
for something that lasts three minutes?
As I said:
I am not a spiritual person.
I don't believe in God.
I wish I did.
But when I think of my own mortality --
and I do, a lot --
when I think of everyone I have lost,
my mother in particular,
what soothes me
is that moment of awe I had in Aruba.
I picture myself on that beach,
looking at that sky,
and I remember how I felt.
My existence may be temporary,
but that's OK because, my gosh,
look at what I'm a part of.
And so this is a lesson I've learned,
and it's one that applies
to life in general:
duration of experience
does not equal impact.
One weekend, one conversation --
hell, one glance --
can change everything.
Cherish those moments
of deep connection with other people,
with the natural world,
and make them a priority.
Yes, I chase eclipses.
You might chase something else.
But it's not about the 174 seconds.
It's about how they change
the years that come after.
Thank you.
(Applause)
(Mechanical noises)
(Music)
(Applause)
I'm a designer and an educator.
I'm a multitasking person, and I push my students
to fly through a very creative, multitasking design process.
But how efficient is, really, this multitasking?
Let's consider for a while the option of monotasking.
A couple of examples.
Look at that.
This is my multitasking activity result. (Laughter)
So trying to cook, answering the phone, writing SMS,
and maybe uploading some pictures
about this awesome barbecue.
So someone tells us the story about supertaskers,
so this two percent of people who are able
to control multitasking environment.
But what about ourselves, and what about our reality?
When's the last time you really enjoyed
just the voice of your friend?
So this is a project I'm working on,
and this is a series of front covers
to downgrade our super, hyper —
(Laughter) (Applause)
to downgrade our super, hyper-mobile phones
into the essence of their function.
Another example: Have you ever been to Venice?
How beautiful it is to lose ourselves in these little streets
on the island.
But our multitasking reality is pretty different,
and full of tons of information.
So what about something like that
to rediscover our sense of adventure?
I know that it could sound pretty weird to speak about mono
when the number of possibilities is so huge,
but I push you to consider the option of
focusing on just one task,
or maybe turning your digital senses totally off.
So nowadays, everyone could produce his mono product.
Why not? So find your monotask spot
within the multitasking world.
Thank you.
(Applause)
(Laughter)
I was afraid of womanhood.
Not that I'm not afraid now,
but I've learned to pretend.
I've learned to be flexible.
In fact, I've developed some interesting tools
to help me deal with this fear.
Let me explain.
Back in the '50s and '60s, when I was growing up,
little girls were supposed to be kind and thoughtful
and pretty and gentle and soft,
and we were supposed to fit into roles
that were sort of shadowy --
really not quite clear what we were supposed to be.
(Laughter)
There were plenty of role models all around us.
We had our mothers, our aunts, our cousins, our sisters,
and of course, the ever-present media
bombarding us with images and words,
telling us how to be.
Now my mother was different.
She was a homemaker,
but she and I didn't go out and do girlie things together,
and she didn't buy me pink outfits.
Instead, she knew what I needed, and she bought me a book of cartoons.
And I just ate it up.
I drew, and I drew,
and since I knew that humor was acceptable in my family,
I could draw, do what I wanted to do,
and not have to perform, not have to speak --
I was very shy --
and I could still get approval.
I was launched as a cartoonist.
Now when we're young,
we don't always know. We know there are rules out there,
but we don't always know --
we don't perform them right,
even though we are imprinted at birth
with these things,
and we're told
what the most important color in the world is.
We're told what shape we're supposed to be in.
(Laughter)
We're told what to wear --
(Laughter)
-- and how to do our hair --
(Laughter)
-- and how to behave.
Now the rules that I'm talking about
are constantly being monitored by the culture.
We're being corrected,
and the primary policemen are women,
because we are the carriers of the tradition.
We pass it down from generation to generation.
Not only that --
we always have this vague notion
that something's expected of us.
And on top of all off these rules,
they keep changing.
(Laughter)
We don't know what's going on half the time,
so it puts us in a very tenuous position.
(Laughter)
Now if you don't like these rules,
and many of us don't --
I know I didn't, and I still don't,
even though I follow them half the time,
not quite aware that I'm following them --
what better way than to change them [than] with humor?
Humor relies on the traditions of a society.
It takes what we know, and it twists it.
It takes the codes of behavior and the codes of dress,
and it makes it unexpected,
and that's what elicits a laugh.
Now what if you put together women and humor?
I think you can get change.
Because women are on the ground floor,
and we know the traditions so well,
we can bring a different voice to the table.
Now I started drawing
in the middle of a lot of chaos.
I grew up not far from here in Washington D.C.
during the Civil Rights movement, the assassinations,
the Watergate hearings and then the feminist movement,
and I think I was drawing,
trying to figure out what was going on.
And then also my family was in chaos,
and I drew to try to bring my family together --
(Laughter)
-- try to bring my family together with laughter.
It didn't work.
My parents got divorced, and my sister was arrested.
But I found my place.
I found that I didn't have to wear high heels,
I didn't have to wear pink,
and I could feel like I fit in.
Now when I was a little older, in my 20s,
I realized there are not many women in cartooning.
And I thought, "Well, maybe I can break
the little glass ceiling of cartooning,"
and so I did. I became a cartoonist.
And then I thought -- in my 40s I started thinking,
"Well, why don't I do something?
I always loved political cartoons,
so why don't I do something with the content of my cartoons
to make people think about the stupid rules that we're following
as well as laugh?"
Now my perspective
is a particularly --
(Laughter)
-- my perspective is a particularly American perspective.
I can't help it. I live here.
Even though I've traveled a lot,
I still think like an American woman.
But I believe that the rules that I'm talking about
are universal, of course --
that each culture has its different codes of behavior
and dress and traditions,
and each woman has to deal with these same things
that we do here in the U.S.
Consequently, we have.
Women, because we're on the ground, we know the tradition.
We have amazing antennae.
Now my work lately
has been to collaborate with international cartoonists,
which I so enjoy,
and it's given me a greater appreciation
for the power of cartoons
to get at the truth,
to get at the issues quickly and succinctly.
And not only that, it can get to the viewer
through not only the intellect, but through the heart.
My work also has allowed me to collaborate
with women cartoonists from across the world --
countries such as Saudi Arabia,
Iran, Turkey,
Argentina, France --
and we have sat together and laughed
and talked and shared our difficulties.
And these women are working so hard to get their voices heard
in some very difficult circumstances.
But I feel blessed to be able to work with them.
And we talk about
how women have such strong perceptions,
because of our tenuous position
and our role as tradition-keepers,
that we can have the great potential
to be change-agents.
And I think, I truly believe,
that we can change this thing
one laugh at a time.
Thank you.
(Applause)
I have given the slide show that I gave here two years ago about 2,000 times.
I'm giving a short slide show this morning
that I'm giving for the very first time, so --
well it's -- I don't want or need to raise the bar,
I'm actually trying to lower the bar.
Because I've cobbled this together
to try to meet the challenge of this session.
And I was reminded by Karen Armstrong's fantastic presentation
that religion really properly understood
is not about belief, but about behavior.
Perhaps we should say the same thing about optimism.
How dare we be optimistic?
Optimism is sometimes characterized as a belief, an intellectual posture.
As Mahatma Gandhi famously said,
"You must become the change you wish to see in the world."
And the outcome about which
we wish to be optimistic is not going to be created
by the belief alone, except to the extent that the belief
brings about new behavior. But the word "behavior"
is also, I think, sometimes misunderstood in this context.
I'm a big advocate of changing
the lightbulbs and buying hybrids,
and Tipper and I put 33 solar panels on our house,
and dug the geothermal wells, and did all of that other stuff.
But, as important as it is to change the lightbulbs,
it is more important to change the laws.
And when we change our behavior in our daily lives,
we sometimes leave out the citizenship part
and the democracy part. In order to be optimistic about this,
we have to become incredibly active as citizens in our democracy.
In order to solve the climate crisis,
we have to solve the democracy crisis.
And we have one.
I have been trying to tell this story for a long time.
I was reminded of that recently, by a woman
who walked past the table I was sitting at,
just staring at me as she walked past. She was in her 70s,
looked like she had a kind face. I thought nothing of it
until I saw from the corner of my eye
she was walking from the opposite direction,
also just staring at me. And so I said, "How do you do?"
And she said, "You know, if you dyed your hair black,
you would look just like Al Gore." (Laughter)
Many years ago, when I was a young congressman,
I spent an awful lot of time dealing with the challenge
of nuclear arms control -- the nuclear arms race.
And the military historians taught me,
during that quest, that military conflicts are typically
put into three categories: local battles,
regional or theater wars, and the rare but all-important
global, world war -- strategic conflicts.
And each level of conflict requires a different allocation of resources,
a different approach,
a different organizational model.
Environmental challenges fall into the same three categories,
and most of what we think about
are local environmental problems: air pollution, water pollution,
hazardous waste dumps. But there are also
regional environmental problems, like acid rain
from the Midwest to the Northeast, and from Western Europe
to the Arctic, and from the Midwest
out the Mississippi into the dead zone of the Gulf of Mexico.
And there are lots of those. But the climate crisis
is the rare but all-important
global, or strategic, conflict.
Everything is affected. And we have to organize our response
appropriately. We need a worldwide, global mobilization
for renewable energy, conservation, efficiency
and a global transition to a low-carbon economy.
We have work to do. And we can mobilize resources
and political will. But the political will
has to be mobilized, in order to mobilize the resources.
Let me show you these slides here.
I thought I would start with the logo. What's missing here,
of course, is the North Polar ice cap.
Greenland remains. Twenty-eight years ago, this is what the
polar ice cap -- the North Polar ice cap -- looked like
at the end of the summer, at the fall equinox.
This last fall, I went to the Snow and Ice Data Center
in Boulder, Colorado, and talked to the researchers
here in Monterey at the Naval Postgraduate Laboratory.
This is what's happened in the last 28 years.
To put it in perspective, 2005 was the previous record.
Here's what happened last fall
that has really unnerved the researchers.
The North Polar ice cap is the same size geographically --
doesn't look quite the same size --
but it is exactly the same size as the United States,
minus an area roughly equal to the state of Arizona.
The amount that disappeared in 2005
was equivalent to everything east of the Mississippi.
The extra amount that disappeared last fall
was equivalent to this much. It comes back in the winter,
but not as permanent ice, as thin ice --
vulnerable. The amount remaining could be completely gone
in summer in as little as five years.
That puts a lot of pressure on Greenland.
Already, around the Arctic Circle --
this is a famous village in Alaska. This is a town
in Newfoundland. Antarctica. Latest studies from NASA.
The amount of a moderate-to-severe snow melting
of an area equivalent to the size of California.
"They were the best of times,
they were the worst of times": the most famous opening sentence
in English literature. I want to share briefly
a tale of two planets. Earth and Venus
are exactly the same size. Earth's diameter
is about 400 kilometers larger, but essentially the same size.
They have exactly the same amount of carbon.
But the difference is, on Earth, most of the carbon
has been leeched over time out of the atmosphere,
deposited in the ground as coal, oil,
natural gas, etc. On Venus, most of it
is in the atmosphere. The difference is that our temperature
is 59 degrees on average. On Venus,
it's 855. This is relevant to our current strategy
of taking as much carbon out of the ground as quickly as possible,
and putting it into the atmosphere.
It's not because Venus is slightly closer to the Sun.
It's three times hotter than Mercury,
which is right next to the Sun. Now, briefly,
here's an image you've seen, as one of the only old images,
but I show it because I want to briefly give you CSI: Climate.
The global scientific community says:
man-made global warming pollution, put into the atmosphere,
thickening this, is trapping more of the outgoing infrared.
You all know that. At the last
IPCC summary, the scientists wanted to say,
"How certain are you?" They wanted to answer that "99 percent."
The Chinese objected, and so the compromise was
"more than 90 percent."
Now, the skeptics say, "Oh, wait a minute,
this could be variations in this energy
coming in from the sun." If that were true,
the stratosphere would be heated as well as the
lower atmosphere, if it's more coming in.
If it's more being trapped on the way out, then you would
expect it to be warmer here and cooler here. Here is the lower atmosphere.
Here's the stratosphere: cooler.
CSI: Climate.
Now, here's the good news. Sixty-eight percent of Americans now believe
that human activity is responsible
for global warming. Sixty-nine percent believe that the Earth is heating up
in a significant way. There has been progress,
but here is the key: when given a list
of challenges to confront, global warming is still listed at near the bottom.
What is missing is a sense of urgency.
If you agree with the factual analysis,
but you don't feel the sense of urgency,
where does that leave you?
Well, the Alliance for Climate Protection, which I head
in conjunction with Current TV -- who did this pro bono --
did a worldwide contest to do commercials on how to communicate this.
This is the winner.
NBC -- I'll show all of the networks here -- the top journalists
for NBC asked 956 questions in 2007
of the presidential candidates: two of them were about
the climate crisis. ABC: 844 questions, two about the climate crisis.
Fox: two. CNN: two. CBS: zero.
From laughs to tears -- this is one of the older
tobacco commercials.
So here's what we're doing.
This is gasoline consumption in all of these countries. And us.
But it's not just the developed nations.
The developing countries are now following us
and accelerating their pace. And actually,
their cumulative emissions this year are the equivalent
to where we were in 1965. And they're catching up
very dramatically. The total concentrations:
by 2025, they will be essentially where we were in 1985.
If the wealthy countries were completely missing
from the picture, we would still have this crisis.
But we have given to the developing countries
the technologies and the ways of thinking
that are creating the crisis. This is in Bolivia --
over thirty years.
This is peak fishing in a few seconds. The '60s.
'70s. '80s. '90s. We have to stop this. And the good news is that we can.
We have the technologies.
We have to have a unified view of how to go about this:
the struggle against poverty in the world
and the challenge of cutting wealthy country emissions,
all has a single, very simple solution.
People say, "What's the solution?" Here it is.
Put a price on carbon. We need a CO2 tax, revenue neutral,
to replace taxation on employment, which was invented by Bismarck --
and some things have changed
since the 19th century.
In the poor world, we have to integrate the responses
to poverty with the solutions to the climate crisis.
Plans to fight poverty in Uganda
are mooted, if we do not solve the climate crisis.
But responses can actually make a huge difference
in the poor countries. This is a proposal
that has been talked about a lot in Europe.
This was from Nature magazine. These are concentrating
solar, renewable energy plants, linked in a so-called "supergrid"
to supply all of the electrical power
to Europe, largely from developing countries -- high-voltage DC currents.
This is not pie in the sky; this can be done.
We need to do it for our own economy.
The latest figures show that the old model
is not working. There are a lot of great investments
that you can make. If you are investing in tar sands
or shale oil, then you have a portfolio
that is crammed with sub-prime carbon assets.
And it is based on an old model.
Junkies find veins in their toes when the ones
in their arms and their legs collapse. Developing tar sands
and coal shale is the equivalent. Here are just a few of the investments
that I personally think make sense.
I have a stake in these, so I'll have a disclaimer there.
But geothermal, concentrating solar,
advanced photovoltaics, efficiency and conservation.
You've seen this slide before, but there's a change.
The only two countries that didn't ratify
-- and now there's only one. Australia had an election.
And there was a campaign in Australia
that involved television and Internet and radio commercials
to lift the sense of urgency for the people there.
And we trained 250 people to give the slide show
in every town and village and city in Australia.
Lot of other things contributed to it,
but the new Prime Minister announced that
his very first priority would be to change Australia's position
on Kyoto, and he has. Now, they came to an awareness
partly because of the horrible drought that they have had.
This is Lake Lanier. My friend Heidi Cullen
said that if we gave droughts names the way we give hurricanes names,
we'd call the one in the southeast now Katrina,
and we would say it's headed toward Atlanta.
We can't wait for the kind of drought
Australia had to change our political culture.
Here's more good news. The cities supporting Kyoto in the U.S.
are up to 780 -- and I thought I saw one go by there,
just to localize this -- which is good news.
Now, to close, we heard a couple of days ago
about the value of making individual heroism so commonplace
that it becomes banal or routine.
What we need is another hero generation. Those of us who are alive
in the United States of America
today especially, but also the rest of the world,
have to somehow understand that history
has presented us with a choice -- just as Jill [Bolte] Taylor was figuring out
how to save her life while she was distracted
by the amazing experience that she was going through.
We now have a culture of distraction.
But we have a planetary emergency.
And we have to find a way to create,
in the generation of those alive today, a sense of generational mission.
I wish I could find the words to convey this.
This was another hero generation
that brought democracy to the planet.
Another that ended slavery. And that gave women the right to vote.
We can do this. Don't tell me that we don't have the capacity to do it.
If we had just one week's worth of what we spend on the Iraq War,
we could be well on the way to solving this challenge.
We have the capacity to do it.
One final point: I'm optimistic, because I believe
we have the capacity, at moments of great challenge,
to set aside the causes of distraction and rise to the challenge
that history is presenting to us.
Sometimes I hear people respond to the disturbing facts of the climate crisis
by saying, "Oh, this is so terrible.
What a burden we have." I would like to ask you
to reframe that. How many generations
in all of human history have had the opportunity
to rise to a challenge that is worthy of our best efforts?
A challenge that can pull from us
more than we knew we could do? I think we ought to approach
this challenge with a sense of profound joy
and gratitude that we are the generation
about which, a thousand years from now,
philharmonic orchestras and poets and singers will celebrate
by saying, they were the ones that found it within themselves
to solve this crisis and lay the basis
for a bright and optimistic human future.
Let's do that. Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: For so many people at TED, there is deep pain
that basically a design issue
on a voting form --
one bad design issue meant that your voice wasn't being heard
like that in the last eight years in a position
where you could make these things come true.
That hurts.
Al Gore: You have no idea. (Laughter)
CA: When you look at what the leading candidates
in your own party are doing now -- I mean, there's --
are you excited by their plans on global warming?
AG: The answer to the question is hard for me
because, on the one hand, I think that
we should feel really great about the fact
that the Republican nominee -- certain nominee --
John McCain, and both of the finalists
for the Democratic nomination -- all three have a very different
and forward-leaning position
on the climate crisis. All three have offered leadership,
and all three are very different from the approach taken
by the current administration. And I think
that all three have also been responsible in
putting forward plans and proposals. But the campaign dialogue that --
as illustrated by the questions --
that was put together by the
League of Conservation Voters, by the way, the analysis of all the questions --
and, by the way, the debates have all been
sponsored by something that goes by the Orwellian label,
"Clean Coal." Has anybody noticed that?
Every single debate has been sponsored by "Clean Coal."
"Now, even lower emissions!"
The richness and fullness of the dialogue
in our democracy has not laid the basis
for the kind of bold initiative that is really needed.
So they're saying the right things and they may --
whichever of them is elected -- may do the right thing,
but let me tell you: when I came back from Kyoto
in 1997, with a feeling of great happiness
that we'd gotten that breakthrough there,
and then confronted the United States Senate,
only one out of 100 senators was willing to vote
to confirm, to ratify that treaty. Whatever the candidates say
has to be laid alongside what the people say.
This challenge is part of the fabric
of our whole civilization.
CO2 is the exhaling breath of our civilization, literally.
And now we mechanized that process. Changing that pattern
requires a scope, a scale, a speed of change
that is beyond what we have done in the past.
So that's why I began by saying,
be optimistic in what you do, but be an active citizen.
Demand -- change the light bulbs,
but change the laws. Change the global treaties.
We have to speak up. We have to solve this democracy -- this --
We have sclerosis in our democracy. And we have to change that.
Use the Internet. Go on the Internet.
Connect with people. Become very active as citizens.
Have a moratorium -- we shouldn't
have any new coal-fired generating plants
that aren't able to capture and store CO2, which means we have to
quickly build these renewable sources.
Now, nobody is talking on that scale. But I do believe
that between now and November, it is possible.
This Alliance for Climate Protection
is going to launch a nationwide campaign --
grassroots mobilization, television ads, Internet ads,
radio, newspaper -- with partnerships with everybody
from the Girl Scouts to the hunters and fishermen.
We need help. We need help.
CA: In terms of your own personal role going forward,
Al, is there something more than that
you would like to be doing?
AG: I have prayed that I would be able to find the answer
to that question. What can I do?
Buckminster Fuller once wrote, "If the future
of all human civilization depended on me, what would I do?
How would I be?" It does depend on all of us,
but again, not just with the light bulbs.
We, most of us here, are Americans. We have a democracy.
We can change things, but we have to actively change.
What's needed really is a higher level of consciousness.
And that's hard to --
that's hard to create -- but it is coming.
There's an old African proverb that some of you know
that says, "If you want to go quickly, go alone;
if you want to go far, go together." We have to go far, quickly.
So we have to have a change in consciousness.
A change in commitment. A new sense of urgency.
A new appreciation for the privilege
that we have of undertaking this challenge.
CA: Al Gore, thank you so much for coming to TED.
AG: Thank you. Thank you very much.
Planetary systems outside our own
are like distant cities whose lights we can see twinkling,
but whose streets we can't walk.
By studying those twinkling lights though,
we can learn about how stars and planets interact
to form their own ecosystem
and make habitats that are amenable to life.
In this image of the Tokyo skyline,
I've hidden data
from the newest planet-hunting space telescope on the block,
the Kepler Mission.
Can you see it?
There we go.
This is just a tiny part of the sky the Kepler stares at,
where it searches for planets
by measuring the light from over 150,000 stars,
all at once, every half hour,
and very precisely.
And what we're looking for
is the tiny dimming of light
that is caused by a planet passing in front of one of these stars
and blocking some of that starlight from getting to us.
In just over two years of operations,
we've found over 1,200
potential new planetary systems around other stars.
To give you some perspective,
in the previous two decades of searching,
we had only known about 400
prior to Kepler.
When we see these little dips in the light,
we can determine a number of things.
For one thing, we can determine that there's a planet there,
but also how big that planet is
and how far it is away from its parent star.
That distance is really important
because it tells us
how much light the planet receives overall.
And that distance and knowing that amount of light is important
because it's a little like you or I sitting around a campfire:
You want to be close enough to the campfire so that you're warm,
but not so close
that you're too toasty and you get burned.
However, there's more to know about your parent star
than just how much light you receive overall.
And I'll tell you why.
This is our star. This is our Sun.
It's shown here in visible light.
That's the light that you can see with your own human eyes.
You'll notice that it looks pretty much
like the iconic yellow ball --
that Sun that we all draw when we're children.
But you'll notice something else,
and that's that the face of the Sun
has freckles.
These freckles are called sunspots,
and they are just one of the manifestations
of the Sun's magnetic field.
They also cause the light from the star to vary.
And we can measure this
very, very precisely with Kepler and trace their effects.
However, these are just the tip of the iceberg.
If we had UV eyes or X-ray eyes,
we would really see
the dynamic and dramatic effects
of our Sun's magnetic activity --
the kind of thing that happens on other stars as well.
Just think, even when it's cloudy outside,
these kind of events are happening
in the sky above you all the time.
So when we want to learn whether a planet is habitable,
whether it might be amenable to life,
we want to know not only how much total light it receives
and how warm it is,
but we want to know about its space weather --
this high-energy radiation,
the UV and the X-rays
that are created by its star
and that bathe it in this bath of high-energy radiation.
And so, we can't really look
at planets around other stars
in the same kind of detail
that we can look at planets in our own solar system.
I'm showing here Venus, Earth and Mars --
three planets in our own solar system that are roughly the same size,
but only one of which
is really a good place to live.
But what we can do in the meantime
is measure the light from our stars
and learn about this relationship
between the planets and their parent stars
to suss out clues
about which planets might be good places
to look for life in the universe.
Kepler won't find a planet
around every single star it looks at.
But really, every measurement it makes
is precious,
because it's teaching us about the relationship
between stars and planets,
and how it's really the starlight
that sets the stage
for the formation of life in the universe.
While it's Kepler the telescope, the instrument that stares,
it's we, life, who are searching.
Thank you.
(Applause)
I'm a painter.
I make large-scale figurative paintings,
which means I paint people
like this.
But I'm here tonight to tell you
about something personal
that changed my work and my perspective.
It's something we all go through,
and my hope is that my experience
may be helpful to somebody.
To give you some background on me,
I grew up the youngest of eight.
Yes, eight kids in my family.
I have six older brothers and a sister.
To give you a sense of what that's like,
when my family went on vacation,
we had a bus.
(Laughter)
My supermom would drive us all over town
to our various after-school activities --
not in the bus.
We had a regular car, too.
She would take me to art classes,
and not just one or two.
She took me to every available art class
from when I was eight to 16,
because that's all I wanted to do.
She even took a class with me
in New York City.
Now, being the youngest of eight,
I learned a few survival skills.
Rule number one:
don't let your big brother
see you do anything stupid.
So I learned to be quiet and neat
and careful to follow the rules
and stay in line.
But painting was where I made the rules.
That was my private world.
By 14, I knew I really wanted
to be an artist.
My big plan was to be a waitress
to support my painting.
So I continued honing my skills.
I went to graduate school
and I got an MFA,
and at my first solo show,
my brother asked me,
"What do all these red dots
mean next to the paintings?"
Nobody was more surprised than me.
The red dots meant
that the paintings were sold
and that I'd be able to pay my rent
with painting.
Now, my apartment
had four electrical outlets,
and I couldn't use a microwave
and a toaster at the same time,
but still, I could pay my rent.
So I was very happy.
Here's a painting
from back around that time.
I needed it to be
as realistic as possible.
It had to be specific and believable.
This was the place where I was
isolated and in total control.
Since then, I've made a career
of painting people in water.
Bathtubs and showers were
the perfect enclosed environment.
It was intimate and private,
and water was this complicated challenge
that kept me busy for a decade.
I made about 200 of these paintings,
some of them six to eight feet,
like this one.
For this painting, I mixed flour in
with the bathwater to make it cloudy
and I floated cooking oil on the surface
and stuck a girl in it,
and when I lit it up,
it was so beautiful
I couldn't wait to paint it.
I was driven by this
kind of impulsive curiosity,
always looking for something new to add:
vinyl, steam, glass.
I once put all this Vaseline
in my head and hair
just to see what that would look like.
Don't do that.
(Laughter)
So it was going well.
I was finding my way.
I was eager and motivated
and surrounded by artists,
always going to openings and events.
I was having some success and recognition
and I moved into an apartment
with more than four outlets.
My mom and I would stay up very late
talking about our latest ideas
and inspiring each other.
She made beautiful pottery.
I have a friend named Bo
who made this painting
of his wife and I dancing by the ocean,
and he called it "The Light Years."
I asked him what that meant, and he said,
"Well, that's when you've stepped
into adulthood, you're no longer a child,
but you're not yet weighed down
by the responsibilities of life."
That was it. It was the light years.
On October 8, 2011,
the light years came to an end.
My mom was diagnosed with lung cancer.
It had spread to her bones,
and it was in her brain.
When she told me this, I fell to my knees.
I totally lost it.
And when I got myself together
and I looked at her,
I realized, this isn't about me.
This is about figuring out
how to help her.
My father is a doctor,
and so we had a great advantage
having him in charge,
and he did a beautiful job
taking care of her.
But I, too, wanted to do
everything I could to help,
so I wanted to try everything.
We all did.
I researched alternative medicines,
diets, juicing, acupuncture.
Finally, I asked her,
"Is this what you want me to do?"
And she said, "No."
She said, "Pace yourself.
I'm going to need you later."
She knew what was happening,
and she knew what the doctors
and the experts
and the internet didn't know:
how she wanted to go through this.
I just needed to ask her.
I realized that if I tried to fix it,
I would miss it.
So I just started to be with her,
whatever that meant
and whatever situation came up,
just really listen to her.
If before I was resisting,
then now I was surrendering,
giving up trying to control
the uncontrollable
and just being there in it with her.
Time slowed down,
and the date was irrelevant.
We developed a routine.
Early each morning I would crawl
into bed with her and sleep with her.
My brother would come for breakfast
and we'd be so glad to hear
his car coming up the driveway.
So I'd help her up and take both her hands
and help her walk to the kitchen.
She had this huge mug she made
she loved to drink her coffee out of,
and she loved Irish soda bread
for breakfast.
Afterwards was the shower,
and she loved this part.
She loved the warm water,
so I made this as indulgent as I could,
like a spa.
My sister would help sometimes.
We had warm towels
and slippers ready immediately
so she never got cold for a second.
I'd blow-dry her hair.
My brothers would come in the evenings
and bring their kids,
and that was the highlight of her day.
Over time, we started to use a wheelchair,
and she didn't want to eat so much,
and she used the tiniest little teacup
we could find to drink her coffee.
I couldn't support her myself anymore,
so we hired an aide
to help me with the showers.
These simple daily activities
became our sacred ritual,
and we repeated them day after day
as the cancer grew.
It was humbling and painful
and exactly where I wanted to be.
We called this time "the beautiful awful."
She died on October 26, 2012.
It was a year and three weeks
after her diagnosis.
She was gone.
My brothers, sister, and father and I
all came together in this
supportive and attentive way.
It was as though our whole family dynamic
and all our established roles vanished
and we were just
all together in this unknown,
feeling the same thing
and taking care of each other.
I'm so grateful for them.
As someone who spends most
of my time alone in a studio working,
I had no idea that this kind of connection
could be so important, so healing.
This was the most important thing.
It was what I always wanted.
So after the funeral, it was time
for me to go back to my studio.
So I packed up my car
and I drove back to Brooklyn,
and painting is what I've always done,
so that's what I did.
And here's what happened.
It's like a release of everything
that was unraveling in me.
That safe, very, very carefully
rendered safe place
that I created in all my other paintings,
it was a myth.
It didn't work.
And I was afraid, because
I didn't want to paint anymore.
So I went into the woods.
I thought, I'll try that, going outside.
I got my paints,
and I wasn't a landscape painter,
but I wasn't really
much of any kind of painter at all,
so I had no attachment, no expectation,
which allowed me to be reckless and free.
I actually left one of these wet paintings
outside overnight
next to a light in the woods.
By the morning it was lacquered with bugs.
But I didn't care.
It didn't matter. It didn't matter.
I took all these paintings
back to my studio,
and scraped them, and carved into them,
and poured paint thinner on them,
put more paint on top, drew on them.
I had no plan,
but I was watching what was happening.
This is the one with all the bugs in it.
I wasn't trying to represent a real space.
It was the chaos and the imperfections
that were fascinating me,
and something started to happen.
I got curious again.
This is another one from the woods.
There was a caveat now, though.
I couldn't be controlling
the paint like I used to.
It had to be about implying
and suggesting,
not explaining or describing.
And that imperfect,
chaotic, turbulent surface
is what told the story.
I started to be as curious
as I was when I was a student.
So the next thing was I wanted
to put figures in these paintings, people,
and I loved this new environment,
so I wanted to have
both people and this atmosphere.
When the idea hit me of how to do this,
I got kind of nauseous and dizzy,
which is really just adrenaline, probably,
but for me it's a really good sign.
And so now I want to show you
what I've been working on.
It's something I haven't shown yet,
and it's like a preview, I guess,
of my upcoming show,
what I have so far.
Expansive space
instead of the isolated bathtub.
I'm going outside instead of inside.
Loosening control,
savoring the imperfections,
allowing the --
allowing the imperfections.
And in that imperfection,
you can find a vulnerability.
I could feel my deepest intention,
what matters most to me,
that human connection
that can happen in a space
where there's no resisting or controlling.
I want to make paintings about that.
So here's what I learned.
We're all going to have
big losses in our lives,
maybe a job or a career,
relationships, love, our youth.
We're going to lose our health,
people we love.
These kinds of losses
are out of our control.
They're unpredictable,
and they bring us to our knees.
And so I say, let them.
Fall to your knees. Be humbled.
Let go of trying to change it
or even wanting it to be different.
It just is.
And then there's space,
and in that space feel your vulnerability,
what matters most to you,
your deepest intention.
And be curious to connect
to what and who is really here,
awake and alive.
It's what we all want.
Let's take the opportunity
to find something beautiful
in the unknown, in the unpredictable,
and even in the awful.
Thank you.
(Applause)
I have spent my entire life
either at the schoolhouse,
on the way to the schoolhouse,
or talking about what happens
in the schoolhouse.
(Laughter)
Both my parents were educators,
my maternal grandparents were educators,
and for the past 40 years,
I've done the same thing.
And so, needless to say, over those years
I've had a chance
to look at education reform
from a lot of perspectives.
Some of those reforms have been good.
Some of them have been not so good.
And we know why kids drop out.
We know why kids don't learn.
It's either poverty, low attendance,
negative peer influences...
We know why.
But one of the things
that we never discuss
or we rarely discuss
is the value and importance
of human connection.
Relationships.
James Comer says
that no significant learning
can occur without
a significant relationship.
George Washington Carver says all learning
is understanding relationships.
Everyone in this room has been affected
by a teacher or an adult.
For years, I have watched people teach.
I have looked at the best
and I've looked at some of the worst.
A colleague said to me one time,
"They don't pay me to like the kids.
They pay me to teach a lesson.
The kids should learn it.
I should teach it, they should learn it,
Case closed."
Well, I said to her,
"You know, kids don't learn
from people they don't like."
(Laughter)
(Applause)
She said, "That's just a bunch of hooey."
And I said to her,
"Well, your year is going to be
long and arduous, dear."
Needless to say, it was.
Some people think that you can either
have it in you to build a relationship,
or you don't.
I think Stephen Covey had the right idea.
He said you ought to just
throw in a few simple things,
like seeking first to understand,
as opposed to being understood.
Simple things, like apologizing.
You ever thought about that?
Tell a kid you're sorry, they're in shock.
(Laughter)
I taught a lesson once on ratios.
I'm not real good with math,
but I was working on it.
(Laughter)
And I got back and looked
at that teacher edition.
I'd taught the whole lesson wrong.
(Laughter)
So I came back to class
the next day and I said,
"Look, guys, I need to apologize.
I taught the whole lesson wrong.
I'm so sorry."
They said, "That's okay, Ms. Pierson.
You were so excited, we just let you go."
I have had classes that were so low,
so academically deficient, that I cried.
I wondered, "How am I
going to take this group,
in nine months,
from where they are
to where they need to be?
And it was difficult, it was awfully hard.
How do I raise the self-esteem of a child
and his academic achievement
at the same time?
One year I came up with a bright idea.
I told all my students,
"You were chosen to be in my class
because I am the best teacher
and you are the best students,
they put us all together
so we could show
everybody else how to do it."
One of the students said, "Really?"
(Laughter)
I said, "Really. We have
to show the other classes
how to do it, so when
we walk down the hall,
people will notice us,
so you can't make noise.
You just have to strut."
(Laughter)
And I gave them a saying to say:
"I am somebody.
I was somebody when I came.
I'll be a better somebody when I leave.
I am powerful, and I am strong.
I deserve the education that I get here.
I have things to do, people to impress,
and places to go."
And they said, "Yeah!"
(Laughter)
You say it long enough,
it starts to be a part of you.
(Applause)
I gave a quiz, 20 questions.
A student missed 18.
I put a "+2" on his paper
and a big smiley face.
(Laughter)
He said, "Ms. Pierson, is this an F?"
I said, "Yes."
(Laughter)
He said, "Then why'd you
put a smiley face?"
I said, "Because you're on a roll.
You got two right.
You didn't miss them all."
(Laughter)
I said, "And when we review this,
won't you do better?"
He said, "Yes, ma'am, I can do better."
You see, "-18" sucks
all the life out of you.
"+2" said, "I ain't all bad."
For years, I watched my mother
take the time at recess to review,
go on home visits in the afternoon,
buy combs and brushes
and peanut butter and crackers
to put in her desk drawer
for kids that needed to eat,
and a washcloth and some soap
for the kids who didn't smell so good.
See, it's hard to teach kids who stink.
(Laughter)
And kids can be cruel.
And so she kept those things in her desk,
and years later, after she retired,
I watched some of those
same kids come through
and say to her, "You know, Ms. Walker,
you made a difference in my life.
You made it work for me.
You made me feel like I was somebody,
when I knew, at the bottom, I wasn't.
And I want you to just
see what I've become."
And when my mama died two years ago at 92,
there were so many former
students at her funeral,
it brought tears to my eyes,
not because she was gone,
but because she left
a legacy of relationships
that could never disappear.
Can we stand to have more relationships?
Absolutely.
Will you like all your children?
Of course not.
(Laughter)
And you know your toughest
kids are never absent.
(Laughter)
Never.
You won't like them all,
and the tough ones show up for a reason.
It's the connection.
It's the relationships.
So teachers become
great actors and great actresses,
and we come to work
when we don't feel like it,
and we're listening to policy
that doesn't make sense,
and we teach anyway.
We teach anyway,
because that's what we do.
Teaching and learning should bring joy.
How powerful would our world be
if we had kids who were
not afraid to take risks,
who were not afraid to think,
and who had a champion?
Every child deserves a champion,
an adult who will never give up on them,
who understands the power of connection,
and insists that they become
the best that they can possibly be.
Is this job tough? You betcha.
Oh God, you betcha.
But it is not impossible.
We can do this. We're educators.
We're born to make a difference.
Thank you so much.
(Applause)
Climate change is already a heavy topic,
and it's getting heavier
because we're understanding
that we need to do more than we are.
We're understanding, in fact,
that those of us who live in the developed world
need to be really pushing towards eliminating our emissions.
That's, to put it mildly, not what's on the table now.
And it tends to feel a little overwhelming
when we look at what is there in reality today
and the magnitude of the problem that we face.
And when we have overwhelming problems in front of us,
we tend to seek simple answers.
And I think this is what we've done with climate change.
We look at where the emissions are coming from --
they're coming out of our tailpipes and smokestacks and so forth,
and we say, okay, well the problem is
that they're coming out of fossil fuels that we're burning,
so therefore, the answer must be
to replace those fossil fuels with clean sources of energy.
And while, of course, we do need clean energy,
I would put to you that it's possible
that by looking at climate change
as a clean energy generation problem,
we're in fact setting ourselves up
not to solve it.
And the reason why
is that we live on a planet
that is rapidly urbanizing.
That shouldn't be news to any of us.
However, it's hard sometimes
to remember the extent of that urbanization.
By mid-century,
we're going to have about eight billion -- perhaps more -- people
living in cities or within a day's travel of one.
We will be an overwhelmingly urban species.
In order to provide
the kind of energy that it would take
for eight billion people living in cities
that are even somewhat like the cities
that those of us in the global North live in today,
we would have to generate
an absolutely astonishing amount of energy.
It may be possible
that we are not even able
to build that much clean energy.
So if we're seriously talking about tackling climate change
on an urbanizing planet,
we need to look somewhere else for the solution.
The solution, in fact, may be closer to hand than we think,
because all of those cities we're building
are opportunities.
Every city determines to a very large extent
the amount of energy used by its inhabitants.
We tend to think of energy use as a behavioral thing --
I choose to turn this light switch on --
but really, enormous amounts of our energy use
are predestined
by the kinds of communities and cities that we live in.
I won't show you very many graphs today,
but if I can just focus on this one for a moment,
it really tells us a lot of what we need to know --
which is, quite simply,
that if you look, for example, at transportation,
a major category of climate emissions,
there is a direct relationship
between how dense a city is
and the amount of climate emissions
that its residents spew out into the air.
And the correlation, of course,
is that denser places tend to have lower emissions --
which isn't really all that difficult to figure out, if you think about it.
Basically,
we substitute, in our lives,
access to the things we want.
We go out there and we hop in our cars
and we drive from place to place.
And we're basically using mobility to get the access we need.
But when we live in a denser community,
suddenly what we find, of course,
is that the things we need are close by.
And since the most sustainable trip
is the one that you never had to make in the first place,
suddenly our lives become instantly more sustainable.
And it is possible, of course,
to increase the density of the communities around us.
Some places are doing this with new eco districts,
developing whole new sustainable neighborhoods,
which is nice work if you can get it,
but most of the time, what we're talking about is, in fact,
reweaving the urban fabric that we already have.
So we're talking about things like infill development:
really sharp little changes
to where we have buildings, where we're developing.
Urban retrofitting:
creating different sorts of spaces and uses
out of places that are already there.
Increasingly, we're realizing
that we don't even need to densify an entire city.
What we need instead is an average density
that rises to a level
where we don't drive as much and so on.
And that can be done
by raising the density in very specific spots a whole lot.
So you can think of it as tent poles
that actually raise the density of the entire city.
And we find that when we do that,
we can, in fact, have a few places that are really hyper-dense
within a wider fabric of places
that are perhaps a little more comfortable
and achieve the same results.
Now we may find that there are places that are really, really dense
and still hold onto their cars,
but the reality is that, by and large,
what we see when we get a lot of people together with the right conditions
is a threshold effect,
where people simply stop driving as much,
and increasingly, more and more people,
if they're surrounded by places that make them feel at home,
give up their cars altogether.
And this is a huge, huge energy savings,
because what comes out of our tailpipe
is really just the beginning of the story
with climate emissions from cars.
We have the manufacture of the car, the disposal of the car,
all of the parking and freeways and so on.
When you can get rid of all of those
because somebody doesn't use any of them really,
you find that you can actually cut transportation emissions
as much as 90 percent.
And people are embracing this.
All around the world, we're seeing more and more people embrace this walkshed life.
People are saying that it's moving from the idea of the dream home
to the dream neighborhood.
And when you layer that over
with the kind of ubiquitous communications that we're starting to see,
what you find is, in fact,
even more access suffused into spaces.
Some of it's transportation access.
This is a Mapnificent map that shows me, in this case,
how far I can get from my home in 30 minutes
using public transportation.
Some of it is about walking. It's not all perfect yet.
This is Google Walking Maps.
I asked how to do the greater Ridgeway,
and it told me to go via Guernsey.
It did tell me that this route
maybe missing sidewalks or pedestrian paths, though.
(Laughter)
But the technologies are getting better,
and we're starting to really kind of crowdsource this navigation.
And as we just heard earlier,
of course, we're also learning how to put information on dumb objects.
Things that don't have any wiring in them at all,
we're learning how to include
in these systems of notation and navigation.
Part of what we're finding with this
is that what we thought
was the major point
of manufacturing and consumption,
which is to get a bunch of stuff,
is not, in fact,
how we really live best in dense environments.
What we're finding is that what we want
is access to the capacities of things.
My favorite example is a drill. Who here owns a drill, a home power drill?
Okay. I do too.
The average home power drill is used somewhere between six and 20 minutes
in its entire lifetime,
depending on who you ask.
And so what we do is we buy these drills
that have a potential capacity of thousands of hours of drill time,
use them once or twice to put a hole in the wall and let them sit.
Our cities, I would put to you,
are stockpiles of these surplus capacities.
And while we could try and figure out
new ways to use those capacities --
such as cooking or making ice sculptures
or even a mafia hit --
what we probably will find
is that, in fact, turning those products into services
that we have access to when we want them,
is a far smarter way to go.
And in fact, even space itself is turning into a service.
We're finding that people can share the same spaces,
do stuff with vacant space.
Buildings are becoming bundles of services.
So we have new designs
that are helping us take mechanical things that we used to spend energy on --
like heating, cooling etc. --
and turn them into things that we avoid spending energy on.
So we light our buildings with daylight.
We cool them with breezes. We heat them with sunshine.
In fact, when we use all these things,
what we've found is that, in some cases,
energy use in a building can drop as much as 90 percent.
Which brings on another threshold effect
I like to call furnace dumping,
which is, quite simply,
if you have a building that doesn't need to be heated with a furnace,
you save a whole bunch of money up front.
These things actually become cheaper to build
than the alternatives.
Now when we look at being able
to slash our product use, slash our transportation use,
slash our building energy use,
all of that is great, but it still leaves something behind.
And if we're going to really, truly become sustainable cities,
we need to think a little differently.
This is one way to do it.
This is Vancouver's propaganda about how green a city they are.
And certainly lots of people have taken to heart
this idea that a sustainable city is covered in greenery.
So we have visions like this.
We have visions like this. We have visions like this.
Now all of these are fine projects,
but they really have missed an essential point,
which is it's not about the leaves above,
it's about the systems below.
Do they, for instance, capture rainwater
so that we can reduce water use?
Water is energy intensive.
Do they, perhaps, include green infrastructure,
so that we can take runoff
and water that's going out of our houses
and clean it and filter it
and grow urban street trees?
Do they connect us back to the ecosystems around us
by, for example, connecting us to rivers
and allowing for restoration?
Do they allow for pollination,
pollinator pathways
that bees and butterflies and such can come back into our cities?
Do they even take the very waste matter
that we have from food and fiber and so forth,
and turn it back into soil
and sequester carbon --
take carbon out of the air
in the process of using our cities?
I would submit to you that all of these things are not only possible,
they're being done right now,
and that it's a darn good thing.
Because right now, our economy by and large
operates as Paul Hawken said,
"by stealing the future, selling it in the present
and calling it GDP."
And if we have another eight billion
or seven billion,
or six billion, even, people,
living on a planet where their cities also steal the future,
we're going to run out of future really fast.
But if we think differently,
I think that, in fact, we can have cities
that are not only zero emissions,
but have unlimited possibilities as well.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
I collaborate with bacteria.
And I'm about to show you
some stop-motion footage that I made recently
where you'll see bacteria accumulating minerals
from their environment
over the period of an hour.
So what you're seeing here
is the bacteria metabolizing,
and as they do so
they create an electrical charge.
And this attracts metals
from their local environment.
And these metals accumulate as minerals
on the surface of the bacteria.
One of the most pervasive problems
in the world today for people
is inadequate access
to clean drinking water.
And the desalination process
is one where we take out salts.
We can use it for drinking and agriculture.
Removing the salts from water --
particularly seawater --
through reverse osmosis
is a critical technique
for countries who do not have access to clean drinking water
around the globe.
So seawater reverse osmosis
is a membrane-filtration technology.
We take the water from the sea
and we apply pressure.
And this pressure forces the seawater
through a membrane.
This takes energy,
producing clean water.
But we're also left with a concentrated salt solution, or brine.
But the process is very expensive
and it's cost-prohibitive for many countries around the globe.
And also, the brine that's produced
is oftentimes just pumped back out into the sea.
And this is detrimental to the local ecology
of the sea area that it's pumped back out into.
So I work in Singapore at the moment,
and this is a place that's really a leading place
for desalination technology.
And Singapore proposes by 2060
to produce [900] million liters per day
of desalinated water.
But this will produce an equally massive amount
of desalination brine.
And this is where my collaboration with bacteria comes into play.
So what we're doing at the moment
is we're accumulating metals
like calcium, potassium and magnesium
from out of desalination brine.
And this, in terms of magnesium
and the amount of water that I just mentioned,
equates to a $4.5 billion
mining industry for Singapore --
a place that doesn't have any natural resources.
So I'd like you to image a mining industry
in a way that one hasn't existed before;
imagine a mining industry
that doesn't mean defiling the Earth;
imagine bacteria helping us do this
by accumulating and precipitating
and sedimenting minerals
out of desalination brine.
And what you can see here
is the beginning of an industry in a test tube,
a mining industry that is in harmony with nature.
Thank you.
(Applause)
In Kenya, 1984 is known
as the year of the cup,
or the goro goro.
The goro goro is a cup used to measure
two kilograms of maize flower on the market,
and the maize flower is used to make ugali,
a polenta-like cake that is eaten
together with vegetables.
Both the maize and the vegetables are grown
on most Kenyan farms,
which means that most families can feed themselves
from their own farm.
One goro goro can feed three meals
for an average family,
and in 1984, the whole harvest
could fit in one goro goro.
It was and still is one of the worst droughts
in living memory.
Now today, I insure farmers against droughts
like those in the year of the cup,
or to be more specific, I insure the rains.
I come from a family of missionaries
who built hospitals in Indonesia,
and my father built a psychiatric hospital
in Tanzania.
This is me, age five, in front of that hospital.
I don't think they thought I'd grow up
to sell insurance. (Laughter)
So let me tell you how that happened.
In 2008, I was working
for the Ministry of Agriculture of Rwanda,
and my boss had just been promoted
to become the minister.
She launched an ambitious plan
to start a green revolution in her country,
and before we knew it, we were importing
tons of fertilizer and seed
and telling farmers how to apply that fertilizer
and plant.
A couple of weeks later,
the International Monetary Fund visited us,
and asked my minister,
"Minister, it's great that you want to help farmers
reach food security, but what if it doesn't rain?"
My minister answered proudly
and somewhat defiantly,
"I am going to pray for rain."
That ended the discussion.
On the way back to the ministry in the car,
she turned around to me and said,
"Rose, you've always been interested in finance.
Go find us some insurance."
It's been six years since,
and last year I was fortunate enough
to be part of a team that insured
over 185,000 farmers in Kenya and Rwanda
against drought.
They owned an average of half an acre
and paid on average two Euros in premium.
It's microinsurance.
Now, traditional insurance doesn't work
with two to three Euros of premium,
because traditional insurance relies on farm visits.
A farmer here in Germany would be visited
for the start of the season, halfway through,
and at the end, and again if there was a loss,
to estimate the damages.
For a small-scale farmer in the middle of Africa,
the maths of doing those visits
simply don't add up.
So instead, we rely on technology and data.
This satellite measures
whether there were clouds or not,
because think about it:
If there are clouds, then you might have some rain,
but if there are no clouds,
then it's actually impossible for it to rain.
These images show the onset of the rains
this season in Kenya.
You see that around March 6,
the clouds move in and then disappear,
and then around the March 11,
the clouds really move in.
That, and those clouds,
were the onset of the rains this year.
This satellite covers the whole of Africa
and goes back as far as 1984,
and that's important, because if you know
how many times a place has had a drought
in the last 30 years,
you can make a pretty good estimate
what the chances are of drought in the future,
and that means that you can put a price tag
on the risk of drought.
The data alone isn't enough.
We devise agronomic algorithms
which tell us how much rainfall
a crop needs and when.
For example, for maize at planting,
you need to have two days of rain
for farmers to plant,
and then it needs to rain once every two weeks
for the crop to properly germinate.
After that, you need rain every three weeks
for the crop to form its leaves,
whereas at flowering, you
need it to rain more frequently,
about once every 10 days
for the crop to form its cob.
At the end of the season,
you actually don't want it to rain,
because rains then can damage the crop.
Devising such a cover is difficult,
but it turned out the real challenge
was selling insurance.
We set ourselves a modest target
of 500 farmers insured after our first season.
After a couple of months' intense marketing,
we had signed up the grand total
of 185 farmers.
I was disappointed and confounded.
Everybody kept telling me that farmers
wanted insurance,
but our prime customers simply weren't buying.
They were waiting to see what would happen,
didn't trust insurance companies,
or thought, "I've managed for so many years.
Why would I buy insurance now?"
Now many of you know microcredit,
the method of providing small loans to poor people
pioneered by Muhammad Yunus,
who won the Nobel Peace Prize
for his work with the Grameen Bank.
Turns out, selling microcredit
isn't the same as selling insurance.
For credit, a farmer needs
to earn the trust of a bank,
and if it succeeds, the bank will advance him money.
That's an attractive proposition.
For insurance, the farmer needs to trust
the insurance company, and needs
to advance the insurance company money.
It's a very different value proposition.
And so the uptick of insurance has been slow,
with so far only 4.4 percent of Africans
taking up insurance in 2012,
and half of that number is in one country,
South Africa.
We tried for some years
selling insurance directly to farmers,
with very high marketing cost
and very limited success.
Then we realized that there were many organizations
working with farmers:
seed companies, microfinance institutions,
mobile phone companies,
government agencies.
They were all providing loans to farmers,
and often, just before they'd finalize the loan,
the farmer would say,
"But what if it doesn't rain?
How do you expect me to repay my loan?"
Many of these organizations
were taking on the risk themselves,
simply hoping that that year,
the worst wouldn't happen.
Most of the organizations, however,
were limiting their growth in agriculture.
They couldn't take on this kind of risk.
These organizations became our customers,
and when combining credit and insurance,
interesting things can happen.
Let me tell you one more story.
At the start of February 2012 in western Kenya,
the rains started, and they started early,
and when rains start early, farmers are encouraged,
because it usually means that
the season is going to be good.
So they took out loans and planted.
For the next three weeks,
there wasn't a single drop of rain,
and the crops that had germinated so well
shriveled and died.
We'd insured the loans of a microfinance institution
that had provided those loans
to about 6,000 farmers in that area,
and we called them up and said,
"Look, we know about the drought.
We've got you.
We'll give you 200,000 Euros
at the end of the season."
They said, "Wow, that's great,
but that'll be late.
Could you give us the money now?
Then these farmers can still replant
and can get a harvest this season."
So we convinced our insurance partners,
and later that April, these farmers replanted.
We took the idea of replanting to a seed company
and convinced them to price the cost of insurance
into every bag of seed,
and in every bag, we packed a card
that had a number on it,
and when the farmers would open the card,
they'd text in that number,
and that number would actually help us
to locate the farmer
and allocate them to a satellite pixel.
A satellite would then measure the rainfall
for the next three weeks,
and if it didn't rain,
we'd replace their seed.
One of the first —
(Applause) — Hold on, I'm not there!
One of the first beneficiaries
of this replanting guarantee
was Bosco Mwinyi.
We visited his farm later that August,
and I wish I could show you the smile on his face
when he showed us his harvest,
because it warmed my heart
and it made me realize why selling insurance
can be a good thing.
But you know, he insisted
that we get his whole harvest in the picture,
so we had to zoom out a lot.
Insurance secured his harvest that season,
and I believe that today,
we have all the tools to enable African farmers
to take control of their own destiny.
No more years of the cup.
Instead, I am looking forward to, at least somehow,
the year of the insurance,
or the year of the great harvest.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Humanity takes center stage at TED,
but I would like to add 
a voice for the animals,
whose bodies and minds 
and spirits shaped us.
Some years ago, it was my good fortune
to meet a tribal elder on an island
not far from Vancouver.
His name is Jimmy Smith,
and he shared a story with me
that is told among his people,
who call themselves the Kwikwasut'inuxw.
Once upon a time, he told me,
all animals on Earth were one.
Even though they look different on the outside,
inside, they're all the same,
and from time to time they would gather
at a sacred cave deep inside the forest
to celebrate their unity.
When they arrived,
they would all take off their skins.
Raven shed his feathers, bear his fur,
and salmon her scales,
and then, they would dance.
But one day, a human made it to the cave
and laughed at what he saw
because he did not understand.
Embarrassed, the animals fled,
and that was the last time
they revealed themselves this way.
The ancient understanding that underneath
their separate identities, all animals are one,
has been a powerful inspiration to me.
I like to get past the fur, the feathers
and the scales.
I want to get under the skin.
No matter whether I'm facing a giant elephant
or a tiny tree frog,
my goal is to connect us with them, eye to eye.
You may wonder, do I ever photograph people?
Sure. People are always present in my photos,
no matter whether they appear
to portray tortoises
or cougars
or lions.
You just have to learn how 
to look past their disguise.
As a photographer,
I try to reach beyond the differences
in our genetic makeup
to appreciate all we have in common
with every other living thing.
When I use my camera,
I drop my skin
like the animals at that cave
so I can show who they really are.
As animals blessed
with the power of rational thought,
we can marvel at the intricacies of life.
As citizens of a planet in trouble,
it is our moral responsibility
to deal with the dramatic loss in diversity of life.
But as humans with hearts,
we can all rejoice in the unity of life,
and perhaps we can change
what once happened in that sacred cave.
Let's find a way to join the dance.
Thank you.
(Applause)
(Music)

I'd like to take you back
about seven years in my life.
Friday afternoon,
a few days before Christmas 2009,
I was the director of operations
at a consumer products company
in San Francisco,
and I was called into a meeting
that was already in progress.
That meeting turned out
to be my exit interview.
I was fired, along with several others.
I was 64 years old at the time.
It wasn't completely unexpected.
I signed a stack of papers,
gathered my personal effects,
and left to join my wife
who was waiting for me
at a nearby restaurant,
completely unaware.
Fast-forward several hours,
we both got really silly drunk.
(Laughter)
So, 40 plus years of continuous employment
for a variety of companies,
large and small,
was over.
I had a good a network,
a good reputation --
I thought I'd be just fine.
I was an engineer
in manufacturing and packaging,
I had a good background.
Retirement was, like for so many people,
simply not an option for me,
so I turned to consulting
for the next couple of years
without any passion whatsoever.
And then an idea began to take root,
born from my concern for our environment.
I wanted to build my own business,
designing and manufacturing
biodegradable packaging from waste --
paper, agricultural, even textile waste --
replacing the toxic,
disposable plastic packaging
to which we've all become addicted.
This is called clean technology,
and it felt really meaningful to me.
A venture that could help to reduce
the billions of pounds
of single-use plastic packaging
dumped each year,
and polluting our land,
our rivers and our oceans,
and left for future
generations to resolve --
our grandchildren,
my grandchildren.
And so now at the age of 66,
with 40 years of experience,
I became an entrepreneur
for the very first time.
(Cheers)
(Applause)
Thank you.
But there's more.
(Laughter)
Lots of issues to deal with:
manufacturing, outsourcing, job creation,
patents, partnerships, funding --
these are all typical
issues for a start-up,
but hardly typical for me.
And a word about funding.
I live and work in San Francisco,
and if you're looking for funding,
you are typically going to compete
with some very young people
from the high-tech industry,
and it can be very discouraging
and intimidating.
I have shoes older
than most of these people.
(Laughter)
I do.
(Laughter)
But five years later,
I'm thrilled and proud to share with you
that our revenues have doubled every year,
we have no debt,
we have several marquee clients,
our patent was issued,
I have a wonderful partner
who's been with me
right from the beginning,
and we've won more than 20 awards
for the work that we've done.
But best of all,
we've made a small dent --
a very small dent --
in the worldwide plastic pollution crisis.
(Applause)
And I am doing the most rewarding
and meaningful work of my life right now.
I can tell you there's lots of resources
available to entrepreneurs of all ages,
but what I really yearned for
five years ago
was to find other first-time entrepreneurs
who were my age.
I wanted to connect with them.
I had no role models, absolutely none.
That 20-something app developer
from Silicon Valley
was not my role model.
(Laughter)
I'm sure he was very clever --
(Laughter)
I want to do something about that,
and I want all of us
to do something about that.
I want us to start talking more
about people who don't become
entrepreneurs until they are seniors.
Talking about these bold
men and women who are checking in
when their peers, in essence,
are checking out.
And then connecting all these people
across industries, across regions,
across countries --
building a community.
You know, the Small Business
Administration tells us
that 64 percent of new jobs
created in the private sector in the USA
are thanks to small businesses like mine.
And who's to say
that we'll stay forever small?
We have an interesting culture
that really expects
when you reach a certain age,
you're going to be golfing,
or playing checkers,
or babysitting the grandkids
all of the time.
And I adore my grandchildren --
(Laughter)
and I'm also passionate
about doing something meaningful
in the global marketplace.
And I'm going to have lots of company.
The Census Bureau says that by 2050,
there will be 84 million seniors
in this country.
That's an amazing number.
That's almost twice as many
as we have today.
Can you imagine how many
first-time entrepreneurs there will be
among 84 million people?
And they'll all have
four decades of experience.
(Laughter)
So when I say, "Let's start talking more
about these wonderful entrepreneurs,"
I mean, let's talk about their ventures,
just as we do the ventures
of their much younger counterparts.
The older entrepreneurs in this country
have a 70 percent success rate
starting new ventures.
70 percent success rate.
We're like the Golden State Warriors
of entrepreneurs --
(Laughter)
(Applause)
And that number plummets to 28 percent
for younger entrepreneurs.
This is according to a UK-based
group called CMI.
Aren't the accomplishments
of a 70-year-old entrepreneur
every bit as meaningful,
every bit as newsworthy,
as the accomplishments
of a 30-year-old entrepreneur?
Of course they are.
That's why I'd like to make the phrase
"70 over 70" just as --
(Laughter)
just as commonplace
as the phrase "30 under 30."
(Applause)
Thank you.
(Cheers)
(Applause)
I want you to take a look at this baby.
What you're drawn to are her eyes
and the skin you love to touch.
But today I'm going to talk to you
about something you can't see.
What's going on
up in that little brain of hers.
The modern tools of neuroscience
are demonstrating to us
that what's going on up there
is nothing short of rocket science.
And what we're learning
is going to shed some light
on what the romantic writers and poets
described as the "celestial openness"
of the child's mind.
What we see here is a mother in India,
and she's speaking Koro,
which is a newly discovered language.
And she's talking to her baby.
What this mother --
and the 800 people who speak
Koro in the world --
understands is that,
to preserve this language,
they need to speak it to the babies.
And therein lies a critical puzzle.
Why is it that you can't
preserve a language
by speaking to you and I, to the adults?
Well, it's got to do with your brain.
What we see here is that language
has a critical period for learning.
The way to read this slide is to look
at your age on the horizontal axis.
(Laughter)
And you'll see on the vertical
your skill at acquiring a second language.
The babies and children are geniuses
until they turn seven,
and then there's a systematic decline.
After puberty, we fall off the map.
No scientists dispute this curve,
but laboratories all over the world
are trying to figure out
why it works this way.
Work in my lab is focused on the first
critical period in development,
and that is the period in which babies
try to master which sounds
are used in their language.
We think, by studying
how the sounds are learned,
we'll have a model
for the rest of language,
and perhaps for critical periods
that may exist in childhood
for social, emotional
and cognitive development.
So we've been studying the babies
using a technique
that we're using all over the world
and the sounds of all languages.
The baby sits on a parent's lap,
and we train them to turn
their heads when a sound changes --
like from "ah" to "ee."
If they do so at the appropriate time,
the black box lights up
and a panda bear pounds a drum.
A six-monther adores the task.
What have we learned?
Well, babies all over the world
are what I like to describe
as "citizens of the world."
They can discriminate
all the sounds of all languages,
no matter what country we're testing
and what language we're using,
and that's remarkable
because you and I can't do that.
We're culture-bound listeners.
We can discriminate the sounds
of our own language,
but not those of foreign languages.
So the question arises:
When do those citizens of the world
turn into the language-bound
listeners that we are?
And the answer:
before their first birthdays.
What you see here is performance
on that head-turn task
for babies tested in Tokyo
and the United States,
here in Seattle,
as they listened to "ra" and "la" --
sounds important to English,
but not to Japanese.
So at six to eight months,
the babies are totally equivalent.
Two months later,
something incredible occurs.
The babies in the United States
are getting a lot better,
babies in Japan are getting a lot worse,
but both of those groups of babies
are preparing for exactly the language
that they are going to learn.
So the question is: What's happening
during this critical two-month period?
This is the critical period
for sound development,
but what's going on up there?
So there are two things going on.
The first is that the babies
are listening intently to us,
and they're taking statistics
as they listen to us talk --
they're taking statistics.
So listen to two mothers
speaking motherese --
the universal language
we use when we talk to kids --
first in English and then in Japanese.
(Video) Ah, I love your big blue eyes --
so pretty and nice.
(Japanese)
Patricia Kuhl: During the production
of speech, when babies listen,
what they're doing is taking statistics
on the language that they hear.
And those distributions grow.
And what we've learned is that babies
are sensitive to the statistics,
and the statistics of Japanese
and English are very, very different.
English has a lot of Rs and Ls.
The distribution shows.
And the distribution of Japanese
is totally different,
where we see a group
of intermediate sounds,
which is known as the Japanese "R."
So babies absorb
the statistics of the language
and it changes their brains;
it changes them
from the citizens of the world
to the culture-bound
listeners that we are.
But we as adults are no longer
absorbing those statistics.
We are governed
by the representations in memory
that were formed early in development.
So what we're seeing here
is changing our models
of what the critical period is about.
We're arguing from
a mathematical standpoint
that the learning of language
material may slow down
when our distributions stabilize.
It's raising lots of questions
about bilingual people.
Bilinguals must keep two sets
of statistics in mind at once
and flip between them,
one after the other,
depending on who they're speaking to.
So we asked ourselves,
can the babies take statistics
on a brand new language?
And we tested this
by exposing American babies
who'd never heard a second language
to Mandarin for the first time
during the critical period.
We knew that, when monolinguals
were tested in Taipei and Seattle
on the Mandarin sounds,
they showed the same pattern.
Six to eight months,
they're totally equivalent.
Two months later,
something incredible happens.
But the Taiwanese babies are getting
better, not the American babies.
What we did was expose American babies,
during this period, to Mandarin.
It was like having Mandarin relatives
come and visit for a month
and move into your house
and talk to the babies for 12 sessions.
Here's what it looked like
in the laboratory.
(Mandarin)
PK: So what have we done
to their little brains?
(Laughter)
We had to run a control group to make sure
that coming into the laboratory
didn't improve your Mandarin skills.
So a group of babies came in
and listened to English.
And we can see from the graph
that exposure to English
didn't improve their Mandarin.
But look at what happened to the babies
exposed to Mandarin for 12 sessions.
They were as good as the babies in Taiwan
who'd been listening
for 10 and a half months.
What it demonstrated is that babies
take statistics on a new language.
Whatever you put in front of them,
they'll take statistics on.
But we wondered what role
the human being played
in this learning exercise.
So we ran another group of babies
in which the kids got the same dosage,
the same 12 sessions,
but over a television set.
And another group of babies
who had just audio exposure
and looked at a teddy bear on the screen.
What did we do to their brains?
What you see here is the audio result --
no learning whatsoever --
and the video result --
no learning whatsoever.
It takes a human being
for babies to take their statistics.
The social brain is controlling
when the babies
are taking their statistics.
We want to get inside the brain
and see this thing happening
as babies are in front of televisions,
as opposed to in front of human beings.
Thankfully, we have a new machine,
magnetoencephalography,
that allows us to do this.
It looks like a hair dryer from Mars.
But it's completely safe,
completely noninvasive and silent.
We're looking at millimeter accuracy
with regard to spatial
and millisecond accuracy
using 306 SQUIDs --
these are superconducting
quantum interference devices --
to pick up the magnetic fields
that change as we do our thinking.
We're the first in the world
to record babies in an MEG machine
while they are learning.
So this is little Emma.
She's a six-monther.
And she's listening to various languages
in the earphones that are in her ears.
You can see, she can move around.
We're tracking her head
with little pellets in a cap,
so she's free to move
completely unconstrained.
It's a technical tour de force.
What are we seeing?
We're seeing the baby brain.
As the baby hears a word in her language,
the auditory areas light up,
and then subsequently areas surrounding it
that we think are related to coherence,
getting the brain coordinated
with its different areas, and causality,
one brain area
causing another to activate.
We are embarking on a grand
and golden age of knowledge
about child's brain development.
We're going to be able
to see a child's brain
as they experience an emotion,
as they learn to speak and read,
as they solve a math problem,
as they have an idea.
And we're going to be able to invent
brain-based interventions
for children who have difficulty learning.
Just as the poets and writers described,
we're going to be able to see, I think,
that wondrous openness,
utter and complete openness,
of the mind of a child.
In investigating the child's brain,
we're going to uncover deep truths
about what it means to be human,
and in the process,
we may be able to help keep
our own minds open to learning
for our entire lives.
Thank you.
(Applause)
I'm an underwater explorer,
more specifically a cave diver.
I wanted to be an astronaut
when I was a little kid,
but growing up in Canada as a young girl,
that wasn't really available to me.
But as it turns out,
we know a lot more about space
than we do about the underground waterways
coursing through our planet,
the very lifeblood of Mother Earth.
So I decided to do something
that was even more remarkable.
Instead of exploring outer space,
I wanted to explore
the wonders of inner space.
Now, a lot of people will tell you
that cave diving is perhaps
one of the most dangerous endeavors.
I mean, imagine yourself
here in this room,
if you were suddenly
plunged into blackness,
with your only job to find the exit,
sometimes swimming
through these large spaces,
and at other times
crawling beneath the seats,
following a thin guideline,
just waiting for the life support
to provide your very next breath.
Well, that's my workplace.
But what I want to teach you today
is that our world
is not one big solid rock.
It's a whole lot more like a sponge.
I can swim through a lot of the pores
in our earth's sponge,
but where I can't,
other life-forms and other materials
can make that journey without me.
And my voice is the one
that's going to teach you
about the inside of Mother Earth.
There was no guidebook available to me
when I decided to be the first person
to cave dive inside Antarctic icebergs.
In 2000, this was the largest
moving object on the planet.
It calved off the Ross Ice Shelf,
and we went down there
to explore ice edge ecology
and search for life-forms beneath the ice.
We use a technology called rebreathers.
It's an awful lot like the same technology
that is used for space walks.
This technology enables us to go deeper
than we could've imagined
even 10 years ago.
We use exotic gases,
and we can make missions
even up to 20 hours long underwater.
I work with biologists.
It turns out that caves
are repositories of amazing life-forms,
species that we never knew existed before.
Many of these life-forms
live in unusual ways.
They have no pigment
and no eyes in many cases,
and these animals
are also extremely long-lived.
In fact, animals swimming
in these caves today
are identical in the fossil record
that predates the extinction
of the dinosaurs.
So imagine that: these are
like little swimming dinosaurs.
What can they teach us
about evolution and survival?
When we look at an animal
like this remipede swimming in the jar,
he has giant fangs with venom.
He can actually attack something
40 times his size and kill it.
If he were the size of a cat,
he'd be the most dangerous
thing on our planet.
And these animals live
in remarkably beautiful places,
and in some cases,
caves like this, that are very young,
yet the animals are ancient.
How did they get there?
I also work with physicists,
and they're interested oftentimes
in global climate change.
They can take rocks within the caves,
and they can slice them
and look at the layers within with rocks,
much like the rings of a tree,
and they can count back in history
and learn about the climate on our planet
at very different times.
The red that you see in this photograph
is actually dust from the Sahara Desert.
So it's been picked up by wind,
blown across the Atlantic Ocean.
It's rained down in this case
on the island of Abaco in the Bahamas.
It soaks in through the ground
and deposits itself
in the rocks within these caves.
And when we look back in the layers
of these rocks, we can find times
when the climate
was very, very dry on earth,
and we can go back
many hundreds of thousands of years.
Paleoclimatologists are also interested
in where the sea level stands were
at other times on earth.
Here in Bermuda, my team and I embarked
on the deepest manned dives
ever conducted in the region,
and we were looking for places
where the sea level
used to lap up against the shoreline,
many hundreds of feet
below current levels.
I also get to work with paleontologists
and archaeologists.
In places like Mexico,
in the Bahamas, and even in Cuba,
we're looking at cultural remains
and also human remains in caves,
and they tell us a lot
about some of the earliest
inhabitants of these regions.
But my very favorite project of all
was over 15 years ago,
when I was a part of the team
that made the very first
accurate, three-dimensional map
of a subterranean surface.
This device that I'm
driving through the cave
was actually creating
a three-dimensional model as we drove it.
We also used ultra low frequency radio
to broadcast back to the surface
our exact position within the cave.
So I swam under houses and businesses
and bowling alleys and golf courses,
and even under a Sonny's BBQ Restaurant,
Pretty remarkable, and what that taught me
was that everything we do
on the surface of our earth
will be returned to us to drink.
Our water planet is not just
rivers, lakes and oceans,
but it's this vast network of groundwater
that knits us all together.
It's a shared resource
from which we all drink.
And when we can understand
our human connections with our groundwater
and all of our water resources
on this planet,
then we'll be working on the problem
that's probably the most important
issue of this century.
So I never got to be that astronaut
that I always wanted to be,
but this mapping device,
designed by Dr. Bill Stone, will be.
It's actually morphed.
It's now a self-swimming autonomous robot,
artificially intelligent,
and its ultimate goal
is to go to Jupiter's moon Europa
and explore oceans beneath
the frozen surface of that body.
And that's pretty amazing.
(Applause)
Now I'm going to give you a story.
It's an Indian story about an Indian woman and her journey.
Let me begin with my parents.
I'm a product of this
visionary mother and father.
Many years ago, when I was born in the '50s --
'50s and '60s
didn't belong to girls in India.
They belonged to boys.
They belonged to boys who would join business
and inherit business from parents,
and girls would be dolled up to get married.
My family, in my city,
and almost in the country, was unique.
We were four of us, not one,
and fortunately no boys.
We were four girls and no boys.
And my parents were part
of a landed property family.
My father defied his own grandfather,
almost to the point of disinheritance,
because he decided to educate
all four of us.
He sent us to one of the best schools in the city
and gave us the best education.
As I've said, when we're born, we don't choose our parents,
and when we go to school, we don't choose our school.
Children don't choose a school.
They just get the school which parents choose for them.
So this is the foundation time which I got.
I grew up like this, and so did my other three sisters.
And my father used to say at that time,
"I'm going to spread all my four daughters in four corners of the world."
I don't know if he really meant [that], but it happened.
I'm the only one who's left in India.
One is a British, another is an American
and the third is a Canadian.
So we are four of us in four corners of the world.
And since I said they're my role models,
I followed two things which my father and mother gave me.
One, they said, "Life is on an incline.
You either go up,
or you come down."
And the second thing, which has stayed with me,
which became my philosophy of life,
which made all the difference,
is: 100 things happen in your life, good or bad.
Out of 100, 90 are your creation.
They're good. They're your creation. Enjoy it.
If they're bad, they're your creation. Learn from it.
Ten are nature-sent over which you can't do a thing.
It's like a death of a relative,
or a cyclone, or a hurricane, or an earthquake.
You can't do a thing about it.
You've got to just respond to the situation.
But that response comes out of those 90 points.
Since I'm a product of this philosophy,
of 90/10,
and secondly, "life on an incline,"
that's the way I grew up
to be valuing what I got.
I'm a product of opportunities,
rare opportunities in the '50s and the '60s,
which girls didn't get,
and I was conscious of the fact that what my parents were giving me
was something unique.
Because all of my best school friends were getting dolled up
to get married with a lot of dowry,
and here I was with a tennis racket and going to school
and doing all kinds of extracurricular activities.
I thought I must tell you this.
Why I said this, is the background.
This is what comes next.
I joined the Indian Police Service as a tough woman,
a woman with indefatigable stamina,
because I used to run for my tennis titles, etc.
But I joined the Indian Police Service,
and then it was a new pattern of policing.
For me the policing stood for power to correct,
power to prevent and power to detect.
This is something like a new definition ever given in policing in India --
the power to prevent.
Because normally it was always said, power to detect, and that's it,
or power to punish.
But I decided no, it's a power to prevent,
because that's what I learned when I was growing up.
How do I prevent the 10 and never make it more than 10?
So this was how it came into my service,
and it was different from the men.
I didn't want to make it different from the men, but it was different,
because this was the way I was different.
And I redefined policing concepts in India.
I'm going to take you on two journeys,
my policing journey and my prison journey.
What you see, if you see the title
called "PM's car held."
This was the first time a prime minister of India
was given a parking ticket.
(Laughter)
That's the first time in India,
and I can tell you, that's the last time you're hearing about it.
It'll never happen again in India,
because now it was once and forever.
And the rule was, because I was sensitive,
I was compassionate, I was very sensitive to injustice,
and I was very pro-justice.
That's the reason, as a woman, I joined the Indian Police Service.
I had other options, but I didn't choose them.
So I'm going to move on.
This is about tough policing, equal policing.
Now I was known as "here's a woman that's not going to listen."
So I was sent to all indiscriminate postings,
postings which others would say no.
I now went to a prison assignment as a police officer.
Normally police officers don't want to do prison.
They sent me to prison to lock me up,
thinking, "Now there will be no cars
and no VIPs to be given tickets to.
Let's lock her up."
Here I got a prison assignment.
This was a prison assignment which was one big den of criminals.
Obviously, it was.
But 10,000 men,
of which only 400 were women -- 10,000 --
9,000 plus about 600
were men.
Terrorists, rapists,
burglars, gangsters --
some of them I'd sent to jail
as a police officer outside.
And then how did I deal with them?
The first day when I went in,
I didn't know how to look at them.
And I said, "Do you pray?" When I looked at the group, I said, "Do you pray?"
They saw me as a young, short woman wearing a pathan suit.
I said, "Do you pray?"
And they didn't say anything.
I said, "Do you pray? Do you want to pray?"
They said, "Yes." I said, "All right, let's pray."
I prayed for them, and things started to change.
This is a visual of education inside the prison.
Friends, this has never happened,
where everybody in the prison studies.
I started this with community support.
Government had no budget.
It was one of the finest, largest volunteerism
in any prison in the world.
This was initiated in Delhi prison.
You see one sample
of a prisoner teaching a class.
These are hundreds of classes.
Nine to eleven, every prisoner went into the education program --
the same den in which they thought
they would put me behind the bar and things would be forgotten.
We converted this into an ashram --
from a prison to an ashram through education.
I think that's the bigger change.
It was the beginning of a change.
Teachers were prisoners. Teachers were volunteers.
Books came from donated schoolbooks.
Stationery was donated.
Everything was donated,
because there was no budget of education for the prison.
Now if I'd not done that,
it would have been a hellhole.
That's the second landmark.
I want to show you some moments of history in my journey,
which probably you would never ever get to see anywhere in the world.
One, the numbers you'll never get to see.
Secondly, this concept.
This was a meditation program inside the prison
of over 1,000 prisoners.
One thousand prisoners who sat in meditation.
This was one of the most courageous steps
I took as a prison governor.
And this is what transformed.
You want to know more about this,
go and see this film, "Doing Time, Doing Vipassana."
You will hear about it, and you will love it.
And write to me on KiranBedi.com,
and I'll respond to you.
Let me show you the next slide.
I took the same concept of mindfulness,
because, why did I bring meditation into the Indian prison?
Because crime is a product of a distorted mind.
It was distortion of mind which needed to be addressed to control.
Not by preaching, not by telling,
not by reading, but by addressing your mind.
I took the same thing to the police,
because police, equally, were prisoners of their minds,
and they felt as if it was "we" and "they,"
and that the people don't cooperate.
This worked.
This is a feedback box called a petition box.
This is a concept which I introduced
to listen to complaints, listen to grievances.
This was a magic box.
This was a sensitive box.
This is how a prisoner drew how they felt about the prison.
If you see somebody in the blue --
yeah, this guy --
he was a prisoner, and he was a teacher.
And you see, everybody's busy. There was no time to waste.
Let me wrap it up.
I'm currently into movements,
movements of education
of the under-served children,
which is thousands -- India is all about thousands.
Secondly is about the anti-corruption movement in India.
That's a big way
we, as a small group of activists,
have drafted an ombudsman bill for the government of India.
Friends, you will hear a lot about it.
That's the movement at the moment I'm driving,
and that's the movement and ambition of my life.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
So I wanted to tell a story
that really obsessed me when I was writing my new book,
and it's a story of something that happened
3,000 years ago,
when the Kingdom of Israel was in its infancy.
And it takes place in an area called the Shephelah
in what is now Israel.
And the reason the story obsessed me is that
I thought I understood it, and then I went back over it
and I realized that I didn't understand it at all.
Ancient Palestine had a -- along its eastern border,
there's a mountain range.
Still same is true of Israel today.
And in the mountain range are all of the ancient cities
of that region, so Jerusalem, Bethlehem, Hebron.
And then there's a coastal plain
along the Mediterranean, where Tel Aviv is now.
And connecting the mountain range with the coastal plain
is an area called the Shephelah,
which is a series of valleys and ridges that run east to west,
and you can follow the Shephelah, go through the Shephelah
to get from the coastal plain to the mountains.
And the Shephelah, if you've been to Israel, you'll know
it's just about the most beautiful part of Israel.
It's gorgeous, with forests of oak
and wheat fields and vineyards.
But more importantly, though, in the history of that region,
it's served, it's had a real strategic function,
and that is, it is the means by which hostile armies
on the coastal plain find their way,
get up into the mountains and threaten those living in the mountains.
And 3,000 years ago, that's exactly what happens.
The Philistines, who are the biggest of enemies
of the Kingdom of Israel,
are living in the coastal plain.
They're originally from Crete. They're a seafaring people.
And they may start to make their way
through one of the valleys of the Shephelah
up into the mountains,
because what they want to do is occupy the highland area
right by Bethlehem and split the Kingdom of Israel in two.
And the Kingdom of Israel, which is headed by King Saul,
obviously catches wind of this,
and Saul brings his army down from the mountains
and he confronts the Philistines in the Valley of Elah,
one of the most beautiful of the valleys of the Shephelah.
And the Israelites dig in along the northern ridge,
and the Philistines dig in along the southern ridge,
and the two armies just sit there for weeks
and stare at each other, because they're deadlocked.
Neither can attack the other, because to attack the other side
you've got to come down the mountain into the valley
and then up the other side, and you're completely exposed.
So finally, to break the deadlock,
the Philistines send their mightiest warrior
down into the valley floor, and he calls out
and he says to the Israelites,
"Send your mightiest warrior down,
and we'll have this out, just the two of us."
This was a tradition in ancient warfare called single combat.
It was a way of settling disputes
without incurring the bloodshed of a major battle.
And the Philistine who is sent down,
their mighty warrior, is a giant.
He's 6 foot 9.
He's outfitted head to toe in this glittering bronze armor,
and he's got a sword and he's got a javelin
and he's got his spear. He is absolutely terrifying.
And he's so terrifying that none of the Israelite soldiers want to fight him.
It's a death wish, right? There's no way they think they can take him.
And finally the only person who will come forward
is this young shepherd boy,
and he goes up to Saul and he says, "I'll fight him."
And Saul says, "You can't fight him. That's ridiculous.
You're this kid. This is this mighty warrior."
But the shepherd is adamant. He says, "No, no, no,
you don't understand, I have been defending my flock
against lions and wolves for years. I think I can do it."
And Saul has no choice. He's got no one else who's come forward.
So he says, "All right."
And then he turns to the kid, and he says,
"But you've got to wear this armor. You can't go as you are."
So he tries to give the shepherd his armor,
and the shepherd says, "No."
He says, "I can't wear this stuff."
The Biblical verse is, "I cannot wear this for I have not proved it,"
meaning, "I've never worn armor before. You've got to be crazy."
So he reaches down instead on the ground
and picks up five stones
and puts them in his shepherd's bag
and starts to walk down the mountainside to meet the giant.
And the giant sees this figure approaching,
and calls out, "Come to me so I can feed your flesh
to the birds of the heavens and the beasts of the field."
He issues this kind of taunt towards this person
coming to fight him.
And the shepherd draws closer and closer,
and the giant sees that he's carrying a staff.
That's all he's carrying.
Instead of a weapon, just this shepherd's staff,
and he says -- he's insulted --
"Am I a dog that you would come to me with sticks?"
And the shepherd boy takes one of his stones
out of his pocket, puts it in his sling
and rolls it around and lets it fly
and it hits the giant right between the eyes --
right here, in his most vulnerable spot --
and he falls down either dead or unconscious,
and the shepherd boy runs up and takes his sword
and cuts off his head,
and the Philistines see this and they turn and they just run.
And of course, the name of the giant is Goliath
and the name of the shepherd boy is David,
and the reason that story has obsessed me
over the course of writing my book
is that everything I thought I knew about that story
turned out to be wrong.
So David, in that story, is supposed to be the underdog, right?
In fact, that term, David and Goliath,
has entered our language as a metaphor for
improbable victories
by some weak party over someone far stronger.
Now why do we call David an underdog?
Well, we call him an underdog because he's a kid,
a little kid, and Goliath is this big, strong giant.
We also call him an underdog
because Goliath is an experienced warrior,
and David is just a shepherd.
But most importantly, we call him an underdog
because all he has is -- it's that Goliath is outfitted with
all of this modern weaponry,
this glittering coat of armor
and a sword and a javelin and a spear,
and all David has is this sling.
Well, let's start there with the phrase
"All David has is this sling,"
because that's the first mistake that we make.
In ancient warfare, there are three kinds of warriors.
There's cavalry, men on horseback and with chariots.
There's heavy infantry, which are foot soldiers,
armed foot soldiers with swords and shields
and some kind of armor.
And there's artillery, and artillery are archers,
but, more importantly, slingers.
And a slinger is someone who has a leather pouch
with two long cords attached to it,
and they put a projectile, either a rock or a lead ball,
inside the pouch, and they whirl it around like this
and they let one of the cords go,
and the effect is to send the projectile forward
towards its target.
That's what David has, and it's important to understand
that that sling is not a slingshot.
It's not this, right? It's not a child's toy.
It's in fact an incredibly devastating weapon.
When David rolls it around like this,
he's turning the sling around probably
at six or seven revolutions per second,
and that means that when the rock is released,
it's going forward really fast,
probably 35 meters per second.
That's substantially faster than a baseball
thrown by even the finest of baseball pitchers.
More than that, the stones in the Valley of Elah
were not normal rocks. They were barium sulphate,
which are rocks twice the density of normal stones.
If you do the calculations on the ballistics,
on the stopping power of the rock fired from David's sling,
it's roughly equal to the stopping power
of a [.45 caliber] handgun.
This is an incredibly devastating weapon.
Accuracy, we know from historical records
that slingers -- experienced slingers could hit
and maim or even kill a target at distances of up to 200 yards.
From medieval tapestries, we know that slingers
were capable of hitting birds in flight.
They were incredibly accurate.
When David lines up -- and he's not 200 yards away from Goliath,
he's quite close to Goliath --
when he lines up and fires that thing at Goliath,
he has every intention and every expectation
of being able to hit Goliath at his most vulnerable spot
between his eyes.
If you go back over the history of ancient warfare,
you will find time and time again
that slingers were the decisive factor against infantry
in one kind of battle or another.
So what's Goliath? He's heavy infantry,
and his expectation when he challenges the Israelites to a duel
is that he's going to be fighting another heavy infantryman.
When he says, "Come to me that I might
feed your flesh to the birds of the heavens and the beasts of the field,"
the key phrase is "Come to me."
Come up to me because we're going to fight,
hand to hand, like this.
Saul has the same expectation.
David says, "I want to fight Goliath,"
and Saul tries to give him his armor,
because Saul is thinking, "Oh, when you say 'fight Goliath,'
you mean 'fight him in hand-to-hand combat,'
infantry on infantry."
But David has absolutely no expectation.
He's not going to fight him that way. Why would he?
He's a shepherd. He's spent his entire career
using a sling to defend his flock against lions and wolves.
That's where his strength lies.
So here he is, this shepherd, experienced
in the use of a devastating weapon,
up against this lumbering giant
weighed down by a hundred pounds of armor
and these incredibly heavy weapons
that are useful only in short-range combat.
Goliath is a sitting duck. He doesn't have a chance.
So why do we keep calling David an underdog,
and why do we keep referring to his victory as improbable?
There's a second piece of this that's important.
It's not just that we misunderstand David
and his choice of weaponry.
It's also that we profoundly misunderstand Goliath.
Goliath is not what he seems to be.
There's all kinds of hints of this in the Biblical text,
things that are in retrospect quite puzzling
and don't square with his image as this mighty warrior.
So to begin with, the Bible says that Goliath
is led onto the valley floor by an attendant.
Now that is weird, right?
Here is this mighty warrior
challenging the Israelites to one-on-one combat.
Why is he being led by the hand
by some young boy, presumably,
to the point of combat?
Secondly, the Bible story makes special note
of how slowly Goliath moves,
another odd thing to say when you're describing
the mightiest warrior known to man at that point.
And then there's this whole weird thing
about how long it takes Goliath to react
to the sight of David.
So David's coming down the mountain,
and he's clearly not preparing for hand-to-hand combat.
There is nothing about him that says,
"I am about to fight you like this."
He's not even carrying a sword.
Why does Goliath not react to that?
It's as if he's oblivious to what's going on that day.
And then there's that strange comment he makes to David:
"Am I a dog that you should come to me with sticks?"
Sticks? David only has one stick.
Well, it turns out that there's been a great deal
of speculation within the medical community over the years
about whether there is something
fundamentally wrong with Goliath,
an attempt to make sense of all of those apparent anomalies.
There have been many articles written.
The first one was in 1960 in the Indiana Medical Journal,
and it started a chain of speculation
that starts with an explanation for Goliath's height.
So Goliath is head and shoulders above
all of his peers in that era,
and usually when someone is that far out of the norm,
there's an explanation for it.
So the most common form of giantism
is a condition called acromegaly,
and acromegaly is caused by a benign tumor
on your pituitary gland
that causes an overproduction of human growth hormone.
And throughout history, many of the most famous giants
have all had acromegaly.
So the tallest person of all time
was a guy named Robert Wadlow
who was still growing when he died at the age of 24
and he was 8 foot 11.
He had acromegaly.
Do you remember the wrestler André the Giant?
Famous. He had acromegaly.
There's even speculation that Abraham Lincoln had acromegaly.
Anyone who's unusually tall,
that's the first explanation we come up with.
And acromegaly has a very distinct set of side effects
associated with it,
principally having to do with vision.
The pituitary tumor, as it grows,
often starts to compress the visual nerves in your brain,
with the result that people with acromegaly
have either double vision or they are profoundly nearsighted.
So when people have started to speculate
about what might have been wrong with Goliath,
they've said, "Wait a minute,
he looks and sounds an awful lot like someone
who has acromegaly."
And that would also explain so much of what was strange
about his behavior that day.
Why does he move so slowly
and have to be escorted down into the valley floor
by an attendant?
Because he can't make his way on his own.
Why is he so strangely oblivious to David
that he doesn't understand that David's not going to fight him
until the very last moment?
Because he can't see him.
When he says, "Come to me that I might feed your flesh
to the birds of the heavens and the beasts of the field,"
the phrase "come to me" is a hint also of his vulnerability.
Come to me because I can't see you.
And then there's, "Am I a dog that you should come to me with sticks?"
He sees two sticks when David has only one.
So the Israelites up on the mountain ridge
looking down on him thought he was
this extraordinarily powerful foe.
What they didn't understand was that
the very thing that was the source of his apparent strength
was also the source of his greatest weakness.
And there is, I think, in that,
a very important lesson for all of us.
Giants are not as strong and powerful as they seem.
And sometimes the shepherd boy has a sling in his pocket.
Thank you.
(Applause)
So it's 1995,
I'm in college,
and a friend and I go on a road trip
from Providence, Rhode Island
to Portland, Oregon.
And you know, we're young and unemployed,
so we do the whole thing on back roads
through state parks
and national forests --
basically the longest route we can possibly take.
And somewhere in the middle of South Dakota,
I turn to my friend
and I ask her a question
that's been bothering me
for 2,000 miles.
"What's up with the Chinese character I keep seeing by the side of the road?"
My friend looks at me totally blankly.
There's actually a gentleman in the front row
who's doing a perfect imitation of her look.
(Laughter)
And I'm like, "You know,
all the signs we keep seeing
with the Chinese character on them."
She just stares at me for a few moments,
and then she cracks up,
because she figures out what I'm talking about.
And what I'm talking about is this.
(Laughter)
Right, the famous Chinese character for picnic area.
(Laughter)
I've spent the last five years of my life
thinking about situations
exactly like this --
why we sometimes misunderstand
the signs around us,
and how we behave when that happens,
and what all of this can tell us about human nature.
In other words, as you heard Chris say,
I've spent the last five years
thinking about being wrong.
This might strike you as a strange career move,
but it actually has one great advantage:
no job competition.
(Laughter)
In fact, most of us do everything we can
to avoid thinking about being wrong,
or at least to avoid thinking about the possibility
that we ourselves are wrong.
We get it in the abstract.
We all know everybody in this room makes mistakes.
The human species, in general, is fallible -- okay fine.
But when it comes down to me, right now,
to all the beliefs I hold,
here in the present tense,
suddenly all of this abstract appreciation of fallibility
goes out the window --
and I can't actually think of anything I'm wrong about.
And the thing is, the present tense is where we live.
We go to meetings in the present tense;
we go on family vacations in the present tense;
we go to the polls and vote in the present tense.
So effectively, we all kind of wind up traveling through life,
trapped in this little bubble
of feeling very right about everything.
I think this is a problem.
I think it's a problem for each of us as individuals,
in our personal and professional lives,
and I think it's a problem for all of us collectively as a culture.
So what I want to do today
is, first of all, talk about why we get stuck
inside this feeling of being right.
And second, why it's such a problem.
And finally, I want to convince you
that it is possible
to step outside of that feeling
and that if you can do so,
it is the single greatest
moral, intellectual and creative leap you can make.
So why do we get stuck
in this feeling of being right?
One reason, actually, has to do with a feeling of being wrong.
So let me ask you guys something --
or actually, let me ask you guys something, because you're right here:
How does it feel -- emotionally --
how does it feel to be wrong?
Dreadful. Thumbs down.
Embarrassing. Okay, wonderful, great.
Dreadful, thumbs down, embarrassing --
thank you, these are great answers,
but they're answers to a different question.
You guys are answering the question:
How does it feel to realize you're wrong?
(Laughter)
Realizing you're wrong can feel like all of that and a lot of other things, right?
I mean it can be devastating, it can be revelatory,
it can actually be quite funny,
like my stupid Chinese character mistake.
But just being wrong
doesn't feel like anything.
I'll give you an analogy.
Do you remember that Loony Tunes cartoon
where there's this pathetic coyote
who's always chasing and never catching a roadrunner?
In pretty much every episode of this cartoon,
there's a moment where the coyote is chasing the roadrunner
and the roadrunner runs off a cliff,
which is fine -- he's a bird, he can fly.
But the thing is, the coyote runs off the cliff right after him.
And what's funny --
at least if you're six years old --
is that the coyote's totally fine too.
He just keeps running --
right up until the moment that he looks down
and realizes that he's in mid-air.
That's when he falls.
When we're wrong about something --
not when we realize it, but before that --
we're like that coyote
after he's gone off the cliff and before he looks down.
You know, we're already wrong,
we're already in trouble,
but we feel like we're on solid ground.
So I should actually correct something I said a moment ago.
It does feel like something to be wrong;
it feels like being right.
(Laughter)
So this is one reason, a structural reason,
why we get stuck inside this feeling of rightness.
I call this error blindness.
Most of the time,
we don't have any kind of internal cue
to let us know that we're wrong about something,
until it's too late.
But there's a second reason that we get stuck inside this feeling as well --
and this one is cultural.
Think back for a moment to elementary school.
You're sitting there in class,
and your teacher is handing back quiz papers,
and one of them looks like this.
This is not mine, by the way.
(Laughter)
So there you are in grade school,
and you know exactly what to think
about the kid who got this paper.
It's the dumb kid, the troublemaker,
the one who never does his homework.
So by the time you are nine years old,
you've already learned, first of all,
that people who get stuff wrong
are lazy, irresponsible dimwits --
and second of all,
that the way to succeed in life
is to never make any mistakes.
We learn these really bad lessons really well.
And a lot of us --
and I suspect, especially a lot of us in this room --
deal with them by just becoming
perfect little A students,
perfectionists, over-achievers.
Right,
Mr. CFO, astrophysicist, ultra-marathoner?
(Laughter)
You're all CFO, astrophysicists, ultra-marathoners, it turns out.
Okay, so fine.
Except that then we freak out
at the possibility that we've gotten something wrong.
Because according to this,
getting something wrong
means there's something wrong with us.
So we just insist that we're right,
because it makes us feel smart and responsible
and virtuous and safe.
So let me tell you a story.
A couple of years ago,
a woman comes into Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center for a surgery.
Beth Israel's in Boston.
It's the teaching hospital for Harvard --
one of the best hospitals in the country.
So this woman comes in and she's taken into the operating room.
She's anesthetized, the surgeon does his thing --
stitches her back up, sends her out to the recovery room.
Everything seems to have gone fine.
And she wakes up, and she looks down at herself,
and she says, "Why is the wrong side of my body in bandages?"
Well the wrong side of her body is in bandages
because the surgeon has performed a major operation
on her left leg instead of her right one.
When the vice president for health care quality at Beth Israel
spoke about this incident,
he said something very interesting.
He said, "For whatever reason,
the surgeon simply felt
that he was on the correct side of the patient."
(Laughter)
The point of this story
is that trusting too much in the feeling
of being on the correct side of anything
can be very dangerous.
This internal sense of rightness
that we all experience so often
is not a reliable guide
to what is actually going on in the external world.
And when we act like it is,
and we stop entertaining the possibility that we could be wrong,
well that's when we end up doing things
like dumping 200 million gallons of oil into the Gulf of Mexico,
or torpedoing the global economy.
So this is a huge practical problem.
But it's also a huge social problem.
Think for a moment about what it means to feel right.
It means that you think that your beliefs
just perfectly reflect reality.
And when you feel that way,
you've got a problem to solve,
which is, how are you going to explain
all of those people who disagree with you?
It turns out, most of us explain those people the same way,
by resorting to a series of unfortunate assumptions.
The first thing we usually do when someone disagrees with us
is we just assume they're ignorant.
They don't have access to the same information that we do,
and when we generously share that information with them,
they're going to see the light and come on over to our team.
When that doesn't work,
when it turns out those people have all the same facts that we do
and they still disagree with us,
then we move on to a second assumption,
which is that they're idiots.
(Laughter)
They have all the right pieces of the puzzle,
and they are too moronic to put them together correctly.
And when that doesn't work,
when it turns out that people who disagree with us
have all the same facts we do
and are actually pretty smart,
then we move on to a third assumption:
they know the truth,
and they are deliberately distorting it
for their own malevolent purposes.
So this is a catastrophe.
This attachment to our own rightness
keeps us from preventing mistakes
when we absolutely need to
and causes us to treat each other terribly.
But to me, what's most baffling
and most tragic about this
is that it misses the whole point of being human.
It's like we want to imagine
that our minds are just these perfectly translucent windows
and we just gaze out of them
and describe the world as it unfolds.
And we want everybody else to gaze out of the same window
and see the exact same thing.
That is not true,
and if it were, life would be incredibly boring.
The miracle of your mind
isn't that you can see the world as it is.
It's that you can see the world as it isn't.
We can remember the past,
and we can think about the future,
and we can imagine what it's like
to be some other person in some other place.
And we all do this a little differently,
which is why we can all look up at the same night sky
and see this
and also this
and also this.
And yeah, it is also why we get things wrong.
1,200 years before Descartes said his famous thing
about "I think therefore I am,"
this guy, St. Augustine, sat down
and wrote "Fallor ergo sum" --
"I err therefore I am."
Augustine understood
that our capacity to screw up,
it's not some kind of embarrassing defect
in the human system,
something we can eradicate or overcome.
It's totally fundamental to who we are.
Because, unlike God,
we don't really know what's going on out there.
And unlike all of the other animals,
we are obsessed with trying to figure it out.
To me, this obsession
is the source and root
of all of our productivity and creativity.
Last year, for various reasons,
I found myself listening to a lot of episodes
of the Public Radio show This American Life.
And so I'm listening and I'm listening,
and at some point, I start feeling
like all the stories are about being wrong.
And my first thought was,
"I've lost it.
I've become the crazy wrongness lady.
I just imagined it everywhere,"
which has happened.
But a couple of months later,
I actually had a chance to interview Ira Glass, who's the host of the show.
And I mentioned this to him,
and he was like, "No actually, that's true.
In fact," he says,
"as a staff, we joke
that every single episode of our show
has the same crypto-theme.
And the crypto-theme is:
'I thought this one thing was going to happen
and something else happened instead.'
And the thing is," says Ira Glass, "we need this.
We need these moments
of surprise and reversal and wrongness
to make these stories work."
And for the rest of us, audience members,
as listeners, as readers,
we eat this stuff up.
We love things like plot twists
and red herrings and surprise endings.
When it comes to our stories,
we love being wrong.
But, you know, our stories are like this
because our lives are like this.
We think this one thing is going to happen
and something else happens instead.
George Bush thought he was going to invade Iraq,
find a bunch of weapons of mass destruction,
liberate the people and bring democracy to the Middle East.
And something else happened instead.
And Hosni Mubarak
thought he was going to be the dictator of Egypt for the rest of his life,
until he got too old or too sick
and could pass the reigns of power onto his son.
And something else happened instead.
And maybe you thought
you were going to grow up and marry your high school sweetheart
and move back to your hometown and raise a bunch of kids together.
And something else happened instead.
And I have to tell you
that I thought I was writing an incredibly nerdy book
about a subject everybody hates
for an audience that would never materialize.
And something else happened instead.
(Laughter)
I mean, this is life.
For good and for ill,
we generate these incredible stories
about the world around us,
and then the world turns around and astonishes us.
No offense, but this entire conference
is an unbelievable monument
to our capacity to get stuff wrong.
We just spent an entire week
talking about innovations and advancements
and improvements,
but you know why we need all of those innovations
and advancements and improvements?
Because half the stuff
that's the most mind-boggling and world-altering --
TED 1998 --
eh.
(Laughter)
Didn't really work out that way, did it?
(Laughter)
Where's my jet pack, Chris?
(Laughter)
(Applause)
So here we are again.
And that's how it goes.
We come up with another idea.
We tell another story.
We hold another conference.
The theme of this one,
as you guys have now heard seven million times,
is the rediscovery of wonder.
And to me,
if you really want to rediscover wonder,
you need to step outside
of that tiny, terrified space of rightness
and look around at each other
and look out at the vastness
and complexity and mystery
of the universe
and be able to say,
"Wow, I don't know.
Maybe I'm wrong."
Thank you.
(Applause)
Thank you guys.
(Applause)
My colleagues and I are fascinated
by the science of moving dots.
So what are these dots?
Well, it's all of us.
And we're moving in our homes,
in our offices, as we shop and travel
throughout our cities
and around the world.
And wouldn't it be great
if we could understand all this movement?
If we could find patterns and meaning
and insight in it.
And luckily for us, we live in a time
where we're incredibly good
at capturing information about ourselves.
So whether it's through
sensors or videos, or apps,
we can track our movement
with incredibly fine detail.
So it turns out one of the places
where we have the best data about movement
is sports.
So whether it's basketball or baseball,
or football or the other football,
we're instrumenting our stadiums
and our players to track their movements
every fraction of a second.
So what we're doing
is turning our athletes into --
you probably guessed it --
moving dots.
So we've got mountains of moving dots
and like most raw data,
it's hard to deal with
and not that interesting.
But there are things that, for example,
basketball coaches want to know.
And the problem is they can't know them
because they'd have to watch every second
of every game, remember it and process it.
And a person can't do that,
but a machine can.
The problem is a machine can't see
the game with the eye of a coach.
At least they couldn't until now.
So what have we taught the machine to see?
So, we started simply.
We taught it things like passes,
shots and rebounds.
Things that most casual fans would know.
And then we moved on to things
slightly more complicated.
Events like post-ups,
and pick-and-rolls, and isolations.
And if you don't know them, that's okay.
Most casual players probably do.
Now, we've gotten to a point where today,
the machine understands complex events
like down screens and wide pins.
Basically things only professionals know.
So we have taught a machine to see
with the eyes of a coach.
So how have we been able to do this?
If I asked a coach to describe
something like a pick-and-roll,
they would give me a description,
and if I encoded that as an algorithm,
it would be terrible.
The pick-and-roll happens to be this dance
in basketball between four players,
two on offense and two on defense.
And here's kind of how it goes.
So there's the guy on offense
without the ball
the ball and he goes next to the guy
guarding the guy with the ball,
and he kind of stays there
and they both move and stuff happens,
and ta-da, it's a pick-and-roll.
(Laughter)
So that is also an example
of a terrible algorithm.
So, if the player who's the interferer --
he's called the screener --
goes close by, but he doesn't stop,
it's probably not a pick-and-roll.
Or if he does stop,
but he doesn't stop close enough,
it's probably not a pick-and-roll.
Or, if he does go close by
and he does stop
but they do it under the basket,
it's probably not a pick-and-roll.
Or I could be wrong,
they could all be pick-and-rolls.
It really depends on the exact timing,
the distances, the locations,
and that's what makes it hard.
So, luckily, with machine learning,
we can go beyond our own ability
to describe the things we know.
So how does this work?
Well, it's by example.
So we go to the machine and say,
"Good morning, machine.
Here are some pick-and-rolls,
and here are some things that are not.
Please find a way to tell the difference."
And the key to all of this is to find
features that enable it to separate.
So if I was going
to teach it the difference
between an apple and orange,
I might say, "Why don't you
use color or shape?"
And the problem that we're solving is,
what are those things?
What are the key features
that let a computer navigate
the world of moving dots?
So figuring out all these relationships
with relative and absolute location,
distance, timing, velocities --
that's really the key to the science
of moving dots, or as we like to call it,
spatiotemporal pattern recognition,
in academic vernacular.
Because the first thing is,
you have to make it sound hard --
because it is.
The key thing is, for NBA coaches,
it's not that they want to know
whether a pick-and-roll happened or not.
It's that they want to know
how it happened.
And why is it so important to them?
So here's a little insight.
It turns out in modern basketball,
this pick-and-roll is perhaps
the most important play.
And knowing how to run it,
and knowing how to defend it,
is basically a key to winning
and losing most games.
So it turns out that this dance
has a great many variations
and identifying the variations
is really the thing that matters,
and that's why we need this
to be really, really good.
So, here's an example.
There are two offensive
and two defensive players,
getting ready to do
the pick-and-roll dance.
So the guy with ball
can either take, or he can reject.
His teammate can either roll or pop.
The guy guarding the ball
can either go over or under.
His teammate can either show
or play up to touch, or play soft
and together they can
either switch or blitz
and I didn't know
most of these things when I started
and it would be lovely if everybody moved
according to those arrows.
It would make our lives a lot easier,
but it turns out movement is very messy.
People wiggle a lot and getting
these variations identified
with very high accuracy,
both in precision and recall, is tough
because that's what it takes to get
a professional coach to believe in you.
And despite all the difficulties
with the right spatiotemporal features
we have been able to do that.
Coaches trust our ability of our machine
to identify these variations.
We're at the point where
almost every single contender
for an NBA championship this year
is using our software, which is built
on a machine that understands
the moving dots of basketball.
So not only that, we have given advice
that has changed strategies
that have helped teams win
very important games,
and it's very exciting because you have
coaches who've been in the league
for 30 years that are willing to take
advice from a machine.
And it's very exciting,
it's much more than the pick-and-roll.
Our computer started out
with simple things
and learned more and more complex things
and now it knows so many things.
Frankly, I don't understand
much of what it does,
and while it's not that special
to be smarter than me,
we were wondering,
can a machine know more than a coach?
Can it know more than person could know?
And it turns out the answer is yes.
The coaches want players
to take good shots.
So if I'm standing near the basket
and there's nobody near me,
it's a good shot.
If I'm standing far away surrounded
by defenders, that's generally a bad shot.
But we never knew how good "good" was,
or how bad "bad" was quantitatively.
Until now.
So what we can do, again,
using spatiotemporal features,
we looked at every shot.
We can see: Where is the shot?
What's the angle to the basket?
Where are the defenders standing?
What are their distances?
What are their angles?
For multiple defenders, we can look
at how the player's moving
and predict the shot type.
We can look at all their velocities
and we can build a model that predicts
what is the likelihood that this shot
would go in under these circumstances?
So why is this important?
We can take something that was shooting,
which was one thing before,
and turn it into two things:
the quality of the shot
and the quality of the shooter.
So here's a bubble chart,
because what's TED without a bubble chart?
(Laughter)
Those are NBA players.
The size is the size of the player
and the color is the position.
On the x-axis,
we have the shot probability.
People on the left take difficult shots,
on the right, they take easy shots.
On the [y-axis] is their shooting ability.
People who are good are at the top,
bad at the bottom.
So for example, if there was a player
who generally made
47 percent of their shots,
that's all you knew before.
But today, I can tell you that player
takes shots that an average NBA player
would make 49 percent of the time,
and they are two percent worse.
And the reason that's important
is that there are lots of 47s out there.
And so it's really important to know
if the 47 that you're considering
giving 100 million dollars to
is a good shooter who takes bad shots
or a bad shooter who takes good shots.
Machine understanding doesn't just change
how we look at players,
it changes how we look at the game.
So there was this very exciting game
a couple of years ago, in the NBA finals.
Miami was down by three,
there was 20 seconds left.
They were about to lose the championship.
A gentleman named LeBron James
came up and he took a three to tie.
He missed.
His teammate Chris Bosh got a rebound,
passed it to another teammate
named Ray Allen.
He sank a three. It went into overtime.
They won the game.
They won the championship.
It was one of the most exciting
games in basketball.
And our ability to know
the shot probability for every player
at every second,
and the likelihood of them getting
a rebound at every second
can illuminate this moment in a way
that we never could before.
Now unfortunately,
I can't show you that video.
But for you, we recreated that moment
at our weekly basketball game
about 3 weeks ago.
(Laughter)
And we recreated the tracking
that led to the insights.
So, here is us.
This is Chinatown in Los Angeles,
a park we play at every week,
and that's us recreating
the Ray Allen moment
and all the tracking
that's associated with it.
So, here's the shot.
I'm going to show you that moment
and all the insights of that moment.
The only difference is, instead
of the professional players, it's us,
and instead of a professional
announcer, it's me.
So, bear with me.
Miami.
Down three.
Twenty seconds left.
Jeff brings up the ball.
Josh catches, puts up a three!
[Calculating shot probability]
[Shot quality]
[Rebound probability]
Won't go!
[Rebound probability]
Rebound, Noel.
Back to Daria.
[Shot quality]
Her three-pointer -- bang!
Tie game with five seconds left.
The crowd goes wild.
(Laughter)
That's roughly how it happened.
(Applause)
Roughly.
(Applause)
That moment had about a nine percent
chance of happening in the NBA
and we know that
and a great many other things.
I'm not going to tell you how many times
it took us to make that happen.
(Laughter)
Okay, I will! It was four.
(Laughter)
Way to go, Daria.
But the important thing about that video
and the insights we have for every second
of every NBA game -- it's not that.
It's the fact you don't have to be
a professional team to track movement.
You do not have to be a professional
player to get insights about movement.
In fact, it doesn't even have to be about
sports because we're moving everywhere.
We're moving in our homes,
in our offices,
as we shop and we travel
throughout our cities
and around our world.
What will we know? What will we learn?
Perhaps, instead of identifying
pick-and-rolls,
a machine can identify
the moment and let me know
when my daughter takes her first steps.
Which could literally be happening
any second now.
Perhaps we can learn to better use
our buildings, better plan our cities.
I believe that with the development
of the science of moving dots,
we will move better, we will move smarter,
we will move forward.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
I've been working on issues of poverty for more than 20 years,
and so it's ironic that the problem that and question that I most grapple with
is how you actually define poverty. What does it mean?
So often, we look at dollar terms --
people making less than a dollar or two or three a day.
And yet the complexity of poverty really has to look at
income as only one variable.
Because really, it's a condition about choice,
and the lack of freedom.
And I had an experience that really deepened and elucidated for me
the understanding that I have.
It was in Kenya, and I want to share it with you.
I was with my friend Susan Meiselas, the photographer,
in the Mathare Valley slums.
Now, Mathare Valley is one of the oldest slums in Africa.
It's about three miles out of Nairobi,
and it's a mile long and about two-tenths of a mile wide,
where over half a million people
live crammed in these little tin shacks,
generation after generation, renting them,
often eight or 10 people to a room.
And it's known for prostitution, violence, drugs:
a hard place to grow up.
And when we were walking through the narrow alleys,
it was literally impossible not to step in the
raw sewage and the garbage alongside the little homes.
But at the same time it was also
impossible not to see the human vitality,
the aspiration and the ambition of the people who live there:
women washing their babies, washing their clothes, hanging them out to dry.
I met this woman, Mama Rose,
who has rented that little tin shack for 32 years,
where she lives with her seven children.
Four sleep in one twin bed,
and three sleep on the mud and linoleum floor.
And she keeps them all in school by selling water from that kiosk,
and from selling soap and bread from the little store inside.
It was also the day after the inauguration,
and I was reminded how Mathare is still connected to the globe.
And I would see kids on the street corners,
and they'd say "Obama, he's our brother!"
And I'd say "Well, Obama's my brother, so that makes you my brother too."
And they would look quizzically, and then be like, "High five!"
And it was here that I met Jane.
I was struck immediately by the kindness and the gentleness in her face,
and I asked her to tell me her story.
She started off by telling me her dream. She said, "I had two.
My first dream was to be a doctor,
and the second was to marry a good man
who would stay with me and my family,
because my mother was a single mom,
and couldn't afford to pay for school fees.
So I had to give up the first dream, and I focused on the second."
She got married when she was 18, had a baby right away.
And when she turned 20, found herself pregnant with a second child,
her mom died and her husband left her -- married another woman.
So she was again in Mathare, with no income, no skill set, no money.
And so she ultimately turned to prostitution.
It wasn't organized in the way we often think of it.
She would go into the city at night with about 20 girls,
look for work, and sometimes come back with a few shillings,
or sometimes with nothing.
And she said, "You know, the poverty wasn't so bad. It was the humiliation
and the embarrassment of it all."
In 2001, her life changed.
She had a girlfriend who had heard about this organization, Jamii Bora,
that would lend money to people no matter how poor you were,
as long as you provided a commensurate amount in savings.
And so she spent a year to save 50 dollars,
and started borrowing, and over time she was able to buy a sewing machine.
She started tailoring.
And that turned into what she does now,
which is to go into the secondhand clothing markets,
and for about three dollars and 25 cents she buys an old ball gown.
Some of them might be ones you gave.
And she repurposes them with frills and ribbons,
and makes these frothy confections that she sells to women
for their daughter's Sweet 16 or first Holy Communion --
those milestones in a life that people want to celebrate
all along the economic spectrum.
And she does really good business. In fact, I watched her
walk through the streets hawking. And before you knew it,
there was a crowd of women around her, buying these dresses.
And I reflected, as I was watching her sell the dresses,
and also the jewelry that she makes,
that now Jane makes more than four dollars a day.
And by many definitions she is no longer poor.
But she still lives in Mathare Valley.
And so she can't move out.
She lives with all of that insecurity,
and in fact, in January, during the ethnic riots,
she was chased from her home and had to find a new shack
in which she would live.
Jamii Bora understands that and understands
that when we're talking about poverty,
we've got to look at people all along the economic spectrum.
And so with patient capital from Acumen and other organizations,
loans and investments that will go the long term with them,
they built a low-cost housing development,
about an hour outside Nairobi central.
And they designed it from the perspective of
customers like Jane herself,
insisting on responsibility and accountability.
So she has to give 10 percent of the mortgage --
of the total value, or about 400 dollars in savings.
And then they match her mortgage to what she paid in rent for her little shanty.
And in the next couple of weeks, she's going to be
among the first 200 families to move into this development.
When I asked her if she feared anything,
or whether she would miss anything from Mathare,
she said, "What would I fear
that I haven't confronted already?
I'm HIV positive. I've dealt with it all."
And she said, "What would I miss?
You think I will miss the violence or the drugs? The lack of privacy?
Do you think I'll miss not knowing if my children are going to come home
at the end of the day?" She said "If you gave me 10 minutes
my bags would be packed."
I said, "Well what about your dreams?"
And she said, "Well, you know,
my dreams don't look exactly like I thought they would when I was a little girl.
But if I think about it, I thought I wanted a husband,
but what I really wanted was a family
that was loving. And I fiercely love my children, and they love me back."
She said, "I thought that I wanted to be a doctor,
but what I really wanted to be was somebody
who served and healed and cured.
And so I feel so blessed with everything that I have,
that two days a week I go and I counsel HIV patients.
And I say, 'Look at me. You are not dead.
You are still alive. And if you are still alive you have to serve.'"
And she said, "I'm not a doctor who gives out pills.
But maybe me, I give out something better
because I give them hope."
And in the middle of this economic crisis,
where so many of us are inclined to pull in
with fear, I think we're well suited to
take a cue from Jane and reach out,
recognizing that being poor doesn't mean being ordinary.
Because when systems are broken,
like the ones that we're seeing around the world,
it's an opportunity for invention and for innovation.
It's an opportunity to truly build a world
where we can extend services and products
to all human beings, so that they can
make decisions and choices for themselves.
I truly believe it's where dignity starts.
We owe it to the Janes of the world.
And just as important, we owe it to ourselves.
Thank you.
(Applause)
For the last year,
everyone's been watching the same show,
and I'm not talking
about "Game of Thrones,"
but a horrifying, real-life drama
that's proved too fascinating to turn off.
It's a show produced by murderers
and shared around the world
via the Internet.
Their names have become familiar:
James Foley, Steven Sotloff,
David Haines, Alan Henning, Peter Kassig,
Haruna Yukawa, Kenji Goto Jogo.
Their beheadings by the Islamic State
were barbaric,
but if we think they were archaic,
from a remote, obscure age,
then we're wrong.
They were uniquely modern,
because the murderers acted knowing well
that millions of people
would tune in to watch.
The headlines called them
savages and barbarians,
because the image of one man
overpowering another,
killing him with a knife to the throat,
conforms to our idea
of ancient, primitive practices,
the polar opposite
of our urban, civilized ways.
We don't do things like that.
But that's the irony.
We think a beheading
has nothing to do with us,
even as we click on the screen to watch.
But it is to do with us.
The Islamic State beheadings
are not ancient or remote.
They're a global, 21st century event,
a 21st century event that takes place
in our living rooms, at our desks,
on our computer screens.
They're entirely dependent
on the power of technology to connect us.
And whether we like it or not,
everyone who watches
is a part of the show.
And lots of people watch.
We don't know exactly how many.
Obviously, it's difficult to calculate.
But a poll taken in the UK,
for example, in August 2014,
estimated that 1.2 million people
had watched the beheading of James Foley
in the few days after it was released.
And that's just the first few days,
and just Britain.
A similar poll taken in the United States
in November 2014
found that nine percent of those surveyed
had watched beheading videos,
and a further 23 percent
had watched the videos but had stopped
just before the death was shown.
Nine percent may be a small minority
of all the people who could watch,
but it's still a very large crowd.
And of course that crowd
is growing all the time,
because every week, every month,
more people will keep downloading
and keep watching.
If we go back 11 years,
before sites like YouTube
and Facebook were born,
it was a similar story.
When innocent civilians like Daniel Pearl,
Nick Berg, Paul Johnson, were beheaded,
those videos were shown
during the Iraq War.
Nick Berg's beheading
quickly became one of the most
searched for items on the Internet.
Within a day, it was the top search term
across search engines
like Google, Lycos, Yahoo.
In the week after Nick Berg's beheading,
these were the top 10 search terms
in the United States.
The Berg beheading video remained
the most popular search term for a week,
and it was the second most popular
search term for the whole month of May,
runner-up only to "American Idol."
The al-Qaeda-linked website
that first showed Nick Berg's beheading
had to close down within a couple of days
due to overwhelming traffic to the site.
One Dutch website owner said
that his daily viewing figures
rose from 300,000 to 750,000
every time a beheading in Iraq was shown.
He told reporters 18 months later
that it had been downloaded
many millions of times,
and that's just one website.
A similar pattern was seen again and again
when videos of beheadings
were released during the Iraq War.
Social media sites have made these images
more accessible than ever before,
but if we take
another step back in history,
we'll see that it was the camera
that first created a new kind of crowd
in our history of beheadings
as public spectacle.
As soon as the camera
appeared on the scene,
a full lifetime ago on June 17, 1939,
it had an immediate
and unequivocal effect.
That day, the first film of a public
beheading was created in France.
It was the execution, the guillotining,
of a German serial killer, Eugen Weidmann,
outside the prison
Saint-Pierre in Versailles.
Weidmann was due to be executed
at the crack of dawn,
as was customary at the time,
but his executioner was new to the job,
and he'd underestimated
how long it would take him to prepare.
So Weidmann was executed
at 4:30 in the morning,
by which time on a June morning,
there was enough light
to take photographs,
and a spectator in the crowd
filmed the event,
unbeknownst to the authorities.
Several still photographs
were taken as well,
and you can still watch
the film online today
and look at the photographs.
The crowd on the day
of Weidmann's execution
was called "unruly"
and "disgusting" by the press,
but that was nothing compared
to the untold thousands of people
who could now study the action
over and over again,
freeze-framed in every detail.
The camera may have made these scenes
more accessible than ever before,
but it's not just about the camera.
If we take a bigger leap back in history,
we'll see that for as long
as there have been
public judicial executions and beheadings,
there have been the crowds to see them.
In London, as late as
the early 19th century,
there might be four or five thousand
people to see a standard hanging.
There could be 40,000 or 50,000
to see a famous criminal killed.
And a beheading, which was
a rare event in England at the time,
attracted even more.
In May 1820,
five men known as
the Cato Street Conspirators
were executed in London for plotting
to assassinate members
of the British government.
They were hung and then decapitated.
It was a gruesome scene.
Each man's head was hacked off in turn
and held up to the crowd.
And 100,000 people,
that's 10,000 more than can fit
into Wembley Stadium,
had turned out to watch.
The streets were packed.
People had rented out
windows and rooftops.
People had climbed onto carts
and wagons in the street.
People climbed lamp posts.
People had been known to have died
in the crush on popular execution days.
Evidence suggests
that throughout our history
of public beheadings
and public executions,
the vast majority of the people
who come to see
are either enthusiastic
or, at best, unmoved.
Disgust has been comparatively rare,
and even when people
are disgusted and are horrified,
it doesn't always stop them
from coming out all the same to watch.
Perhaps the most striking example
of the human ability to watch
a beheading and remain unmoved
and even be disappointed
was the introduction in France
in 1792 of the guillotine,
that famous decapitation machine.
To us in the 21st century,
the guillotine may seem
like a monstrous contraption,
but to the first crowds who saw it,
it was actually a disappointment.
They were used to seeing long, drawn-out,
torturous executions on the scaffold,
where people were mutilated
and burned and pulled apart slowly.
To them, watching
the guillotine in action,
it was so quick, there was nothing to see.
The blade fell, the head fell
into a basket, out of sight immediately,
and they called out,
"Give me back my gallows,
give me back my wooden gallows."
The end of torturous public
judicial executions in Europe and America
was partly to do with being
more humane towards the criminal,
but it was also partly because the crowd
obstinately refused to behave
in the way that they should.
All too often, execution day
was more like a carnival
than a solemn ceremony.
Today, a public judicial execution
in Europe or America is unthinkable,
but there are other scenarios
that should make us cautious
about thinking
that things are different now
and we don't behave like that anymore.
Take, for example,
the incidents of suicide baiting.
This is when a crowd gathers
to watch a person who has climbed
to the top of a public building
in order to kill themselves,
and people in the crowd shout and jeer,
"Get on with it! Go on and jump!"
This is a well-recognized phenomenon.
One paper in 1981 found that in 10
out of 21 threatened suicide attempts,
there was incidents of suicide baiting
and jeering from a crowd.
And there have been incidents
reported in the press this year.
This was a very widely reported incident
in Telford and Shropshire
in March this year.
And when it happens today,
people take photographs
and they take videos on their phones
and they post those videos online.
When it comes to brutal murderers
who post their beheading videos,
the Internet has created
a new kind of crowd.
Today, the action takes place
in a distant time and place,
which gives the viewer a sense
of detachment from what's happening,
a sense of separation.
It's nothing to do with me.
It's already happened.
We are also offered
an unprecedented sense of intimacy.
Today, we are all offered front row seats.
We can all watch in private,
in our own time and space,
and no one need ever know
that we've clicked on the screen to watch.
This sense of separation --
from other people,
from the event itself --
seems to be key to understanding
our ability to watch,
and there are several ways
in which the Internet
creates a sense of detachment
that seems to erode
individual moral responsibility.
Our activities online
are often contrasted with real life,
as though the things we do online
are somehow less real.
We feel less accountable for our actions
when we interact online.
There's a sense of anonymity,
a sense of invisibility,
so we feel less accountable
for our behavior.
The Internet also makes it far easier
to stumble upon things inadvertently,
things that we would usually avoid
in everyday life.
Today, a video can start playing
before you even know what you're watching.
Or you may be tempted to look at material
that you wouldn't look at in everyday life
or you wouldn't look at if you
were with other people at the time.
And when the action is pre-recorded
and takes place
in a distant time and space,
watching seems like a passive activity.
There's nothing I can do about it now.
It's already happened.
All these things make it easier
as an Internet user
for us to give in to our sense
of curiosity about death,
to push our personal boundaries,
to test our sense of shock,
to explore our sense of shock.
But we're not passive when we watch.
On the contrary, we're fulfilling
the murderer's desire to be seen.
When the victim of a decapitation
is bound and defenseless,
he or she essentially becomes
a pawn in their killer's show.
Unlike a trophy head
that's taken in battle,
that represents the luck and skill
it takes to win a fight,
when a beheading is staged,
when it's essentially a piece of theater,
the power comes from the reception
the killer receives as he performs.
In other words, watching
is very much part of the event.
The event no longer takes place
in a single location
at a certain point in time as it used to
and as it may still appear to.
Now the event is stretched out
in time and place,
and everyone who watches plays their part.
We should stop watching,
but we know we won't.
History tells us we won't,
and the killers know it too.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Bruno Giussani: Thank you.
Let me get this back. Thank you.
Let's move here. While they install
for the next performance,
I want to ask you the question
that probably many here have,
which is how did you
get interested in this topic?
Frances Larson: I used to work at a museum
called the Pitt Rivers Museum in Oxford,
which was famous for its display
of shrunken heads from South America.
People used to say, "Oh, the shrunken head
museum, the shrunken head museum!"
And at the time,
I was working on the history
of scientific collections of skulls.
I was working on the cranial collections,
and it just struck me as ironic
that here were people coming to see
this gory, primitive, savage culture
that they were almost
fantasizing about and creating
without really understanding
what they were seeing,
and all the while these vast --
I mean hundreds of thousands
of skulls in our museums,
all across Europe and the States --
were kind of upholding this Enlightenment
pursuit of scientific rationality.
So I wanted to kind of twist it round
and say, "Let's look at us."
We're looking through the glass case
at these shrunken heads.
Let's look at our own history and our own
cultural fascination with these things.
BG: Thank you for sharing that.
FL: Thank you.
(Applause)
I want to introduce you
to an amazing woman.
Her name is Davinia.
Davinia was born in Jamaica,
emigrated to the US at the age of 18,
and now lives just outside
of Washington, DC.
She's not a high-powered
political staffer,
nor a lobbyist.
She'd probably tell you
she's quite unremarkable,
but she's having
the most remarkable impact.
What's incredible about Davinia
is that she's willing to spend
time every single week
focused on people who are not her:
people not her in her neighborhood,
her state, nor even in her country --
people she'd likely never meet.
Davinia's impact started a few years ago
when she reached out
to all of her friends on Facebook,
and asked them to donate their pennies
so she could fund girls' education.
She wasn't expecting a huge response,
but 700,000 pennies later,
she's now sent over 120 girls to school.
When we spoke last week,
she told me she's become
a little infamous at the local bank
every time she rocks up
with a shopping cart full of pennies.
Now -- Davinia is not alone.
Far from it.
She's part of a growing movement.
And there's a name
for people like Davinia:
global citizens.
A global citizen is someone
who self-identifies first and foremost
not as a member of a state,
a tribe or a nation,
but as a member of the human race,
and someone who is prepared
to act on that belief,
to tackle our world's greatest challenges.
Our work is focused on finding,
supporting and activating global citizens.
They exist in every country
and among every demographic.
I want to make the case to you today
that the world's future depends
on global citizens.
I'm convinced that if we had
more global citizens active in our world,
then every single one
of the major challenges we face --
from poverty, climate change,
gender inequality --
these issues become solvable.
They are ultimately global issues,
and they can ultimately only be solved
by global citizens demanding
global solutions from their leaders.
Now, some people's immediate
reaction to this idea
is that it's either a bit utopian
or even threatening.
So I'd like to share with you
a little of my story today,
how I ended up here,
how it connects with Davinia
and, hopefully, with you.
Growing up in Melbourne, Australia,
I was one of those seriously
irritating little kids
that never, ever stopped asking, "Why?"
You might have been one yourself.
I used to ask my mum
the most annoying questions.
I'd ask her questions like,
"Mum, why I can't I dress up
and play with puppets all day?"
"Why do you want fries with that?"
"What is a shrimp,
and why do we have to keep
throwing them on the barbie?"
(Laughter)
"And mum -- this haircut.
Why?"
(Laughter)
The worst haircut, I think.
Still terrible.
As a "why" kid, I thought
I could change the world,
and it was impossible
to convince me otherwise.
And when I was 12
and in my first year of high school,
I started raising money
for communities in the developing world.
We were a really
enthusiastic group of kids,
and we raised more money
than any other school in Australia.
And so I was awarded the chance
to go to the Philippines to learn more.
It was 1998.
We were taken into a slum
in the outskirts of Manila.
It was there I became friends
with Sonny Boy,
who lived on what was literally
a pile of steaming garbage.
"Smoky Mountain" was what they called it.
But don't let the romance
of that name fool you,
because it was nothing more
than a rancid landfill
that kids like Sonny Boy spent hours
rummaging through every single day
to find something, anything of value.
That night with Sonny Boy and his family
changed my life forever,
because when it came time to go to sleep,
we simply laid down on this concrete
slab the size of half my bedroom
with myself, Sonny Boy,
and the rest of his family,
seven of us in this long line,
with the smell of rubbish all around us
and cockroaches crawling all around.
And I didn't sleep a wink,
but I lay awake thinking to myself,
"Why should anyone have to live like this
when I have so much?
Why should Sonny Boy's ability
to live out his dreams
be determined by where he's born,
or what Warren Buffett called
'the ovarian lottery?'"
I just didn't get it,
and I needed to understand why.
Now, I only later came to understand
that the poverty I'd seen
in the Philippines
was the result of decisions made
or not made, man-made,
by a succession of colonial powers
and corrupt governments
who had anything but the interests
of Sonny Boy at heart.
Sure, they didn't create Smoky Mountain,
but they may as well have.
And if we're to try to help
kids like Sonny Boy,
it wouldn't work just to try
to send him a few dollars
or to try to clean up
the garbage dump on which he lived,
because the core
of the problem lay elsewhere.
And as I worked on community
development projects over the coming years
trying to help build schools,
train teachers, and tackle HIV and AIDS,
I came to see that community development
should be driven
by communities themselves,
and that although charity is necessary,
it's not sufficient.
We need to confront these challenges
on a global scale and in a systemic way.
And the best thing I could do
is try to mobilize a large group
of citizens back home
to insist that our leaders engage
in that systemic change.
That's why, a few years later,
I joined with a group of college friends
in bringing the Make Poverty History
campaign to Australia.
We had this dream of staging
this small concert
around the time of the G20
with local Aussie artists,
and it suddenly exploded one day
when we got a phone call from Bono,
the Edge and Pearl Jam,
who all agreed to headline our concert.
I got a little bit excited
that day, as you can see.
(Laughter)
But to our amazement,
the Australian government
heard our collective voices,
and they agreed to double investment
into global health and development --
an additional 6.2 billion dollars.
It felt like --
(Applause)
It felt like this incredible validation.
By rallying citizens together,
we helped persuade our government
to do the unthinkable,
and act to fix a problem
miles outside of our borders.
But here's the thing:
it didn't last.
See, there was a change in government,
and six years later, all that new money
disappeared.
What did we learn?
We learned that one-off spikes
are not enough.
We needed a sustainable movement,
not one that is susceptible
to the fluctuating moods of a politician
or the hint of an economic downturn.
And it needed to happen everywhere;
otherwise, every individual government
would have this built-in excuse mechanism
that they couldn't possibly carry
the burden of global action alone.
And so this is what we embarked upon.
And as we embarked upon
this challenge, we asked ourselves,
how do we gain enough pressure
and build a broad enough army
to win these fights for the long term?
We could only think of one way.
We needed to somehow turn
that short-term excitement
of people involved with
the Make Poverty History campaign
into long-term passion.
It had to be part of their identity.
So in 2012, we cofounded an organization
that had exactly that as its goal.
And there was only one name for it:
Global Citizen.
But this is not about
any one organization.
This is about citizens taking action.
And research data tells us
that of the total population
who even care about global issues,
only 18 percent have done
anything about it.
It's not that people don't want to act.
It's often that they don't
know how to take action,
or that they believe that their actions
will have no effect.
So we had to somehow recruit
and activate millions of citizens
in dozens of countries
to put pressure on their leaders
to behave altruistically.
And as we did so, we discovered
something really thrilling,
that when you make
global citizenship your mission,
you suddenly find yourself
with some extraordinary allies.
See, extreme poverty isn't the only issue
that's fundamentally global.
So, too, is climate change,
human rights, gender equality,
even conflict.
We found ourselves shoulder to shoulder
with people who are passionate about
targeting all these interrelated issues.
But how did we actually
go about recruiting
and engaging those global citizens?
Well, we used the universal language:
music.
We launched the Global Citizen Festival
in the heart of New York City
in Central Park,
and we persuaded some of the world's
biggest artists to participate.
We made sure that
these festivals coincided
with the UN General Assembly meeting,
so that leaders who need
to hear our voices
couldn't possible ignore them.
But there was a twist:
you couldn't buy a ticket.
You had to earn it.
You had to take action
on behalf of a global cause,
and only once you'd done that
could you earn enough points to qualify.
Activism is the currency.
I had no interest in citizenship
purely as some sort of feel-good thing.
For me, citizenship means you have to act,
and that's what we required.
And amazingly, it worked.
Last year, more than 155,000 citizens
in the New York area alone
earned enough points to qualify.
Globally, we've now signed up citizens
in over 150 countries around the world.
And last year, we signed up
more than 100,000 new members
each and every week of the whole year.
See, we don't need to create
global citizens from nothing.
We're already everywhere.
We just need to be organized
and motivated to start acting.
And this is where I believe
we can learn a lot from Davinia,
who started taking action
as a global citizen back in 2012.
Here's what she did.
It wasn't rocket science.
She started writing letters,
emailing politicians' offices.
She volunteered her time
in her local community.
That's when she got active on social media
and started to collect pennies --
a lot of pennies.
Now, maybe that doesn't sound
like a lot to you.
How will that achieve anything?
Well, it achieved a lot
because she wasn't alone.
Her actions, alongside 142,000
other global citizens',
led the US government
to double their investment
into Global Partnership for Education.
And here's Dr. Raj Shah,
the head of USAID,
making that announcement.
See, when thousands of global citizens
find inspiration from each other,
it's amazing to see
their collective power.
Global citizens like Davinia
helped persuade the World Bank
to boost their investment
into water and sanitation.
Here's the Bank's president Jim Kim
announcing 15 billion dollars onstage
at Global Citizen,
and Prime Minister Modi of India
affirmed his commitment
to put a toilet in every household
and school across India by 2019.
Global citizens encouraged
by the late-night host Stephen Colbert
launched a Twitter invasion on Norway.
Erna Solberg, the country's
Prime Minister, got the message,
committing to double investment
into girls' education.
Global citizens together with Rotarians
called on the Canadian, UK,
and Australian governments
to boost their investment
into polio eradication.
They got together and committed
665 million dollars.
But despite all of this momentum,
we face some huge challenges.
See, you might be thinking to yourself,
how can we possibly persuade world leaders
to sustain a focus on global issues?
Indeed, the powerful American
politician Tip O'Neill once said,
"All politics is local."
That's what always
got politicians elected:
to seek, gain and hold onto power
through the pursuit of local
or at very best national interests.
I experienced this for the first time
when I was 21 years old.
I took a meeting
with a then-Australian Foreign Minister
who shall remain nameless --
[Alexander Downer]
(Laughter)
And behind closed doors,
I shared with him my passion
to end extreme poverty.
I said, "Minister -- Australia
has this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity
to help achieve the Millennium
Development Goals.
We can do this."
And he paused,
looked down on me
with cold, dismissive eyes,
and he said, "Hugh,
no one gives a funk about foreign aid."
Except he didn't use the word "funk."
He went on.
He said we need to look after
our own backyard first.
This is, I believe,
outdated, even dangerous thinking.
Or as my late grandfather would say,
complete BS.
Parochialism offers this false dichotomy
because it pits the poor in one country
against the poor in another.
It pretends we can isolate ourselves
and our nations from one another.
The whole world is our backyard,
and we ignore it at our peril.
See, look what happened
when we ignored Rwanda,
when we ignore Syria,
when we ignore climate change.
Political leaders ought to give a "funk"
because the impact of climate change
and extreme poverty
comes right to our shore.
Now, global citizens --
they understand this.
We live in a time that favors
the global citizen,
in an age where every
single voice can be heard.
See, do you remember
when the Millennium Development Goals
were signed back in the year 2000?
The most we could do in those days
was fire off a letter
and wait for the next election.
There was no social media.
Today, billions of citizens
have more tools,
more access to information,
more capacity to influence
than ever before.
Both the problems and the tools
to solve them are right before us.
The world has changed,
and those of us who look
beyond our borders
are on the right side of history.
So where are we?
So we run this amazing festival,
we've scored some big policy wins,
and citizens are signing up
all over the world.
But have we achieved our mission?
No.
We have such a long way to go.
But this is the opportunity that I see.
The concept of global citizenship,
self-evident in its logic but until now
impractical in many ways,
has coincided with this particular moment
in which we are privileged to live.
We, as global citizens,
now have a unique opportunity
to accelerate large-scale positive change
around the world.
So in the months and years ahead,
global citizens will hold
world leaders accountable
to ensure that the new Global Goals
for Sustainable Development
are tracked and implemented.
Global citizens will partner
with the world's leading NGOs
to end diseases like polio and malaria.
Global citizens will sign up
in every corner of this globe,
increasing the frequency, quality
and impact of their actions.
These dreams are within reach.
Imagine an army of millions
growing into tens of millions,
connected, informed, engaged
and unwilling to take no for an answer.
Over all these years,
I've tried to reconnect with Sonny Boy.
Sadly, I've been unable to.
We met long before social media,
and his address has now
been relocated by the authorities,
as often happens with slums.
I'd love to sit down with him,
wherever he is,
and share with him how much the time
I spent on Smoky Mountain inspired me.
Thanks to him and so many others,
I came to understand the importance
of being part of a movement of people --
the kids willing to look up
from their screens and out to the world,
the global citizens.
Global citizens who stand together,
who ask the question "Why?,"
who reject the naysayers,
and embrace the amazing possibilities
of the world we share.
I'm a global citizen.
Are you?
Thank you.
(Applause)
"What I Will"
I will not dance to your war drum.
I will not lend my soul nor my bones to your war drum.
I will not dance to that beating.
I know that beat.
It is lifeless.
I know intimately that skin you are hitting.
It was alive once,
hunted, stolen,
stretched.
I will not dance to your drummed-up war.
I will not pop, spin, break for you.
I will not hate for you
or even hate you.
I will not kill for you.
Especially I will not die for you.
I will not mourn the dead with murder nor suicide.
I will not side with you or dance to bombs
because everyone is dancing.
Everyone can be wrong.
Life is a right, not collateral or casual.
I will not forget where I come from.
I will craft my own drum.
Gather my beloved near,
and our chanting will be dancing.
Our humming will be drumming.
I will not be played.
I will not lend my name nor my rhythm to your beat.
I will dance and resist and dance and persist and dance.
This heartbeat is louder than death.
Your war drum ain't louder
than this breath. Haaa.
What's up TED people? Let me hear you make some noise.
(Applause)
A bunch of pacifists.
Confused, aspiring pacifists.
I understand.
I've been wrong a lot lately.
Like a lot.
So I couldn't figure out
what to read today.
I mean, I've been saying I've been prepping.
What that means is prepping my outfit,
(Laughter)
prepping options,
trying to figure out what I'm coming behind
and going in front of.
Poetry does that.
It preps you. It aims you.
So I am going to read a poem
that was chosen just now.
But I'm going to need you
to just sit for like 10 minutes
and hold a woman who is not here.
Hold her now
with you.
You don't need to say her name out loud, you can just hold her.
Are you holding her?
This is "Break Clustered."
All holy history banned.
Unwritten books predicted the future, projected the past.
But my head unwraps
around what appears limitless,
man's creative violence.
Whose son shall it be?
Which male child will perish a new day?
Our boys' deaths galvanize.
We cherish corpses.
We mourn women, complicated.
Bitches get beat daily.
Profits made, prophets ignored.
War and tooth, enameled salted lemon childhoods.
All colors run, none of us solid.
Don't look for shadow behind me. I carry it within.
I live cycles of light and darkness.
Rhythm is half silence.
I see now, I never was one and not the other.
Sickness, health, tender violence.
I think now I never was pure.
Before form I was storm,
blind, ign'ant -- still am.
Human contracted itself blind, malignant.
I never was pure.
Girl spoiled before ripened.
Language can't math me.
I experience exponentially.
Everything is everything.
One woman loses 15, maybe 20, members of her family.
One woman loses six.
One woman loses her head.
One woman searches rubble. One woman feeds on trash.
One woman shoots her face. One woman shoots her husband.
One woman straps herself.
One woman gives birth to a baby.
One woman gives birth to borders.
One woman no longer believes love will ever find her.
One woman never did.
Where do refugee hearts go?
Broken, dissed,
placed where they're not from, don't want to be missed.
Faced with absence.
We mourn each one
or we mean nothing at all.
My spine curves spiral.
Precipice running to and running from human beings.
Cluster bombs left behind.
De facto landmines.
A smoldering grief.
Harvest contaminated tobacco.
Harvest bombs.
Harvest baby teeth.
Harvest palms, smoke.
Harvest witness, smoke.
Resolutions, smoke.
Salvation, smoke.
Redemption, smoke.
Breathe.
Do not fear
what has blown up.
If you must,
fear the unexploded.
Thank you.
(Applause)
The first time I cried underwater
was in 2008,
the island of Curaçao,
way down in the southern Caribbean.
It's beautiful there.
I was studying these corals for my PhD,
and after days and days
of diving on the same reef,
I had gotten to know them as individuals.
I had made friends with coral colonies --
totally a normal thing to do.
Then, Hurricane Omar smashed them apart
and ripped off their skin,
leaving little bits of wounded tissue
that would have a hard time healing,
and big patches of dead skeleton
that would get overgrown by algae.
When I saw this damage for the first time,
stretching all the way down the reef,
I sunk onto the sand in my scuba gear
and I cried.
If a coral could die that fast,
how could a reef ever survive?
And why was I making it my job
to try to fight for them?
I never heard another scientist
tell that kind of story
until last year.
A scientist in Guam wrote,
"I cried right into my mask,"
seeing the damage on the reefs.
Then a scientist in Australia wrote,
"I showed my students
the results of our coral surveys,
and we wept."
Crying about corals
is having a moment, guys.
(Laughter)
And that's because reefs in the Pacific
are losing corals faster
than we've ever seen before.
Because of climate change,
the water is so hot for so long
in the summers,
that these animals
can't function normally.
They're spitting out the colored algae
that lives in their skin,
and the clear bleached tissue
that's left usually starves to death
and then rots away.
Then the skeletons are overgrown by algae.
This is happening
over an unbelievable scale.
The Northern Great Barrier Reef
lost two-thirds of its corals last year
over a distance of hundreds of miles,
then bleached again this year,
and the bleaching stretched further south.
Reefs in the Pacific
are in a nosedive right now,
and no one knows
how bad it's going to get,
except ...
over in the Caribbean where I work,
we've already been through the nosedive.
Reefs there have suffered
through centuries of intense human abuse.
We kind of already know
how the story goes.
And we might be able to help predict
what happens next.
Let's consult a graph.
Since the invention of scuba,
scientists have measured
the amount of coral on the seafloor,
and how it's changed through time.
And after centuries
of ratcheting human pressure,
Caribbean reefs met one of three fates.
Some reefs lost their corals very quickly.
Some reefs lost their corals more slowly,
but kind of ended up in the same place.
OK, so far this is not going very well.
But some reefs in the Caribbean --
the ones best protected
and the ones a little
further from humans --
they managed to hold onto their corals.
Give us a challenge.
And, we almost never saw a reef hit zero.
The second time I cried underwater
was on the north shore of Curaçao, 2011.
It was the calmest day of the year,
but it's always pretty
sketchy diving there.
My boyfriend and I swam against the waves.
I watched my compass
so we could find our way back out,
and he watched for sharks,
and after 20 minutes of swimming
that felt like an hour,
we finally dropped down to the reef,
and I was so shocked,
and I was so happy
that my eyes filled with tears.
There were corals 1,000 years old
lined up one after another.
They had survived the entire history
of European colonialism in the Caribbean,
and for centuries before that.
I never knew what a coral could do
when it was given a chance to thrive.
The truth is that even
as we lose so many corals,
even as we go through
this massive coral die-off,
some reefs will survive.
Some will be ragged on the edge,
some will be beautiful.
And by protecting shorelines
and giving us food to eat
and supporting tourism,
they will still be worth
billions and billions of dollars a year.
The best time to protect a reef
was 50 years ago,
but the second-best time is right now.
Even as we go through bleaching events,
more frequent and in more places,
some corals will be able to recover.
We had a bleaching event
in 2010 in the Caribbean
that took off big patches of skin
on boulder corals like these.
This coral lost half of its skin.
But if you look at the side
of this coral a few years later,
this coral is actually healthy again.
It's doing what a healthy coral does.
It's making copies of its polyps,
it's fighting back the algae
and it's reclaiming its territory.
If a few polyps survive,
a coral can regrow;
it just needs time and protection
and a reasonable temperature.
Some corals can regrow in 10 years --
others take a lot longer.
But the more stresses
we take off them locally --
things like overfishing,
sewage pollution, fertilizer pollution,
dredging, coastal construction --
the better they can hang on
as we stabilize the climate,
and the faster they can regrow.
And as we go through the long,
tough and necessary process
of stabilizing the climate
of planet Earth,
some new corals will still be born.
This is what I study in my research.
We try to understand
how corals make babies,
and how those babies
find their way to the reef,
and we invent new methods
to help them survive
those early, fragile life stages.
One of my favorite
coral babies of all time
showed up right after Hurricane Omar.
It's the same species
I was studying before the storm,
but you almost never see
babies of this species --
it's really rare.
This is actually an endangered species.
In this photo, this little baby coral,
this little circle of polyps,
is a few years old.
Like its cousins that bleach,
it's fighting back the algae.
And like its cousins on the north shore,
it's aiming to live for 1,000 years.
What's happening in the world
and in the ocean
has changed our time horizon.
We can be incredibly pessimistic
on the short term,
and mourn what we lost
and what we really took for granted.
But we can still be optimistic
on the long term,
and we can still be ambitious
about what we fight for
and what we expect from our governments,
from our planet.
Corals have been living on planet Earth
for hundreds of millions of years.
They survived the extinction
of the dinosaurs.
They're badasses.
(Laughter)
An individual coral can go through
tremendous trauma and fully recover
if it's given a chance
and it's given protection.
Corals have always
been playing the long game,
and now so are we.
Thanks very much.

Gardening is the most therapeutic

RF: Gardening is the most therapeutic

People in these areas --
they're exposed to crappy food.
I want people to know

Erin McKean: I'm a lexicographer.
My job is to put every word

RW: I love words, too --
just as much as any lexi-ta-tographer.
What if you love a word

like -- I don't know -- "scuberfinkles"?
Beau Lotto: Do you think you see reality?
RW: Well, I'm a little
nearsighted, but yeah.
BL: Well, you can't -- I mean,
your brain has no access to this world.
In fact, even the sensory information
that your eyes are receiving,
your ears are receiving,
is completely meaningless
because it could mean anything.
That tree could be a large object far away
or a small object up close,
and your brain has no way of knowing.
RW: Once I thought I saw Bigfoot
but it was just a German shepherd.
Isabel Behncke Izquierdo: Bonobos
are, together with chimpanzees,

RW: I'm just curious:
Do we have any conflict
that needs managing
or social issues to resolve?
IBI: Remember --
you're on a date with my idea,
not me.
Jane McGonigal: This is the face

RW: An epic win?
JM: An epic win is an outcome
so extraordinarily positive,
you didn't even know it was possible
until you achieved it.
You're not making the face.
You're making the "I'm not
good at life" face.
RW: Arthur, I want to be
really honest with you.
I am seeing other ideas. OK?
I'm dating around.
That's the situation.
Arthur Benjamin: I'd say this:
Mathematics is not just solving for x,
it's also figuring out why.
RW: Do you want to get some pie?

Without power,

to solve all of our current conditions.
RW: And, "If you choose not to decide,
you still have made a choice" -- Rush.
JM: Yes!
This is the face we need to see

RW: I want to have your idea baby.
RWatts: Well, you know
what they say in Russia.
RW: Hm?
RWatts: "scuberfinckle."
(Bottles clink)
I believe that the secret to producing
extremely drought-tolerant crops,
which should go some way
to providing food security in the world,
lies in resurrection plants,
pictured here, in an extremely
droughted state.
You might think
that these plants look dead,
but they're not.
Give them water,
and they will resurrect, green up,
start growing, in 12 to 48 hours.
Now, why would I suggest
that producing drought-tolerant crops
will go towards providing food security?
Well, the current world population
is around 7 billion.
And it's estimated that by 2050,
we'll be between 9 and 10 billion people,
with the bulk of this growth
happening in Africa.
The food and agricultural
organizations of the world
have suggested that we need
a 70 percent increase
in current agricultural practice
to meet that demand.
Given that plants
are at the base of the food chain,
most of that's going
to have to come from plants.
That percentage of 70 percent
does not take into consideration
the potential effects of climate change.
This is taken from a study by Dai
published in 2011,
where he took into consideration
all the potential effects
of climate change
and expressed them --
amongst other things --
increased aridity due to lack of rain
or infrequent rain.
The areas in red shown here,
are areas that until recently
have been very successfully
used for agriculture,
but cannot anymore
because of lack of rainfall.
This is the situation
that's predicted to happen in 2050.
Much of Africa,
in fact, much of the world,
is going to be in trouble.
We're going to have to think of some
very smart ways of producing food.
And preferably among them,
some drought-tolerant crops.
The other thing
to remember about Africa is
that most of their agriculture is rainfed.
Now, making drought-tolerant crops
is not the easiest thing in the world.
And the reason for this is water.
Water is essential to life on this planet.
All living, actively
metabolizing organisms,
from microbes to you and I,
are comprised predominately of water.
All life reactions happen in water.
And loss of a small amount
of water results in death.
You and I are 65 percent water --
we lose one percent of that, we die.
But we can make behavioral
changes to avoid that.
Plants can't.
They're stuck in the ground.
And so in the first instance they have
a little bit more water than us,
about 95 percent water,
and they can lose
a little bit more than us,
like 10 to about 70 percent,
depending on the species,
but for short periods only.
Most of them will either try
to resist or avoid water loss.
So extreme examples of resistors
can be found in succulents.
They tend to be small, very attractive,
but they hold onto their water
at such great cost
that they grow extremely slowly.
Examples of avoidance of water loss
are found in trees and shrubs.
They send down very deep roots,
mine subterranean water supplies
and just keep flushing
it through them at all times,
keeping themselves hydrated.
The one on the right is called a baobab.
It's also called the upside-down tree,
simply because the proportion
of roots to shoots is so great
that it looks like the tree
has been planted upside down.
And of course the roots are required
for hydration of that plant.
And probably the most common strategy
of avoidance is found in annuals.
Annuals make up the bulk
of our plant food supplies.
Up the west coast of my country,
for much of the year
you don't see much vegetation growth.
But come the spring rains, you get this:
flowering of the desert.
The strategy in annuals,
is to grow only in the rainy season.
At the end of that season
they produce a seed,
which is dry, eight to 10 percent water,
but very much alive.
And anything that is
that dry and still alive,
we call desiccation-tolerant.
In the desiccated state,
what seeds can do
is lie in extremes of environment
for prolonged periods of time.
The next time the rainy season comes,
they germinate and grow,
and the whole cycle just starts again.
It's widely believed that the evolution
of desiccation-tolerant seeds
allowed the colonization and the radiation
of flowering plants,
or angiosperms, onto land.
But back to annuals
as our major form of food supplies.
Wheat, rice and maize form 95 percent
of our plant food supplies.
And it's been a great strategy
because in a short space of time
you can produce a lot of seed.
Seeds are energy-rich
so there's a lot of food calories,
you can store it in times of plenty
for times of famine,
but there's a downside.
The vegetative tissues,
the roots and leaves of annuals,
do not have much
by way of inherent resistance,
avoidance or tolerance characteristics.
They just don't need them.
They grow in the rainy season
and they've got a seed
to help them survive the rest of the year.
And so despite concerted
efforts in agriculture
to make crops with improved properties
of resistance, avoidance and tolerance --
particularly resistance and avoidance
because we've had good models
to understand how those work --
we still get images like this.
Maize crop in Africa,
two weeks without rain
and it's dead.
There is a solution:
resurrection plants.
These plants can lose 95 percent
of their cellular water,
remain in a dry, dead-like state
for months to years,
and give them water,
they green up and start growing again.
Like seeds, these are
desiccation-tolerant.
Like seeds, these can withstand extremes
of environmental conditions.
And this is a really rare phenomenon.
There are only 135 flowering
plant species that can do this.
I'm going to show you a video
of the resurrection process
of these three species
in that order.
And at the bottom,
there's a time axis
so you can see how quickly it happens.
(Applause)
Pretty amazing, huh?
So I've spent the last 21 years
trying to understand how they do this.
How do these plants dry without dying?
And I work on a variety
of different resurrection plants,
shown here in the hydrated and dry states,
for a number of reasons.
One of them is that each
of these plants serves as a model
for a crop that I'd like
to make drought-tolerant.
So on the extreme top left,
for example, is a grass,
it's called Eragrostis nindensis,
it's got a close relative
called Eragrostis tef --
a lot of you might know it as "teff" --
it's a staple food in Ethiopia,
it's gluten-free,
and it's something we would like
to make drought-tolerant.
The other reason for looking
at a number of plants,
is that, at least initially,
I wanted to find out:
do they do the same thing?
Do they all use the same mechanisms
to be able to lose
all that water and not die?
So I undertook what we call
a systems biology approach
in order to get
a comprehensive understanding
of desiccation tolerance,
in which we look at everything
from the molecular to the whole plant,
ecophysiological level.
For example we look at things like
changes in the plant anatomy
as they dried out
and their ultrastructure.
We look at the transcriptome,
which is just a term for a technology
in which we look at the genes
that are switched on or off,
in response to drying.
Most genes will code for proteins,
so we look at the proteome.
What are the proteins made
in response to drying?
Some proteins would code for enzymes
which make metabolites,
so we look at the metabolome.
Now, this is important
because plants are stuck in the ground.
They use what I call
a highly tuned chemical arsenal
to protect themselves from all
the stresses of their environment.
So it's important that we look
at the chemical changes
involved in drying.
And at the last study
that we do at the molecular level,
we look at the lipidome --
the lipid changes in response to drying.
And that's also important
because all biological membranes
are made of lipids.
They're held as membranes
because they're in water.
Take away the water,
those membranes fall apart.
Lipids also act as signals
to turn on genes.
Then we use physiological
and biochemical studies
to try and understand
the function of the putative protectants
that we've actually discovered
in our other studies.
And then use all of that
to try and understand
how the plant copes
with its natural environment.
I've always had the philosophy that
I needed a comprehensive understanding
of the mechanisms of desiccation tolerance
in order to make a meaningful suggestion
for a biotic application.
I'm sure some of you are thinking,
"By biotic application,
does she mean she's going to make
genetically modified crops?"
And the answer to that question is:
depends on your definition
of genetic modification.
All of the crops that we eat today,
wheat, rice and maize,
are highly genetically modified
from their ancestors,
but we don't consider them GM
because they're being produced
by conventional breeding.
If you mean, am I going to put
resurrection plant genes into crops,
your answer is yes.
In the essence of time,
we have tried that approach.
More appropriately,
some of my collaborators at UCT,
Jennifer Thomson, Suhail Rafudeen,
have spearheaded that approach
and I'm going to show you some data soon.
But we're about to embark
upon an extremely ambitious approach,
in which we aim to turn on
whole suites of genes
that are already present in every crop.
They're just never turned on
under extreme drought conditions.
I leave it up to you to decide
whether those should be called GM or not.
I'm going to now just give you
some of the data from that first approach.
And in order to do that
I have to explain a little bit
about how genes work.
So you probably all know
that genes are made
of double-stranded DNA.
It's wound very tightly into chromosomes
that are present in every cell
of your body or in a plant's body.
If you unwind that DNA, you get genes.
And each gene has a promoter,
which is just an on-off switch,
the gene coding region,
and then a terminator,
which indicates that this is the end
of this gene, the next gene will start.
Now, promoters are not
simple on-off switches.
They normally require
a lot of fine-tuning,
lots of things to be present and correct
before that gene is switched on.
So what's typically done
in biotech studies
is that we use an inducible promoter,
we know how to switch it on.
We couple that to genes of interest
and put that into a plant
and see how the plant responds.
In the study that I'm going
to talk to you about,
my collaborators used
a drought-induced promoter,
which we discovered
in a resurrection plant.
The nice thing about this promoter
is that we do nothing.
The plant itself senses drought.
And we've used it to drive antioxidant
genes from resurrection plants.
Why antioxidant genes?
Well, all stresses,
particularly drought stress,
results in the formation of free radicals,
or reactive oxygen species,
which are highly damaging
and can cause crop death.
What antioxidants do is stop that damage.
So here's some data from a maize strain
that's very popularly used in Africa.
To the left of the arrow
are plants without the genes,
to the right --
plants with the antioxidant genes.
After three weeks without watering,
the ones with the genes
do a hell of a lot better.
Now to the final approach.
My research has shown
that there's considerable similarity
in the mechanisms of desiccation tolerance
in seeds and resurrection plants.
So I ask the question,
are they using the same genes?
Or slightly differently phrased,
are resurrection plants using genes
evolved in seed desiccation tolerance
in their roots and leaves?
Have they retasked these seed genes
in roots and leaves
of resurrection plants?
And I answer that question,
as a consequence of a lot
of research from my group
and recent collaborations from a group
of Henk Hilhorst in the Netherlands,
Mel Oliver in the United States
and Julia Buitink in France.
The answer is yes,
that there is a core set of genes
that are involved in both.
And I'm going to illustrate this
very crudely for maize,
where the chromosomes below the off switch
represent all the genes that are required
for desiccation tolerance.
So as maize seeds dried out
at the end of their period of development,
they switch these genes on.
Resurrection plants
switch on the same genes
when they dry out.
All modern crops, therefore,
have these genes
in their roots and leaves,
they just never switch them on.
They only switch them on in seed tissues.
So what we're trying to do right now
is to understand the environmental
and cellular signals
that switch on these genes
in resurrection plants,
to mimic the process in crops.
And just a final thought.
What we're trying to do very rapidly
is to repeat what nature did
in the evolution of resurrection plants
some 10 to 40 million years ago.
My plants and I thank you
for your attention.
(Applause)
There are a lot of web 2.0 consultants
who make a lot of money.
In fact, they make
their living on this stuff.
I'm going to try to save you
all the time and money
and go through it in the next
three minutes, so bear with me.
Started a website in 2005
with a few friends, called Reddit.com.
It's what you'd call
a social news website;
basically, the democratic front page
of the best stuff on the web.
You find some interesting content --
say, a TED Talk -- submit it to Reddit,
and a community of your peers votes up
if they like it, down if they don't.
That creates the front page.
It's always rising, falling;
a half million people visit every day.
But this isn't about Reddit.
It's about discovering new things
that pop up on the web.
In the last four years,
we've seen all kinds of memes,
all kinds of trends get born
right on our front page.
This isn't about Reddit itself,
it's actually about humpback whales.
Well, technically, it's about Greenpeace,
an environmental organization
that wanted to stop the Japanese
government's whaling campaign.
The whales were getting killed;
they wanted to put an end to it.
One of the ways they wanted to do it
was to put a tracking chip
inside one of the whales.
But to personify the movement,
they wanted to name it.
So in true web fashion,
they put together a poll,
where they had a bunch of very erudite,
very thoughtful, cultured names.
I believe this is the Farsi word
for "immortal."
I think this means "divine power
of the ocean" in a Polynesian language.
And then there was this:
"Mister Splashy Pants."
(Laughter)
And this was a special name.
Mister Pants, or "Splashy" to his friends,
was very popular on the Internet.
In fact, someone on Reddit thought,
"What a great thing,
we should all vote this up."
And Redditors responded and all agreed.
So the voting started.
We got behind it ourselves;
we changed our logo for the day,
from the alien to Splashy,
to help the cause.
And it wasn't long before other sites
like Fark and Boing Boing
and the rest of the Internet started
saying, "We love Splashy Pants!"
So it went from about five percent,
which was when this meme started,
to 70 percent at the end of voting.
Pretty impressive, right?
We won! Mister Splashy Pants was chosen.
Just kidding -- Greenpeace
actually wasn't that crazy about it,
because they wanted one
of the more thoughtful names to win.
They said, "No, just kidding.
We'll give it another week of voting."
Well, that got us a little angry,
so we changed it to Fightin' Splashy.
(Laughter)
And the Reddit community --
really, the rest of the Internet,
really got behind this.
Facebook groups were created.
Facebook applications were created.
The idea was, "Vote your conscience,
vote for Mister Splashy Pants."
People were putting up signs
in the real world about this whale.
(Laughter)
This was the final vote:
78 percent of the votes.
To give you an idea of the landslide,
the next highest name pulled in three.
There was a clear lesson:
the Internet loves Mister Splashy Pants.
Which is obvious. It's a great name.
Everyone wants to hear their news
anchor say, "Mister Splashy Pants."
(Laughter)
I think that's what helped drive this.
What was cool were the repercussions.
Greenpeace created an entire
marketing campaign around it --
Mister Splashy Pants shirts and pins,
an e-card so you could send
your friend a dancing Splashy.
But even more important
was that they accomplished their mission.
The Japanese government
called off their whaling expedition.
Mission accomplished:
Greenpeace was thrilled,
the whales were happy -- that's a quote.
(Laughter)
And actually, Redditors
in the Internet community
were happy to participate,
but they weren't whale lovers.
A few, certainly, but we're talking
about a lot of people,
really interested
and caught up in this meme.
Greenpeace came back to the site
and thanked Reddit for its participation.
But this wasn't really altruism;
just interest in doing something cool.
This is how the Internet works.
This is that great big secret.
The Internet provides
a level playing field.
Your link is as good as your link,
which is as good as my link.
With a browser, anyone can get
to any website no matter your budget.
That is, as long as you can
keep net neutrality in place.
Another important thing is it costs
nothing to get content online.
There are so many
publishing tools available,
it only takes a few minutes
to produce something.
and the cost of iteration
is so cheap, you might as well.
If you do, be genuine.
Be honest, up-front.
One of the great lessons
Greenpeace learned
is that it's OK to lose control,
OK to take yourself
a little less seriously,
given that, even though
it's a very serious cause,
you could ultimately achieve your goal.
That's the final message I want to share:
you can do well online.
But no longer is the message
coming from just the top down.
If you want to succeed you've got
to be OK to lose control.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Most people think
that new technology or advanced technology
can never start in Africa.
Instead, they think that the best way
to help the continent advance
is by providing aid or services
that the continent
can't provide for itself.
So while we see advanced
technology like robotics
and artificial intelligence
growing exponentially
in the developed world,
those same people are worried
that a technologically backward
Africa is falling behind.
That attitude couldn't be more wrong.
I'm a robotics entrepreneur
who's spent a lot of time here in Africa.
And in 2014 we created Zipline,
which is a company that uses
electric autonomous aircraft
to deliver medicine to hospitals
and health centers on demand.
Last year, we launched the world's first
automated delivery system
operating at national scale.
And guess what?
We did not do that in the US,
we didn't do it in Japan,
and we didn't do it in Europe.
It was actually President Paul Kagame
and the Rwandan Ministry of Health
that made a big bet
on the potential of this technology
and signed a commercial contract
to deliver a majority
of the country's blood on demand.
(Applause)
Yeah, they deserve the applause.
So why is blood important?
Rwanda collects between 60- and 80,000
units of blood a year.
So this is a product
that when you need it,
you really, really need it.
But blood is also challenging,
because it has a very short shelf life,
there are lots of different
storage requirements,
and it's really hard to predict the demand
for all of these different blood groups
before a patient actually needs something.
But the cool thing is
that using this technology,
Rwanda has been able to keep
more blood centralized
and then provide it
when a patient needs something
to any hospital or health center
in an average of just 20 or 30 minutes.
Do you guys want to see how it works?
(Audience) Yes.
All right. Nobody believes me,
so ... better to show.
This is our distribution center,
which is about 20 kilometers
outside of Kigali.
This actually used to be a cornfield
nine months ago,
and with the Rwandan government,
we leveled it and built this center
in a couple weeks.
So when a patient is having an emergency,
a doctor or a nurse at that hospital
can send us a WhatsApp,
telling us what they need.
And then our team will immediately
spring into action.
We pull the blood from our stock,
which is delivered from the National
Center for Blood Transfusion;
we scan the blood into our system
so the Ministry of Health
knows where the blood is going;
and then we'll basically
pack it into a Zip,
which is what we call
these little autonomous airplanes
that run on batteries.
And then once that Zip is ready to go,
we accelerate it from zero
to 100 kilometers an hour
in about half of a second.
(Audience) Whoa!
And from the moment it leaves
the end of the launcher,
it's completely autonomous.
(Video: Air traffic controller

This is our air traffic
controller calling it in
to Kigali International Airport.
And when the Zip arrives at the hospital,
it descends to about 30 feet
and drops the package.
We use a really simple paper parachute --
simple things are best --
that allows the package to come
to the ground gently and reliably
in the same place every time.
So it's just like ride sharing;
the doctors get a text message
one minute before we arrive, saying,
"Walk outside and receive your delivery."
(Laughter)
And then --
(Applause)
and then the doctors have what they need
to save a patient's life.
This is actually watching a delivery
happen from our distribution center;
this vehicle is about 50 kilometers away.
We're able to watch the vehicle
as it makes a delivery at a hospital
in real time.
You may have noticed there are pings
that are coming off
of that vehicle on the screen.
Those pings are actually data packets
that we're getting
over the cell phone networks.
So these planes have SIM cards
just like your cell phone does,
and they're communicating
over the cell network
to tell us where they are
and how they're doing at all times.
Believe it or not,
we actually buy family plans --
(Laughter)
for this fleet of vehicles,
because that's how we get the best rates.
(Laughter)
It's actually not a joke.
(Laughter)
So today, we're delivering
about 20 percent
of the national blood supply of Rwanda
outside of Kigali.
We serve about 12 hospitals,
and we're adding hospitals to that network
at an accelerating rate.
All of those hospitals only receive
blood in this way,
and most of those hospitals
actually place multiple orders every day.
So the reason --
in all of health care logistics,
you're always trading off
waste against access.
So if you want to solve waste,
you keep everything centralized.
As a result, when patients
are having emergencies,
sometimes they don't have
the medical product they need.
If you want to solve access, you stock
a lot of medicine at the last mile,
at hospitals or health centers,
and then patients have
the medicine they need.
But you end up throwing
a lot of medicine out,
which is very expensive.
What's so amazing is that the Rwandan
government has been able
to break this cycle permanently.
Because doctors can get
what they need instantly,
they actually stock
less blood at the hospitals.
So although use of blood products
has increased substantially
at all the hospitals we serve,
in the last nine months,
zero units of blood have expired
at any of these hospitals.
(Applause)
That's an amazing result.
That's actually not been achieved
by any other health care system
on the planet,
and it happened here.
But obviously, when we're talking about
delivering medical products instantly,
the most important thing is patients.
Let me give you an example.
A couple months ago, a 24-year-old mother
came into one of the hospitals
that we serve,
and she gave birth via C-section.
But that led to complications,
and she started to bleed.
Luckily, the doctors had some blood
of her blood type on hand
that had been delivered
via Zipline's routine service,
and so they transfused her
with a couple units of blood.
But she bled out of those units
in about 10 minutes.
In this case, that mother's life
is in grave danger --
in any hospital in the world.
But luckily, the doctors
who were taking care of her
immediately called
our distribution center,
they placed an emergency order,
and our team actually did emergency
delivery after emergency delivery
after emergency delivery.
They ended up sending
seven units of red blood cells,
four units of plasma
and two units of platelets.
That's more blood than you have
in your entire body.
All of it was transfused into her,
the doctors were able to stabilize her,
and she is healthy today.
(Applause)
Since we launched, we've done about 400
emergency deliveries like that,
and there's a story like that one
behind most of those emergencies.
Here are just a couple of the moms
who have received transfusions in this way
in the last couple months.
We're always reminded: when we can help
a doctor save a mom's life,
it's not just her life that you're saving.
That's also a baby boy or a baby girl
who has a mother while they're growing up.
(Applause)
But I want to be clear:
postpartum hemorrhaging --
it's not a Rwanda problem,
it's not a developing-world problem --
this is a global problem.
Maternal health is a challenge everywhere.
The main difference is that
Rwanda was the first country
to use radical technology
to do something about it.
And that's the reason this attitude
of Africa being disrupted
or advanced technology not working here
or needing aid
is so totally wrong.
Africa can be the disrupter.
These small, agile, developing economies
can out-innovate large, rich ones.
And they can totally leapfrog over
the absence of legacy infrastructure
to go straight to newer
and better systems.
In 2000,
if you had said that high-quality
cellular networks were about to roll out
across all of Africa,
people would have told you
that you were crazy.
And yet, no one anticipated
how fast those networks were going
to connect and empower people.
Today, 44 percent of the GDP of Kenya
flows through M-Pesa,
their mobile payment platform.
And not only that,
but our autonomous fleet of vehicles
relies on that cellular network.
Over the next few years as we start
serving private health care facilities,
we'll also use that mobile
payment platform
to collect fees for deliveries.
So innovation leads to more innovation
leads to more innovation.
And meanwhile,
most people who live
in developed economies
think that drone delivery
is technologically impossible,
let alone happening
at national scale in East Africa.
And I do mean East Africa,
not just Rwanda.
On Thursday, just a couple days ago,
the Tanzanian Ministry of Health announced
that they are going to use
this same technology
to provide instant delivery
of a wide range of medical products
to 10 million of the hardest to reach
people in the country.
(Applause)
It's actually going to be the largest
autonomous system anywhere in the world.
To give you a sense
of what this looks like,
this is one of the first
distribution centers.
You can see a 75-kilometer service radius
around the distribution center,
and that allows us to serve hundreds
of health facilities and hospitals,
all of which are rural,
from that single distribution center.
But to serve over 20 percent
of the population of Tanzania,
we're going to need
multiple distribution centers.
We'll actually need four.
And from these distribution centers,
we expect to be doing several hundred
lifesaving deliveries every day,
and this system will ultimately serve
over 1,000 health facilities
and hospitals in the country.
So yeah, East Africa
is moving really fast.
One thing that people, I think, often miss
is that these kinds of leaps
generate compounding gains.
For example, Rwanda, by investing
in this infrastructure for health care,
now has an aerial logistics network
that they can use
to catalyze other parts of their economy,
like agriculture or e-commerce.
Even more importantly,
100 percent of the teams we hire
at these distribution centers are local.
So here's our Rwandan team,
which is a group of extraordinary
engineers and operators.
They run the world's only
automated delivery system
operating at national scale.
They have been able to master something
that the largest technology
companies in the world
have not yet been able to figure out.
So they are total heroes.
(Applause)
They're total heroes.
Our team's mission is to deliver
basic access to medicine
to all seven billion people on the planet,
no matter how hard it is to reach them.
We often tell people about that mission,
and they say, "That's so generous
of you, it's so philanthropic."
No!
Philanthropy has nothing to do with it.
Because of the commercial contracts
that we sign with ministries of health,
these networks are 100 percent
sustainable and scalable.
And the reason we feel so strongly
about correcting that misperception
is that entrepreneurship
is the only force in human history
that has lifted millions
of people out of poverty.
(Applause)
No amount of foreign aid
is going to sustainably employ
250 million African youth.
And the jobs that these kids
may have gotten 10 years ago
are largely being automated
or are being changed
dramatically by technology.
So they are looking for new skill sets,
new competitive advantages.
They're looking for start-ups.
So why aren't there more start-ups
that are tackling these global problems
that are faced by billions of people
in developing economies?
The reason is that investors
and entrepreneurs are totally blind
to the opportunity.
We think these problems are the domain
of NGOs or governments,
not private companies.
That's what we have to change.
You may have noticed
I left something out of the video
that I showed you.
I didn't show you how the planes land
when they get back
to the distribution center.
So, it might be obvious to you:
none of our planes have landing gear.
We also don't have runways
where we operate.
So we have to be able
to decelerate the plane
from about 100 kilometers an hour
to zero in half of a second.
And the way we do that
is we actually use a wire that tracks
that plane as it comes in,
with centimeter-level accuracy.
We snag the plane out of the sky,
and then we gently plop it
onto an actively inflated cushion.
This is basically a combination
of an aircraft carrier
and a bouncy castle.
(Laughter)
So let me show you.
(Laughter)
(Applause)
And it might be obvious to you
why I wanted to end with this video.
I wanted to show you the kids
and the teenagers
who line up on the fence every day.
They cheer every launch and every landing.
(Laughter)
(Applause)
Sometimes I actually show up
at the distribution center early
because I'm jet-lagged.
I'll show up an hour before
we begin operation.
And there will be kids on the fence
getting good seats.
(Laughter)
And you go up and you ask them,
"What do you think about the planes?"
And they'll say, "Oh,
it's a sky ambulance."
So they get it.
I mean, they get it more than most adults.
So I was asking earlier:
Who is going to be creating the disruptive
technology companies of Africa
over the next decade?
Ultimately, it's going
to be up to these kids.
They are the engineers
of Rwanda and Africa.
They are the engineers
of our shared future.
But the only way they can build
that future is if we realize
that world-changing companies
can scale in Africa,
and that disruptive technology
can start here first.
Thanks.
(Applause)
We are losing our listening.
We spend roughly 60 percent
of our communication time listening,
but we're not very good at it.
We retain just 25 percent of what we hear.
Now -- not you, not this talk,
but that is generally true.
(Laughter)
Let's define listening
as making meaning from sound.
It's a mental process,
and it's a process of extraction.
We use some pretty cool
techniques to do this.
One of them is pattern recognition.
(Crowd noises) So in a cocktail
party like this,
if I say, "David, Sara, pay attention" --
some of you just sat up.
We recognize patterns
to distinguish noise from signal,
and especially our name.
Differencing is another technique we use.
If I left this pink noise on
for more than a couple of minutes,
(Pink noise) you would literally
cease to hear it.
We listen to differences;
we discount sounds that remain the same.
And then there is a whole
range of filters.
These filters take us from all sound
down to what we pay attention to.
Most people are entirely
unconscious of these filters.
But they actually create
our reality in a way,
because they tell us what
we're paying attention to right now.
I'll give you one example of that.
Intention is very important
in sound, in listening.
When I married my wife,
I promised her I would listen
to her every day
as if for the first time.
Now that's something
I fall short of on a daily basis.
(Laughter)
But it's a great intention
to have in a relationship.
(Laughter)
But that's not all.
Sound places us in space and in time.
If you close your eyes
right now in this room,
you're aware of the size of the room
from the reverberation and the bouncing
of the sound off the surfaces;
you're aware of how many
people are around you,
because of the micro-noises
you're receiving.
And sound places us in time as well,
because sound always has
time embedded in it.
In fact, I would suggest
that our listening is the main way
that we experience the flow of time
from past to future.
So, "Sonority is time
and meaning" -- a great quote.
I said at the beginning,
we're losing our listening.
Why did I say that?
Well, there are a lot of reasons for this.
First of all, we invented
ways of recording --
first writing, then audio recording
and now video recording as well.
The premium on accurate and careful
listening has simply disappeared.
Secondly, the world is now so noisy,
(Noise) with this cacophony
going on visually and auditorily,
it's just hard to listen;
it's tiring to listen.
Many people take refuge in headphones,
but they turn big,
public spaces like this,
shared soundscapes,
into millions of tiny,
little personal sound bubbles.
In this scenario,
nobody's listening to anybody.
We're becoming impatient.
We don't want oratory anymore;
we want sound bites.
And the art of conversation is being
replaced -- dangerously, I think --
by personal broadcasting.
I don't know how much listening
there is in this conversation,
which is sadly very common,
especially in the UK.
We're becoming desensitized.
Our media have to scream at us
with these kinds of headlines
in order to get our attention.
And that means it's harder
for us to pay attention
to the quiet, the subtle, the understated.
This is a serious problem
that we're losing our listening.
This is not trivial,
because listening is our access
to understanding.
Conscious listening
always creates understanding,
and only without conscious listening
can these things happen.
A world where we don't listen
to each other at all
is a very scary place indeed.
So I'd like to share with you
five simple exercises,
tools you can take away with you,
to improve your own conscious listening.
Would you like that?
Audience: Yes!
Good. The first one is silence.
Just three minutes a day of silence
is a wonderful exercise
to reset your ears and to recalibrate,
so that you can hear the quiet again.
If you can't get absolute silence,
go for quiet, that's absolutely fine.
Second, I call this "the mixer."
(Noise) So even if you're
in a noisy environment like this --
and we all spend a lot of time
in places like this --
listen in the coffee bar
to how many channels of sound can I hear?
How many individual channels
in that mix am I listening to?
You can do it in a beautiful place
as well, like in a lake.
How many birds am I hearing?
Where are they? Where are those ripples?
It's a great exercise for improving
the quality of your listening.
Third, this exercise I call "savoring,"
and this is a beautiful exercise.
It's about enjoying mundane sounds.
This, for example, is my tumble dryer.
(Dryer)
It's a waltz -- one, two, three;
one, two, three; one, two, three.
I love it!
Or just try this one on for size.
(Coffee grinder)
Wow!
So, mundane sounds
can be really interesting --
if you pay attention.
I call that the "hidden choir" --
it's around us all the time.
The next exercise is probably
the most important of all of these,
if you just take one thing away.
This is listening positions --
the idea that you can move
your listening position
to what's appropriate
to what you're listening to.
This is playing with those filters.
Remember I gave you those filters?
It's starting to play with them as levers,
to get conscious about them
and to move to different places.
These are just some
of the listening positions,
or scales of listening
positions, that you can use.
There are many.
Have fun with that. It's very exciting.
And finally, an acronym.
You can use this in listening,
in communication.
If you're in any one of those roles --
and I think that probably is everybody
who's listening to this talk --
the acronym is RASA,
which is the Sanskrit word
for "juice" or "essence."
And RASA stands for "Receive,"
which means pay attention to the person;
"Appreciate," making little noises
like "hmm," "oh," "OK";
"Summarize" -- the word "so"
is very important in communication;
and "Ask," ask questions afterwards.
Now sound is my passion, it's my life.
I wrote a whole book about it.
So I live to listen.
That's too much to ask for most people.
But I believe that every human being
needs to listen consciously
in order to live fully --
connected in space and in time
to the physical world around us,
connected in understanding to each other,
not to mention spiritually connected,
because every spiritual path
I know of has listening and contemplation
at its heart.
That's why we need to teach listening
in our schools as a skill.
Why is it not taught? It's crazy.
And if we can teach listening
in our schools,
we can take our listening
off that slippery slope
to that dangerous, scary world
that I talked about,
and move it to a place where everybody
is consciously listening all the time,
or at least capable of doing it.
Now, I don't know how to do that,
but this is TED,
and I think the TED community
is capable of anything.
So I invite you to connect with me,
connect with each other,
take this mission out.
And let's get listening taught in schools,
and transform the world in one generation
to a conscious, listening world --
a world of connection,
a world of understanding
and a world of peace.
Thank you for listening to me today.
(Applause)
Namaskar.
I'm a movie star, I'm 51 years of age,
and I don't use Botox as yet.
(Laughter)
So I'm clean, but I do behave like you saw
like a 21-year-old in my movies.
Yeah, I do that.
I sell dreams, and I peddle love
to millions of people back home in India
who assume that I'm
the best lover in the world.
(Laughter)
If you don't tell anyone,
I'm going to tell you I'm not,
but I never let that assumption go away.
(Laughter)
I've also been made to understand
there are lots of you here
who haven't seen my work,
and I feel really sad for you.
(Laughter)
(Applause)
That doesn't take away from the fact
that I'm completely self-obsessed,
as a movie star should be.
(Laughter)
That's when my friends,
Chris and Juliet called me here
to speak about the future "you."
Naturally, it follows I'm going
to speak about the present me.
(Laughter)
Because I truly believe
that humanity is a lot like me.
(Laughter)
It is. It is.
It's an aging movie star,
grappling with all
the newness around itself,
wondering whether
it got it right in the first place,
and still trying to find a way
to keep on shining regardless.
I was born in a refugee colony
in the capital city of India, New Delhi.
And my father was a freedom fighter.
My mother was, well,
just a fighter like mothers are.
And much like the original homo sapiens,
we struggled to survive.
When I was in my early 20s,
I lost both my parents,
which I must admit
seems a bit careless of me now,
but --
(Laughter)
I do remember the night my father died,
and I remember the driver of a neighbor
who was driving us to the hospital.
He mumbled something
about "dead people don't tip so well"
and walked away into the dark.
And I was only 14 then,
and I put my father's dead body
in the back seat of the car,
and my mother besides me,
I started driving back
from the hospital to the house.
And in the middle of her quiet crying,
my mother looked at me and she said,
"Son, when did you learn to drive?"
And I thought about it
and realized, and I said to my mom,
"Just now, Mom."
(Laughter)
So from that night onwards,
much akin to humanity in its adolescence,
I learned the crude tools of survival.
And the framework of life was
very, very simple then, to be honest.
You know, you just ate what you got
and did whatever you were told to do.
I thought celiac was a vegetable,
and vegan, of course, was Mr. Spock's
lost comrade in "Star Trek."
(Laughter)
You married the first girl that you dated,
and you were a techie if you could fix
the carburetor in your car.
I really thought that gay was
a sophisticated English word for happy.
And Lesbian, of course, was the capital
of Portugal, as you all know.
(Laughter)
Where was I?
We relied on systems
created through the toil and sacrifice
of generations before
to protect us,
and we felt that governments
actually worked for our betterment.
Science was simple and logical,
Apple was still then just a fruit
owned by Eve first and then Newton,
not by Steve Jobs, until then.
And "Eureka!" was what you screamed
when you wanted
to run naked on the streets.
You went wherever life took you for work,
and people were mostly welcoming of you.
Migration was a term then
still reserved for Siberian cranes,
not human beings.
Most importantly, you were who you were
and you said what you thought.
Then in my late 20s,
I shifted to the sprawling
metropolis of Mumbai,
and my framework,
like the newly industrialized
aspirational humanity,
began to alter.
In the urban rush for a new,
more embellished survival,
things started to look a little different.
I met people who had descended
from all over the world,
faces, races, genders, money-lenders.
Definitions became more and more fluid.
Work began to define you at that time
in an overwhelmingly equalizing manner,
and all the systems
started to feel less reliable to me,
almost too thick to hold on
to the diversity of mankind
and the human need to progress and grow.
Ideas were flowing
with more freedom and speed.
And I experienced the miracle
of human innovation and cooperation,
and my own creativity,
when supported by the resourcefulness
of this collective endeavor,
catapulted me into superstardom.
I started to feel that I had arrived,
and generally, by the time I was 40,
I was really, really flying.
I was all over the place.
You know? I'd done 50 films by then
and 200 songs,
and I'd been knighted by the Malaysians.
I had been given the highest civil honor
by the French government,
the title of which for the life of me
I can't pronounce even until now.
(Laughter)
I'm sorry, France, and thank you,
France, for doing that.
But much bigger than that,
I got to meet Angelina Jolie --
(Laughter)
for two and a half seconds.
(Laughter)
And I'm sure she also remembers
that encounter somewhere.
OK, maybe not.
And I sat next to Hannah Montana
on a round dinner table
with her back towards me most of the time.
Like I said, I was flying,
from Miley to Jolie,
and humanity was soaring with me.
We were both pretty much
flying off the handle, actually.
And then you all know what happened.
The internet happened.
I was in my late 40s,
and I started tweeting
like a canary in a birdcage
and assuming that, you know,
people who peered into my world
would admire it
for the miracle I believed it to be.
But something else
awaited me and humanity.
You know, we had expected
an expansion of ideas and dreams
with the enhanced
connectivity of the world.
We had not bargained
for the village-like enclosure of thought,
of judgment, of definition
that flowed from the same place
that freedom and revolution
was taking place in.
Everything I said took a new meaning.
Everything I did -- good, bad, ugly --
was there for the world
to comment upon and judge.
As a matter of fact,
everything I didn't say or do also
met with the same fate.
Four years ago,
my lovely wife Gauri and me
decided to have a third child.
It was claimed on the net
that he was the love child
of our first child
who was 15 years old.
Apparently, he had sown
his wild oats with a girl
while driving her car in Romania.
And yeah, there was
a fake video to go with it.
And we were so disturbed as a family.
My son, who is 19 now,
even now when you say "hello" to him,
he just turns around and says,
"But bro, I didn't even have
a European driving license."
(Laughter)
Yeah.
In this new world,
slowly, reality became virtual
and virtual became real,
and I started to feel
that I could not be who I wanted to be
or say what I actually thought,
and humanity at this time
completely identified with me.
I think both of us
were going through our midlife crisis,
and humanity, like me,
was becoming an overexposed prima donna.
I started to sell everything,
from hair oil to diesel generators.
Humanity was buying everything
from crude oil to nuclear reactors.
You know, I even tried
to get into a skintight superhero suit
to reinvent myself.
I must admit I failed miserably.
And just an aside I want to say
on behalf of all the Batmen, Spider-Men
and Supermen of the world,
you have to commend them,
because it really hurts in the crotch,
that superhero suit.
(Laughter)
Yeah, I'm being honest.
I need to tell you this here.
Really.
And accidentally, I happened
to even invent a new dance form
which I didn't realize,
and it became a rage.
So if it's all right,
and you've seen a bit of me,
so I'm quite shameless, I'll show you.
It was called the Lungi dance.
So if it's all right, I'll just show you.
I'm talented otherwise.
(Cheers)
So it went something like this.
Lungi dance. Lungi dance.
Lungi dance. Lungi dance.
Lungi dance. Lungi dance.
Lungi dance. Lungi dance.
Lungi dance. Lungi dance.
Lungi dance. Lungi.
That's it. It became a rage.
(Cheers)
It really did.
Like you notice, nobody could make
any sense of what was happening except me,
and I didn't give a damn, really,
because the whole world,
and whole humanity,
seemed as confused and lost as I was.
I didn't give up then.
I even tried to reconstruct
my identity on the social media
like everyone else does.
I thought if I put on
philosophical tweets out there
people will think I'm with it,
but some of the responses I got
from those tweets
were extremely confusing acronyms
which I didn't understand. You know?
ROFL, LOL.
"Adidas," somebody wrote back
to one of my more thought-provoking tweets
and I was wondering
why would you name a sneaker,
I mean, why would you write back
the name of a sneaker to me?
And I asked my 16-year-old daughter,
and she enlightened me.
"Adidas" now means
"All day I dream about sex."
(Laughter)
Really.
I didn't know if you know that.
So I wrote back,
"WTF" in bold to Mr. Adidas,
thanking secretly that some acronyms
and things won't change at all.
WTF.
But here we are.
I am 51 years old, like I told you,
and mind-numbing acronyms notwithstanding,
I just want to tell you
if there has been a momentous time
for humanity to exist,
it is now,
because the present you is brave.
The present you is hopeful.
The present you
is innovative and resourceful,
and of course, the present you
is annoyingly indefinable.
And in this spell-binding,
imperfect moment of existence,
feeling a little brave
just before I came here,
I decided to take
a good, hard look at my face.
And I realized that I'm beginning
to look more and more
like the wax statue of me
at Madame Tussaud's.
(Laughter)
Yeah, and in that moment of realization,
I asked the most central
and pertinent question to humanity and me:
Do I need to fix my face?
Really. I'm an actor, like I told you,
a modern expression of human creativity.
The land I come from
is the source of inexplicable
but very simple spirituality.
In its immense generosity,
India decided somehow
that I, the Muslim son
of a broke freedom fighter
who accidentally ventured
into the business of selling dreams,
should become its king of romance,
the "Badhshah of Bollywood,"
the greatest lover
the country has ever seen ...
with this face.
Yeah.
(Laughter)
Which has alternately
been described as ugly, unconventional,
and strangely, not chocolatey enough.
(Laughter)
The people of this ancient land
embraced me in their limitless love,
and I've learned from these people
that neither power nor poverty
can make your life more magical
or less tortuous.
I've learned from the people of my country
that the dignity of a life,
a human being, a culture,
a religion, a country
actually resides in its ability
for grace and compassion.
I've learned that whatever moves you,
whatever urges you to create, to build,
whatever keeps you from failing,
whatever helps you survive,
is perhaps the oldest and the simplest
emotion known to mankind,
and that is love.
A mystic poet from my land famously wrote,
(Recites poem in Hindi)
(Poem ends)
Which loosely translates
into that whatever --
yeah, if you know Hindi,
please clap, yeah.
(Applause)
It's very difficult to remember.
Which loosely translates
into actually saying
that all the books of knowledge
that you might read
and then go ahead
and impart your knowledge
through innovation,
through creativity, through technology,
but mankind will never be
the wiser about its future
unless it is coupled with a sense of love
and compassion for their fellow beings.
The two and a half alphabets
which form the word "प्रेम,"
which means "love,"
if you are able to understand that
and practice it,
that itself is enough
to enlighten mankind.
So I truly believe the future "you"
has to be a you that loves.
Otherwise it will cease to flourish.
It will perish in its own self-absorption.
So you may use your power
to build walls
and keep people outside,
or you may use it to break barriers
and welcome them in.
You may use your faith
to make people afraid
and terrify them into submission,
or you can use it
to give courage to people
so they rise to the greatest
heights of enlightenment.
You can use your energy
to build nuclear bombs
and spread the darkness of destruction,
or you can use it to spread
the joy of light to millions.
You may filthy up the oceans callously
and cut down all the forests.
You can destroy the ecology,
or turn to them with love
and regenerate life
from the waters and trees.
You may land on Mars
and build armed citadels,
or you may look for life-forms and species
to learn from and respect.
And you can use
all the moneys we all have earned
to wage futile wars
and give guns in the hands
of little children
to kill each other with,
or you can use it
to make more food
to fill their stomachs with.
My country has taught me
the capacity for a human being to love
is akin to godliness.
It shines forth in a world
which civilization, I think,
already has tampered too much with.
In the last few days,
the talks here, the wonderful people
coming and showing their talent,
talking about individual achievements,
the innovation, the technology,
the sciences, the knowledge
we are gaining by being here
in the presence of TED Talks
and all of you
are reasons enough
for us to celebrate the future "us."
But within that celebration
the quest to cultivate
our capacity for love and compassion
has to assert itself,
has to assert itself,
just as equally.
So I believe the future "you"
is an infinite you.
It's called a chakra
in India, like a circle.
It ends where it begins from
to complete itself.
A you that perceives
time and space differently
understands both
your unimaginable
and fantastic importance
and your complete unimportance
in the larger context of the universe.
A you that returns back
to the original innocence of humanity,
which loves from the purity of heart,
which sees from the eyes of truth,
which dreams from the clarity
of an untampered mind.
The future "you" has to be
like an aging movie star
who has been made to believe
that there is a possibility
of a world which is completely,
wholly, self-obsessively
in love with itself.
A world -- really, it has to be a you
to create a world
which is its own best lover.
That I believe, ladies and gentlemen,
should be the future "you."
Thank you very much.
Shukriya.
(Applause)
Thank you.
(Applause)
Thank you.
(Applause)
Well after many years working in trade and economics,
four years ago,
I found myself working on the front lines
of human vulnerability.
And I found myself in the places
where people are fighting every day to survive
and can't even obtain a meal.
This red cup comes from Rwanda
from a child named Fabian.
And I carry this around
as a symbol, really, of the challenge
and also the hope.
Because one cup of food a day
changes Fabian's life completely.
But what I'd like to talk about today
is the fact that this morning,
about a billion people on Earth --
or one out of every seven --
woke up and didn't even know
how to fill this cup.
One out of every seven people.
First, I'll ask you: Why should you care?
Why should we care?
For most people,
if they think about hunger,
they don't have to go far back on their own family history --
maybe in their own lives, or their parents' lives,
or their grandparents' lives --
to remember an experience of hunger.
I rarely find an audience
where people can go back very far without that experience.
Some are driven by compassion,
feel it's perhaps
one of the fundamental acts of humanity.
As Gandhi said,
"To a hungry man, a piece of bread is the face of God."
Others worry about peace and security,
stability in the world.
We saw the food riots in 2008,
after what I call the silent tsunami of hunger
swept the globe when food prices doubled overnight.
The destabilizing effects of hunger
are known throughout human history.
One of the most fundamental acts of civilization
is to ensure people can get enough food.
Others think about Malthusian nightmares.
Will we be able to feed a population
that will be nine billion in just a few decades?
This is not a negotiable thing, hunger.
People have to eat.
There's going to be a lot of people.
This is jobs and opportunity all the way up and down the value chain.
But I actually came to this issue
in a different way.
This is a picture of me and my three children.
In 1987, I was a new mother
with my first child
and was holding her and feeding her
when an image very similar to this
came on the television.
And this was yet another famine in Ethiopia.
One two years earlier
had killed more than a million people.
But it never struck me as it did that moment,
because on that image
was a woman trying to nurse her baby,
and she had no milk to nurse.
And the baby's cry really penetrated me,
as a mother.
And I thought, there's nothing more haunting
than the cry of a child
that cannot be returned with food --
the most fundamental expectation of every human being.
And it was at that moment
that I just was filled
with the challenge and the outrage
that actually we know how to fix this problem.
This isn't one of those rare diseases
that we don't have the solution for.
We know how to fix hunger.
A hundred years ago, we didn't.
We actually have the technology and systems.
And I was just struck
that this is out of place.
At our time in history, these images are out of place.
Well guess what?
This is last week in northern Kenya.
Yet again,
the face of starvation
at large scale
with more than nine million people
wondering if they can make it to the next day.
In fact,
what we know now
is that every 10 seconds
we lose a child to hunger.
This is more
than HIV/AIDS,
malaria and tuberculosis combined.
And we know that the issue
is not just production of food.
One of my mentors in life
was Norman Borlaug, my hero.
But today I'm going to talk about access to food,
because actually this year and last year
and during the 2008 food crisis,
there was enough food on Earth
for everyone to have 2,700 kilocalories.
So why is it
that we have a billion people
who can't find food?
And I also want to talk about
what I call our new burden of knowledge.
In 2008,
Lancet compiled all the research
and put forward the compelling evidence
that if a child in its first thousand days --
from conception to two years old --
does not have adequate nutrition,
the damage is irreversible.
Their brains and bodies will be stunted.
And here you see a brain scan of two children --
one who had adequate nutrition,
another, neglected
and who was deeply malnourished.
And we can see brain volumes
up to 40 percent less
in these children.
And in this slide
you see the neurons and the synapses of the brain
don't form.
And what we know now is this has huge impact on economies,
which I'll talk about later.
But also the earning potential of these children
is cut in half in their lifetime
due to the stunting
that happens in early years.
So this burden of knowledge drives me.
Because actually we know how to fix it
very simply.
And yet, in many places,
a third of the children,
by the time they're three
already are facing a life of hardship
due to this.
I'd like to talk about
some of the things I've seen on the front lines of hunger,
some of the things I've learned
in bringing my economic and trade knowledge
and my experience in the private sector.
I'd like to talk about where the gap of knowledge is.
Well first, I'd like to talk about the oldest nutritional method on Earth,
breastfeeding.
You may be surprised to know
that a child could be saved every 22 seconds
if there was breastfeeding in the first six months of life.
But in Niger, for example,
less than seven percent of the children
are breastfed
for the first six months of life, exclusively.
In Mauritania, less than three percent.
This is something that can be transformed with knowledge.
This message, this word, can come out
that this is not an old-fashioned way of doing business;
it's a brilliant way
of saving your child's life.
And so today we focus on not just passing out food,
but making sure the mothers have enough enrichment,
and teaching them about breastfeeding.
The second thing I'd like to talk about:
If you were living in a remote village somewhere,
your child was limp,
and you were in a drought, or you were in floods,
or you were in a situation where there wasn't adequate diversity of diet,
what would you do?
Do you think you could go to the store
and get a choice of power bars, like we can,
and pick the right one to match?
Well I find parents out on the front lines
very aware their children are going down for the count.
And I go to those shops, if there are any,
or out to the fields to see what they can get,
and they cannot obtain the nutrition.
Even if they know what they need to do, it's not available.
And I'm very excited about this,
because one thing we're working on
is transforming the technologies
that are very available
in the food industry
to be available for traditional crops.
And this is made with chickpeas, dried milk
and a host of vitamins,
matched to exactly what the brain needs.
It costs 17 cents for us to produce this
as, what I call, food for humanity.
We did this with food technologists
in India and Pakistan --
really about three of them.
But this is transforming
99 percent of the kids who get this.
One package, 17 cents a day --
their malnutrition is overcome.
So I am convinced
that if we can unlock the technologies
that are commonplace in the richer world
to be able to transform foods.
And this is climate-proof.
It doesn't need to be refrigerated, it doesn't need water,
which is often lacking.
And these types of technologies,
I see, have the potential
to transform the face of hunger and nutrition, malnutrition
out on the front lines.
The next thing I want to talk about is school feeding.
Eighty percent of the people in the world
have no food safety net.
When disaster strikes --
the economy gets blown, people lose a job,
floods, war, conflict,
bad governance, all of those things --
there is nothing to fall back on.
And usually the institutions --
churches, temples, other things --
do not have the resources
to provide a safety net.
What we have found working with the World Bank
is that the poor man's safety net,
the best investment, is school feeding.
And if you fill the cup
with local agriculture from small farmers,
you have a transformative effect.
Many kids in the world can't go to school
because they have to go beg and find a meal.
But when that food is there,
it's transformative.
It costs less than 25 cents a day to change a kid's life.
But what is most amazing is the effect on girls.
In countries where girls don't go to school
and you offer a meal to girls in school,
we see enrollment rates
about 50 percent girls and boys.
We see a transformation in attendance by girls.
And there was no argument,
because it's incentive.
Families need the help.
And we find that if we keep girls in school later,
they'll stay in school until they're 16,
and won't get married if there's food in school.
Or if they get an extra ration of food
at the end of the week --
it costs about 50 cents --
will keep a girl in school,
and they'll give birth to a healthier child,
because the malnutrition is sent
generation to generation.
We know that there's boom and bust cycles of hunger.
We know this.
Right now on the Horn of Africa, we've been through this before.
So is this a hopeless cause?
Absolutely not.
I'd like to talk about what I call our warehouses for hope.
Cameroon, northern Cameroon, boom and bust cycles of hunger
every year for decades.
Food aid coming in every year
when people are starving during the lean seasons.
Well two years ago,
we decided, let's transform the model of fighting hunger,
and instead of giving out the food aid, we put it into food banks.
And we said, listen,
during the lean season, take the food out.
You manage, the village manages these warehouses.
And during harvest, put it back with interest,
food interest.
So add in five percent, 10 percent more food.
For the past two years,
500 of these villages where these are
have not needed any food aid -- they're self-sufficient.
And the food banks are growing.
And they're starting school feeding programs for their children
by the people in the village.
But they've never had the ability
to build even the basic infrastructure
or the resources.
I love this idea that came from the village level:
three keys to unlock that warehouse.
Food is gold there.
And simple ideas can transform the face,
not of small areas,
of big areas of the world.
I'd like to talk about what I call digital food.
Technology is transforming
the face of food vulnerability
in places where you see classic famine.
Amartya Sen won his Nobel Prize
for saying, "Guess what, famines happen in the presence of food
because people have no ability to buy it."
We certainly saw that in 2008.
We're seeing that now in the Horn of Africa
where food prices are up 240 percent in some areas
over last year.
Food can be there and people can't buy it.
Well this picture -- I was in Hebron in a small shop, this shop,
where instead of bringing in food,
we provide digital food, a card.
It says "bon appetit" in Arabic.
And the women can go in and swipe
and get nine food items.
They have to be nutritious,
and they have to be locally produced.
And what's happened in the past year alone
is the dairy industry --
where this card's used for milk and yogurt
and eggs and hummus --
the dairy industry has gone up 30 percent.
The shopkeepers are hiring more people.
It is a win-win-win situation
that starts the food economy moving.
We now deliver food in over 30 countries
over cell phones,
transforming even the presence of refugees in countries,
and other ways.
Perhaps most exciting to me
is an idea that Bill Gates, Howard Buffett and others
have supported boldly,
which is to ask the question:
What if, instead of looking at the hungry as victims --
and most of them are small farmers
who cannot raise enough food or sell food
to even support their own families --
what if we view them as the solution,
as the value chain to fight hunger?
What if from the women in Africa
who cannot sell any food --
there's no roads, there's no warehouses,
there's not even a tarp to pick the food up with --
what if we give the enabling environment
for them to provide the food
to feed the hungry children elsewhere?
And Purchasing for Progress today is in 21 countries.
And guess what?
In virtually every case,
when poor farmers are given a guaranteed market --
if you say, "We will buy 300 metric tons of this.
We'll pick it up. We'll make sure it's stored properly." --
their yields have gone up two-, three-, fourfold
and they figure it out,
because it's the first guaranteed opportunity they've had in their life.
And we're seeing people transform their lives.
Today, food aid, our food aid --
huge engine --
80 percent of it is bought in the developing world.
Total transformation
that can actually transform the very lives that need the food.
Now you'd ask, can this be done at scale?
These are great ideas, village-level ideas.
Well I'd like to talk about Brazil,
because I've taken a journey to Brazil over the past couple of years,
when I read that Brazil was defeating hunger
faster than any nation on Earth right now.
And what I've found is,
rather than investing their money in food subsidies
and other things,
they invested in a school feeding program.
And they require that a third of that food
come from the smallest farmers who would have no opportunity.
And they're doing this at huge scale
after President Lula declared his goal
of ensuring everyone had three meals a day.
And this zero hunger program
costs .5 percent of GDP
and has lifted many millions of people
out of hunger and poverty.
It is transforming the face of hunger in Brazil,
and it's at scale, and it's creating opportunities.
I've gone out there; I've met with the small farmers
who have built their livelihoods
on the opportunity and platform
provided by this.
Now if we look at the economic imperative here,
this isn't just about compassion.
The fact is studies show
that the cost of malnutrition and hunger --
the cost to society,
the burden it has to bear --
is on average six percent,
and in some countries up to 11 percent,
of GDP a year.
And if you look at the 36 countries
with the highest burden of malnutrition,
that's 260 billion lost from a productive economy
every year.
Well, the World Bank estimates
it would take about 10 billion dollars --
10.3 --
to address malnutrition in those countries.
You look at the cost-benefit analysis,
and my dream is to take this issue,
not just from the compassion argument,
but to the finance ministers of the world,
and say we cannot afford
to not invest
in the access to adequate, affordable nutrition
for all of humanity.
The amazing thing I've found
is nothing can change on a big scale
without the determination of a leader.
When a leader says, "Not under my watch,"
everything begins to change.
And the world can come in
with enabling environments and opportunities to do this.
And the fact that France
has put food at the center of the G20
is really important.
Because food is one issue
that cannot be solved person by person, nation by nation.
We have to stand together.
And we're seeing nations in Africa.
WFP's been able to leave 30 nations
because they have transformed
the face of hunger in their nations.
What I would like to offer here is a challenge.
I believe we're living at a time in human history
where it's just simply unacceptable
that children wake up
and don't know where to find a cup of food.
Not only that,
transforming hunger
is an opportunity,
but I think we have to change our mindsets.
I am so honored to be here
with some of the world's top innovators and thinkers.
And I would like you to join with all of humanity
to draw a line in the sand
and say, "No more.
No more are we going to accept this."
And we want to tell our grandchildren
that there was a terrible time in history
where up to a third of the children
had brains and bodies that were stunted,
but that exists no more.
Thank you.
(Applause)
I have a confession to make.
But first, I want you to make
a little confession to me.
In the past year,
I want you to just raise your hand
if you've experienced
relatively little stress.
Anyone?
How about a moderate amount of stress?
Who has experienced a lot of stress?
Yeah. Me too.
But that is not my confession.
My confession is this:
I am a health psychologist,
and my mission is to help people
be happier and healthier.
But I fear that something
I've been teaching
for the last 10 years
is doing more harm than good,
and it has to do with stress.
For years I've been telling people,
stress makes you sick.
It increases the risk of everything
from the common cold
to cardiovascular disease.
Basically, I've turned stress
into the enemy.
But I have changed my mind about stress,
and today, I want to change yours.
Let me start with the study
that made me rethink
my whole approach to stress.
This study tracked 30,000 adults
in the United States for eight years,
and they started by asking people,
"How much stress have you
experienced in the last year?"
They also asked,
"Do you believe that stress
is harmful for your health?"
And then they used public death records
to find out who died.
(Laughter)
Okay.
Some bad news first.
People who experienced a lot of stress
in the previous year
had a 43 percent increased risk of dying.
But that was only true for the people
who also believed that stress
is harmful for your health.
(Laughter)
People who experienced a lot of stress
but did not view stress as harmful
were no more likely to die.
In fact, they had the lowest risk of dying
of anyone in the study,
including people
who had relatively little stress.
Now the researchers estimated
that over the eight years
they were tracking deaths,
182,000 Americans died prematurely,
not from stress,
but from the belief
that stress is bad for you.
(Laughter)
That is over 20,000 deaths a year.
Now, if that estimate is correct,
that would make
believing stress is bad for you
the 15th largest cause of death
in the United States last year,
killing more people than skin cancer,
HIV/AIDS and homicide.
(Laughter)
You can see why this study freaked me out.
Here I've been spending
so much energy telling people
stress is bad for your health.
So this study got me wondering:
Can changing how you think
about stress make you healthier?
And here the science says yes.
When you change your mind about stress,
you can change
your body's response to stress.
Now to explain how this works,
I want you all to pretend
that you are participants
in a study designed to stress you out.
It's called the social stress test.
You come into the laboratory,
and you're told you have to give
a five-minute impromptu speech
on your personal weaknesses
to a panel of expert evaluators
sitting right in front of you,
and to make sure you feel the pressure,
there are bright lights
and a camera in your face,
kind of like this.
(Laughter)
And the evaluators have been trained
to give you discouraging,
non-verbal feedback,
like this.
(Exhales)
(Laughter)
Now that you're sufficiently demoralized,
time for part two: a math test.
And unbeknownst to you,
the experimenter has been trained
to harass you during it.
Now we're going to all do this together.
It's going to be fun.
For me.
Okay.
(Laughter)
I want you all to count backwards from 996
in increments of seven.
You're going to do this out loud,
as fast as you can,
starting with 996.
Go!
(Audience counting)
Go faster. Faster please.
You're going too slow.
(Audience counting)
Stop. Stop, stop, stop.
That guy made a mistake.
We are going to have to start
all over again.
(Laughter)
You're not very good at this, are you?
Okay, so you get the idea.
If you were actually in this study,
you'd probably be a little stressed out.
Your heart might be pounding,
you might be breathing faster,
maybe breaking out into a sweat.
And normally, we interpret
these physical changes as anxiety
or signs that we aren't coping
very well with the pressure.
But what if you viewed them instead
as signs that your body was energized,
was preparing you to meet this challenge?
Now that is exactly
what participants were told
in a study conducted
at Harvard University.
Before they went
through the social stress test,
they were taught to rethink
their stress response as helpful.
That pounding heart
is preparing you for action.
If you're breathing faster,
it's no problem.
It's getting more oxygen to your brain.
And participants who learned to view
the stress response
as helpful for their performance,
well, they were less stressed out,
less anxious, more confident,
but the most fascinating finding to me
was how their physical
stress response changed.
Now, in a typical stress response,
your heart rate goes up,
and your blood vessels
constrict like this.
And this is one of the reasons
that chronic stress
is sometimes associated
with cardiovascular disease.
It's not really healthy to be
in this state all the time.
But in the study,
when participants viewed
their stress response as helpful,
their blood vessels
stayed relaxed like this.
Their heart was still pounding,
but this is a much healthier
cardiovascular profile.
It actually looks a lot like what happens
in moments of joy and courage.
Over a lifetime of stressful experiences,
this one biological change
could be the difference
between a stress-induced
heart attack at age 50
and living well into your 90s.
And this is really what the new
science of stress reveals,
that how you think about stress matters.
So my goal as a health
psychologist has changed.
I no longer want
to get rid of your stress.
I want to make you better at stress.
And we just did a little intervention.
If you raised your hand and said
you'd had a lot of stress
in the last year,
we could have saved your life,
because hopefully the next time
your heart is pounding from stress,
you're going to remember this talk
and you're going to think to yourself,
this is my body helping me
rise to this challenge.
And when you view stress in that way,
your body believes you,
and your stress response
becomes healthier.
Now I said I have over a decade
of demonizing stress
to redeem myself from,
so we are going to do
one more intervention.
I want to tell you
about one of the most under-appreciated
aspects of the stress response,
and the idea is this:
Stress makes you social.
To understand this side of stress,
we need to talk about a hormone, oxytocin,
and I know oxytocin has already gotten
as much hype as a hormone can get.
It even has its own cute nickname,
the cuddle hormone,
because it's released
when you hug someone.
But this is a very small part
of what oxytocin is involved in.
Oxytocin is a neuro-hormone.
It fine-tunes
your brain's social instincts.
It primes you to do things
that strengthen close relationships.
Oxytocin makes you crave physical contact
with your friends and family.
It enhances your empathy.
It even makes you more willing
to help and support
the people you care about.
Some people have even suggested
we should snort oxytocin...
to become more compassionate and caring.
But here's what most people
don't understand about oxytocin.
It's a stress hormone.
Your pituitary gland pumps this stuff out
as part of the stress response.
It's as much a part
of your stress response
as the adrenaline that makes
your heart pound.
And when oxytocin is released
in the stress response,
it is motivating you to seek support.
Your biological stress response
is nudging you to tell
someone how you feel,
instead of bottling it up.
Your stress response wants
to make sure you notice
when someone else
in your life is struggling
so that you can support each other.
When life is difficult,
your stress response wants you
to be surrounded
by people who care about you.
Okay, so how is knowing this side
of stress going to make you healthier?
Well, oxytocin doesn't only act
on your brain.
It also acts on your body,
and one of its main roles in your body
is to protect your cardiovascular system
from the effects of stress.
It's a natural anti-inflammatory.
It also helps your blood vessels
stay relaxed during stress.
But my favorite effect on the body
is actually on the heart.
Your heart has receptors for this hormone,
and oxytocin helps heart cells regenerate
and heal from any stress-induced damage.
This stress hormone
strengthens your heart.
And the cool thing
is that all of these physical benefits
of oxytocin are enhanced
by social contact and social support.
So when you reach out
to others under stress,
either to seek support
or to help someone else,
you release more of this hormone,
your stress response becomes healthier,
and you actually recover
faster from stress.
I find this amazing,
that your stress response
has a built-in mechanism
for stress resilience,
and that mechanism is human connection.
I want to finish by telling you
about one more study.
And listen up, because this study
could also save a life.
This study tracked about 1,000 adults
in the United States,
and they ranged in age from 34 to 93,
and they started the study by asking,
"How much stress have you
experienced in the last year?"
They also asked,
"How much time have you spent
helping out friends, neighbors,
people in your community?"
And then they used public records
for the next five years
to find out who died.
Okay, so the bad news first:
For every major stressful life experience,
like financial difficulties
or family crisis,
that increased the risk
of dying by 30 percent.
But -- and I hope you
are expecting a "but" by now --
but that wasn't true for everyone.
People who spent time caring for others
showed absolutely no stress-related
increase in dying.
Zero.
Caring created resilience.
And so we see once again
that the harmful effects
of stress on your health
are not inevitable.
How you think and how you act
can transform your experience of stress.
When you choose to view
your stress response as helpful,
you create the biology of courage.
And when you choose to connect
with others under stress,
you can create resilience.
Now I wouldn't necessarily ask
for more stressful experiences in my life,
but this science has given me
a whole new appreciation for stress.
Stress gives us access to our hearts.
The compassionate heart
that finds joy and meaning
in connecting with others,
and yes, your pounding physical heart,
working so hard to give you
strength and energy.
And when you choose to view
stress in this way,
you're not just getting better at stress,
you're actually making
a pretty profound statement.
You're saying that you can trust yourself
to handle life's challenges.
And you're remembering
that you don't have to face them alone.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Chris Anderson: This is kind
of amazing, what you're telling us.
It seems amazing to me
that a belief about stress
can make so much difference
to someone's life expectancy.
How would that extend to advice,
like, if someone is making
a lifestyle choice
between, say, a stressful job
and a non-stressful job,
does it matter which way they go?
It's equally wise to go
for the stressful job
so long as you believe
that you can handle it, in some sense?
KM: Yeah, and one thing
we know for certain
is that chasing meaning
is better for your health
than trying to avoid discomfort.
And so I would say that's really
the best way to make decisions,
is go after what it is
that creates meaning in your life
and then trust yourself to handle
the stress that follows.
CA: Thank you so much, Kelly.
It's pretty cool.
(Applause)
Meet Tony. He's my student.
He's about my age,
and he's in San Quentin State Prison.
When Tony was 16 years old,
one day, one moment,
"It was mom's gun.
Just flash it, scare the guy. He's a punk.
He took some money; we'll take his money. That'll teach him.
Then last minute, I'm thinking, 'Can't do this. This is wrong.'
My buddy says, 'C'mon, let's do this.'
I say, 'Let's do this.'"
And those three words, Tony's going to remember,
because the next thing he knows, he hears the pop.
There's the punk on the ground, puddle of blood.
And that's felony murder --
25 to life, parole at 50 if you're lucky,
and Tony's not feeling very lucky.
So when we meet in my philosophy class in his prison
and I say, "In this class, we will discuss the foundations of ethics,"
Tony interrupts me.
"What are you going to teach me about right and wrong?
I know what is wrong. I have done wrong.
I am told every day,
by every face I see, every wall I face, that I am wrong.
If I ever get out of here, there will always be a mark by my name.
I'm a convict; I am branded 'wrong.'
What are you going to tell me about right and wrong?"
So I say to Tony,
"Sorry, but it's worse than you think.
You think you know right and wrong?
Then can you tell me what wrong is?
No, don't just give me an example.
I want to know about wrongness itself, the idea of wrong.
What is that idea?
What makes something wrong?
How do we know that it's wrong? Maybe you and I disagree.
Maybe one of us is wrong about the wrong.
Maybe it's you, maybe it's me -- but we're not here to trade opinions;
everyone's got an opinion.
We are here for knowledge.
Our enemy is thoughtlessness. This is philosophy."
And something changes for Tony.
"Could be I'm wrong. I'm tired of being wrong.
I want to know what is wrong.
I want to know what I know."
What Tony sees in that moment is the project of philosophy,
the project that begins in wonder --
what Kant called "admiration and awe
at the starry sky above and the moral law within."
What can creatures like us know of such things?
It is the project that always takes us back to the condition of existence --
what Heidegger called "the always already there."
It is the project of questioning what we believe and why we believe it --
what Socrates called "the examined life."
Socrates, a man wise enough to know that he knows nothing.
Socrates died in prison,
his philosophy intact.
So Tony starts doing his homework.
He learns his whys and wherefores, his causes and correlations,
his logic, his fallacies.
Turns out, Tony's got the philosophy muscle.
His body is in prison, but his mind is free.
Tony learns about the ontologically promiscuous,
the epistemologically anxious,
the ethically dubious, the metaphysically ridiculous.
That's Plato, Descartes, Nietzsche
and Bill Clinton.
So when he gives me his final paper,
in which he argues that the categorical imperative
is perhaps too uncompromising
to deal with the conflict that affects our everyday
and challenges me to tell him
whether therefore we are condemned to moral failure,
I say, "I don't know.
Let us think about that."
Because in that moment, there's no mark by Tony's name;
it's just the two of us standing there.
It is not professor and convict,
it is just two minds ready to do philosophy.
And I say to Tony,
"Let's do this."
Thank you.
(Applause)
The Highline
is an old, elevated rail line
that runs for a mile and a half right through Manhattan.
And it was originally a freight line
that ran down 10th Ave.
And it became known as "Death Avenue"
because so many people were run over by the trains
that the railroad hired a guy on horseback to run in front,
and he became known as the "West Side Cowboy."
But even with a cowboy,
about one person a month
was killed and run over.
So they elevated it.
They built it 30 ft. in the air, right through the middle of the city.
But with the rise of interstate trucking,
it was used less and less.
And by 1980, the last train rode.
It was a train loaded with frozen turkeys -- they say, at Thanksgiving --
from the meatpacking district.
And then it was abandoned.
And I live in the neighborhood,
and I first read about it in the New York Times,
in an article that said it was going to be demolished.
And I assumed someone was working
to preserve it or save it
and I could volunteer,
but I realized no one was doing anything.
I went to my first community board meeting --
which I'd never been to one before --
and sat next to another guy named Joshua David,
who's a travel writer.
And at the end of the meeting, we realized
we were the only two people that were sort of interested in the project;
most people wanted to tear it down.
So we exchanged business cards,
and we kept calling each other
and decided to start this organization,
Friends of the High Line.
And the goal at first
was just saving it from demolition,
but then we also wanted to figure out what we could do with it.
And what first attracted me, or interested me,
was this view from the street --
which is this steel structure,
sort of rusty,
this industrial relic.
But when I went up on top,
it was a mile and a half of wildflowers
running right through the middle of Manhattan
with views of the Empire State Building
and the Statue of Liberty and the Hudson River.
And that's really where we started,
the idea coalesced around, let's make this a park,
and let's have it be sort of inspired
by this wildscape.
At the time, there was a lot of opposition.
Mayor Giuliani wanted to tear it down.
I'm going to fast-forward through a lot of lawsuits
and a lot of community engagement.
Mayor Bloomberg came in office, he was very supportive,
but we still had to make the economic case.
This was after 9/11;
the city was in tough times.
So we commissioned an economic feasibility study
to try to make the case.
And it turns out, we got those numbers wrong.
We thought it would cost 100 million dollars to build.
So far it's cost about 150 million.
And the main case was,
this is going to make good economic sense for the city.
So we said over a 20-year time period,
the value to the city in increased property values
and increased taxes
would be about 250 million.
That was enough. It really got the city behind it.
It turns out we were wrong on that.
Now people estimate it's created about a half a billion dollars,
or will create about a half a billion dollars,
in tax revenues for the city.
We did a design competition,
selected a design team.
We worked with them to really create a design
that was inspired by that wildscape.
There's three sections.
We opened the fist section in 2009.
It's been successful beyond our dreams.
Last year we had about two million people,
which is about 10 times what we ever estimated.
This is one of my favorite features in section one.
It's this amphitheater right over 10th Ave.
And the first section ends at 20th St. right now.
The other thing, it's generated, obviously, a lot of economic value;
it's also inspired, I think, a lot of great architecture.
There's a point, you can stand here
and see buildings by Frank Gehry,
Jean Nouvel, Shigeru Ban,
Neil Denari.
And the Whitney is moving downtown
and is building their new museum right at the base of the High Line.
And this has been designed by Renzo Piano.
And they're going to break ground in May.
And we've already started construction on section two.
This is one of my favorite features,
this flyover where you're eight feet
off the surface of the High Line,
running through a canopy of trees.
The High Line used to be covered in billboards,
and so we've taken a playful take
where, instead of framing advertisements,
it's going to frame people in views of the city.
This was just installed last month.
And then the last section was going to go around the rail yards,
which is the largest undeveloped site
in Manhattan.
And the city has planned -- for better or for worse --
12 million square-feet of development
that the High Line is going to ring around.
But what really, I think, makes the High Line special
is the people.
And honestly, even though I love the designs that we were building,
I was always frightened that I wouldn't really love it,
because I fell in love with that wildscape --
and how could you recreate that magic?
But what I found
is it's in the people and how they use it
that, to me, makes it so special.
Just one quick example
is I realized right after we opened
that there were all these people holding hands on the High Line.
And I realized New Yorkers don't hold hands;
we just don't do that outside.
But you see that happening on the High Line,
and I think that's the power
that public space can have
to transform how people experience their city
and interact with each other.
Thanks.
(Applause)
For emotions, we should not move quickly to the desert.
So, first, a small housekeeping announcement:
please switch off your
proper English check programs
installed in your brain.
(Applause)
So, welcome to the Golden Desert, Indian desert.
It receives the least rainfall in the country,
lowest rainfall.
If you are well-versed with inches, nine inches,
centimeters, 16 [centimeters].
The groundwater is 300 feet deep, 100 meters.
And in most parts it is saline, not fit for drinking.
So, you can't install hand pumps or dig wells,
though there is no electricity in most of the villages.
But suppose you use the green technology, solar pumps --
they are of no use in this area.
So, welcome to the Golden Desert.
Clouds seldom visit this area.
But we find 40 different names of clouds in this dialect used here.
There are a number of techniques to harvest rain.
This is a new work, it's a new program.
But for the desert society
this is no program; this is their life.
And they harvest rain in many ways.
So, this is the first device they use
in harvesting rain.
It's called kunds; somewhere it is called [unclear].
And you can notice they have created
a kind of false catchment.
The desert is there, sand dunes, some small field.
And this is all big raised platform.
You can notice the small holes
the water will fall on this catchment,
and there is a slope.
Sometimes our engineers and architects
do not care about slopes in bathrooms,
but here they will care properly.
And the water will go where it should go.
And then it is 40 feet deep.
The waterproofing is done perfectly,
better than our city contractors,
because not a single drop should go waste in this.
They collect 100 thousand liters in one season.
And this is pure drinking water.
Below the surface there is hard saline water.
But now you can have this for year round.
It's two houses.
We often use a term called bylaws.
Because we are used to get written things.
But here it is unwritten by law.
And people made their house,
and the water storage tanks.
These raised up platforms just like this stage.
In fact they go 15 feet deep,
and collect rain water from roof,
there is a small pipe, and from their courtyard.
It can also harvest something like 25,000 in a good monsoon.
Another big one,
this is of course out of the hardcore desert area.
This is near Jaipur. This is called the Jaigarh Fort.
And it can collect six million gallons of rainwater in one season.
The age is 400 years.
So, since 400 years it has been giving you
almost six million gallons of water per season.
You can calculate the price of that water.
It draws water from 15 kilometers of canals.
You can see a modern road, hardly 50 years old.
It can break sometimes.
But this 400 year old canal, which draws water,
it is maintained for so many generations.
Of course if you want to go inside, the two doors are locked.
But they can be opened for TED people.
(Laughter)
And we request them.
You can see person coming up with
two canisters of water.
And the water level -- these are not empty canisters --
water level is right up to this.
It can envy many municipalities,
the color, the taste, the purity of this water.
And this is what they call Zero B type of water,
because it comes from the clouds,
pure distilled water.
We stop for a quick commercial break,
and then we come back to the traditional systems.
The government thought that this is a very
backward area and we should bring
a multi-million dollar project
to bring water from the Himalayas.
That's why I said that this is a commercial break.
(Laughter)
But we will come back, once again,
to the traditional thing.
So, water from 300, 400 kilometers away,
soon it become like this.
In many portions, water hyacinth
covered these big canals like anything.
Of course there are some areas where water is reaching,
I'm not saying that it is not reaching at all.
But the tail end, the Jaisalmer area,
you will notice in Bikaner things like this:
where the water hyacinth couldn't grow,
the sand is flowing in these canals.
The bonus is that you can find wildlife around it.
(Laughter)
We had full-page advertisements,
some 30 years, 25 years ago when this canal came.
They said that throw away your traditional systems,
these new cement tanks will supply you piped water.
It's a dream. And it became a dream also.
Because soon the water was not able to reach these areas.
And people started renovating their own structures.
These are all traditional water structures,
which we won't be able to explain in such a short time.
But you can see that no woman is standing on those.
(Laughter)
And they are plaiting hair.
(Applause)
Jaisalmer. This is heart of desert.
This town was established 800 years ago.
I'm not sure by that time
Bombay was there, or Delhi was there,
or Chennai was there, or Bangalore was there.
So, this was the terminal point for silk route.
Well connected, 800 years ago, through Europe.
None of us were able to go to Europe,
but Jaisalmer was well connected to it.
And this is the 16 centimeter area.
Such a limited rainfall,
and highest colorful life flourished in these areas.
You won't find water in this slide.
But it is invisible.
Somewhere a stream or a rivulet
is running through here.
Or, if you want to paint, you can paint it blue throughout
because every roof which you see in this picture
collects rainwater drops
and deposit in the rooms.
But apart from this system,
they designed 52 beautiful water bodies around this town.
And what we call private public partnership
you can add estate also.
So, estate, public and private entrepreneurs
work together to build this beautiful water body.
And it's a kind of water body for all seasons.
You will admire it. Just behold the beauty throughout the year.
Whether water level goes up or down,
the beauty is there throughout.
Another water body, dried up, of course,
during the summer period,
but you can see how the traditional society
combines engineering with aesthetics, with the heart.
These statues, marvelous statues,
gives you an idea of water table.
When this rain comes and the water starts filling this tank,
it will submerge these beautiful statues
in what we call in English today "mass communication."
This was for mass communication.
Everybody in the town will know that this elephant has drowned,
so water will be there for seven months or nine months,
or 12 months.
And then they will come and worship this pond,
pay respect, their gratitude.
Another small water body, called the [unclear].
It is difficult to translate in English,
especially in my English.
But the nearest would be "glory," a reputation.
The reputation in desert of this small water body is
that it never dries up.
In severe drought periods
nobody has seen this water body
getting dried up.
And perhaps they knew the future also.
It was designed some 150 years ago.
But perhaps they knew that on sixth, November, 2009,
there will be a TED green and blue session,
so they painted it like this.
(Laughter)
(Applause)
Dry water body. Children are standing on
a very difficult device to explain.
This is called kund. We have, in English, surface water and ground water.
But this is not ground water.
You can draw ground water from any well.
But this is no ordinary well.
It squeeze the moisture
hidden in the sand.
And they have dubbed this water as the third one called [unclear].
And there is a gypsum belt running below it.
And it was deposited by the great mother Earth,
some three million years ago.
And where we have this gypsum strip
they can harvest this water.
This is the same dry water body.
Now, you don't find any kund;
they are all submerged.
But when the water goes down they will be able
to draw water from those structures throughout the year.
This year they have received only six centimeters.
Six centimeter of rainfall,
and they can telephone you
that if you find any water problem in your city,
Delhi, Bombay, Bangalore, Mysore,
please come to our area of six centimeters, we can give you water.
(Laughter)
How they maintain them?
There are three things: concept, planning,
making the actual thing, and also maintaining them.
It is a structure for maintain,
for centuries, by generations, without any department,
without any funding,
So the secret is "[unclear]," respect.
Your own thing, not personal property,
my property, every time.
So, these stone pillars
will remind you that you are entering into a water body area.
Don't spit, don't do anything wrong,
so that the clean water can be collected.
Another pillar, stone pillar on your right side.
If you climb these three, six steps
you will find something very nice.
This was done in 11th century.
And you have to go further down.
They say that a picture is worth a thousand words,
so we can say a thousand words right now,
an another thousand words.
If the water table goes down,
you will find new stairs.
If it comes up, some of them will be submerged.
So, throughout the year
this beautiful system will give you some pleasure.
Three sides, such steps, on the fourth side
there is a four-story building
where you can organize such TED conferences anytime.
(Applause)
Excuse me, who built these structures?
They are in front of you.
The best civil engineers we had, the best planners,
the best architects.
We can say that because of them,
because of their forefathers,
India could get the first engineering college
in 1847.
There were no English medium schools at that time,
even no Hindi schools, [unclear] schools.
But such people, compelled to the East India Company,
which came here for business, a very dirty kind of business ...
(Laughter)
but not to create the engineering colleges.
But because of them, first engineering college was created
in a small village, not in the town.
The last point, we all know in our primary schools that
that camel is a ship of desert.
So, you can find through your Jeep,
a camel, and a cart.
This tire comes from the airplane.
So, look at the beauty from the desert society
who can harvest rainwater,
and also create something
through a tire from a jet plane,
and used in a camel cart.
Last picture, it's a tattoo,
2,000-years-old tattoo.
They were using it on their body.
Tattoo was, at one time,
a kind of a blacklisted
or con thing, but now it is in thing.
(Laughter)
(Applause)
You can copy this tattoo. I have some posters of this.
(Laughter)
The center of life is water.
These are the beautiful waves.
These are the beautiful stairs
which we just saw in one of the slides.
These are the trees.
And these are the flowers which
add fragrance to our lives.
So, this is the message of desert.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
Chris Anderson: So, first of all, I wish I had your eloquence, truly, in any language.
(Applause)
These artifacts and designs are inspiring.
Do you believe that they can be used elsewhere,
that the world can learn from this?
Or is this just right for this place?
Anupam Mishra: No, the basic idea is to
utilize water that falls on our area.
So, the ponds, the open bodies, are everywhere,
right from Sri Lanka to Kashmir, and in other parts also.
And these [unclear], which stored water,
there are two type of things.
One recharge, and one stores.
So, it depends on the terrain.
But kund, which uses the gypsum belt,
for that you have to go back to your calendar,
three million years ago.
If it is there it can be done right now.
Otherwise, it can't be done.
(Laughter)
(Applause)
CA: Thank you so much.
(Applause)
I would like to demonstrate
for the first time in public
that it is possible to transmit a video
from a standard off-the-shelf LED lamp
to a solar cell with a laptop
acting as a receiver.
There is no Wi-Fi involved,
it's just light.
And you may wonder, what's the point?
And the point is this:
There will be a massive
extension of the Internet
to close the digital divide,
and also to allow for what we call
"The Internet of Things" --
tens of billions of devices
connected to the Internet.
In my view, such an extension
of the Internet can only work
if it's almost energy-neutral.
This means we need to use existing
infrastructure as much as possible.
And this is where the solar cell
and the LED come in.
I demonstrated for the first time,
at TED in 2011,
Li-Fi, or Light Fidelity.
Li-Fi uses off-the-shelf LEDs
to transmit data incredibly fast,
and also in a safe and secure manner.
Data is transported by the light,
encoded in subtle changes
of the brightness.
If we look around,
we have many LEDs around us,
so there's a rich infrastructure
of Li-Fi transmitters around us.
But so far, we have been using
special devices -- small photo detectors,
to receive the information
encoded in the data.
I wanted to find a way to also use
existing infrastructure
to receive data from our Li-Fi lights.
And this is why I have been looking into
solar cells and solar panels.
A solar cell absorbs light
and converts it into electrical energy.
This is why we can use a solar cell
to charge our mobile phone.
But now we need to remember
that the data is encoded in subtle changes
of the brightness of the LED,
so if the incoming light fluctuates,
so does the energy harvested
from the solar cell.
This means we have
a principal mechanism in place
to receive information from the light
and by the solar cell,
because the fluctuations
of the energy harvested
correspond to the data transmitted.
Of course the question is:
can we receive very fast and subtle
changes of the brightness,
such as the ones transmitted
by our LED lights?
And the answer to that is yes, we can.
We have shown in the lab
that we can receive up to 50
megabytes per second
from a standard, off-the-shelf solar cell.
And this is faster than most
broadband connections these days.
Now let me show you in practice.
In this box is a standard,
off-the-shelf LED lamp.
This is a standard,
off-the-shelf solar cell;
it is connected to the laptop.
And also we have an instrument here
to visualize the energy
we harvest from the solar cell.
And this instrument shows
something at the moment.
This is because the solar cell already
harvests light from the ambient light.
Now what I would like to do first
is switch on the light,
and I'll simply, only switch on the light,
for a moment,
and what you'll notice is that
the instrument jumps to the right.
So the solar cell, for a moment,
is harvesting energy
from this artificial light source.
If I turn it off, we see it drops.
I turn it on ...
So we harvest energy with the solar cell.
But next I would like to activate
the streaming of the video.
And I've done this
by pressing this button.
So now this LED lamp here
is streaming a video
by changing the brightness of the LED
in a very subtle way,
and in a way that you can't
recognize with your eye,
because the changes
are too fast to recognize.
But in order to prove the point,
I can block the light of the solar cell.
So first you notice
the energy harvesting drops
and the video stops as well.
If I remove the blockage,
the video will restart.
(Applause)
And I can repeat that.
So we stop the transmission of the video
and energy harvesting stops as well.
So that is to show that the solar cell
acts as a receiver.
But now imagine that this LED lamp
is a street light, and there's fog.
And so I want to simulate fog,
and that's why I brought
a handkerchief with me.
(Laughter)
And let me put the handkerchief
over the solar cell.
First you notice
the energy harvested drops, as expected,
but now the video still continues.
This means, despite the blockage,
there's sufficient light coming through
the handkerchief to the solar cell,
so that the solar cell is able to decode
and stream that information,
in this case, a high-definition video.
What's really important here is that
a solar cell has become a receiver
for high-speed wireless signals
encoded in light,
while it maintains its primary function
as an energy-harvesting device.
That's why it is possible
to use existing solar cells
on the roof of a hut
to act as a broadband receiver
from a laser station on a close by hill,
or indeed, lamp post.
And It really doesn't matter
where the beam hits the solar cell.
And the same is true
for translucent solar cells
integrated into windows,
solar cells integrated
into street furniture,
or indeed, solar cells integrated
into these billions of devices
that will form the Internet of Things.
Because simply,
we don't want to charge
these devices regularly,
or worse, replace the batteries
every few months.
As I said to you,
this is the first time
I've shown this in public.
It's very much a lab demonstration,
a prototype.
But my team and I are confident
that we can take this to market
within the next two to three years.
And we hope we will be able to contribute
to closing the digital divide,
and also contribute
to connecting all these billions
of devices to the Internet.
And all of this without causing
a massive explosion
of energy consumption --
because of the solar cells,
quite the opposite.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Good morning everybody.
I work with really amazing,
little, itty-bitty creatures called cells.
And let me tell you what it's like
to grow these cells in the lab.
I work in a lab where we take cells out of their native environment.
We plate them into dishes
that we sometimes call petri dishes.
And we feed them -- sterilely of course --
with what we call cell culture media -- which is like their food --
and we grow them in incubators.
Why do I do this?
We observe the cells in a plate,
and they're just on the surface.
But what we're really trying to do in my lab
is to engineer tissues out of them.
What does that even mean?
Well it means growing an actual heart,
let's say,
or grow a piece of bone
that can be put into the body.
Not only that, but they can also be used for disease models.
And for this purpose, traditional cell culture techniques
just really aren't enough.
The cells are kind of homesick;
the dish doesn't feel like their home.
And so we need to do better at copying their natural environment
to get them to thrive.
We call this the biomimetic paradigm --
copying nature in the lab.
Let's take the example of the heart,
the topic of a lot of my research.
What makes the heart unique?
Well, the heart beats,
rhythmically, tirelessly, faithfully.
We copy this in the lab
by outfitting cell culture systems with electrodes.
These electrodes act like mini pacemakers
to get the cells to contract in the lab.
What else do we know about the heart?
Well, heart cells are pretty greedy.
Nature feeds the heart cells in your body
with a very, very dense blood supply.
In the lab, we micro-pattern channels
in the biomaterials
on which we grow the cells,
and this allows us to flow the cell culture media, the cells' food,
through the scaffolds where we're growing the cells --
a lot like what you might expect
from a capillary bed in the heart.
So this brings me to lesson number one:
life can do a lot with very little.
Let's take the example of electrical stimulation.
Let's see how powerful just one of these essentials can be.
On the left, we see a tiny piece of beating heart tissue
that I engineered from rat cells in the lab.
It's about the size of a mini marshmallow.
And after one week, it's beating.
You can see it in the upper left-hand corner.
But don't worry if you can't see it so well.
It's amazing that these cells beat at all.
But what's really amazing
is that the cells, when we electrically stimulate them,
like with a pacemaker,
that they beat so much more.
But that brings me to lesson number two:
cells do all the work.
In a sense, tissue engineers have a bit of an identity crisis here,
because structural engineers
build bridges and big things,
computer engineers, computers,
but what we are doing
is actually building enabling technologies for the cells themselves.
What does this mean for us?
Let's do something really simple.
Let's remind ourselves
that cells are not an abstract concept.
Let's remember that our cells sustain our lives
in a very real way.
"We are what we eat," could easily be described
as, "We are what our cells eat."
And in the case of the flora in our gut,
these cells may not even be human.
But it's also worth noting
that cells also mediate our experience of life.
Behind every sound, sight, touch, taste and smell
is a corresponding set of cells
that receive this information
and interpret it for us.
It begs the question:
shall we expand our sense of environmental stewardship
to include the ecosystem of our own bodies?
I invite you to talk about this with me further,
and in the meantime, I wish you luck.
May none of your non-cancer cells
become endangered species.
Thank you.
(Applause)
I'd like to take you to another world.
And I'd like to share
a 45 year-old love story
with the poor,
living on less than one dollar a day.
I went to a very elitist, snobbish,
expensive education in India,
and that almost destroyed me.
I was all set
to be a diplomat, teacher, doctor --
all laid out.
Then, I don't look it, but I was the Indian national squash champion
for three years.
(Laughter)
The whole world was laid out for me.
Everything was at my feet.
I could do nothing wrong.
And then I thought out of curiosity
I'd like to go and live and work
and just see what a village is like.
So in 1965,
I went to what was called the worst Bihar famine in India,
and I saw starvation, death,
people dying of hunger, for the first time.
It changed my life.
I came back home,
told my mother,
"I'd like to live and work in a village."
Mother went into a coma.
(Laughter)
"What is this?
The whole world is laid out for you, the best jobs are laid out for you,
and you want to go and work in a village?
I mean, is there something wrong with you?"
I said, "No, I've got the best eduction.
It made me think.
And I wanted to give something back
in my own way."
"What do you want to do in a village?
No job, no money,
no security, no prospect."
I said, "I want to live
and dig wells for five years."
"Dig wells for five years?
You went to the most expensive school and college in India,
and you want to dig wells for five years?"
She didn't speak to me for a very long time,
because she thought I'd let my family down.
But then,
I was exposed to the most extraordinary knowledge and skills
that very poor people have,
which are never brought into the mainstream --
which is never identified, respected,
applied on a large scale.
And I thought I'd start a Barefoot College --
college only for the poor.
What the poor thought was important
would be reflected in the college.
I went to this village for the first time.
Elders came to me
and said, "Are you running from the police?"
I said, "No."
(Laughter)
"You failed in your exam?"
I said, "No."
"You didn't get a government job?" I said, "No."
"What are you doing here?
Why are you here?
The education system in India
makes you look at Paris and New Delhi and Zurich;
what are you doing in this village?
Is there something wrong with you you're not telling us?"
I said, "No, I want to actually start a college
only for the poor.
What the poor thought was important would be reflected in the college."
So the elders gave me some very sound and profound advice.
They said, "Please,
don't bring anyone with a degree and qualification
into your college."
So it's the only college in India
where, if you should have a Ph.D. or a Master's,
you are disqualified to come.
You have to be a cop-out or a wash-out or a dropout
to come to our college.
You have to work with your hands.
You have to have a dignity of labor.
You have to show that you have a skill that you can offer to the community
and provide a service to the community.
So we started the Barefoot College,
and we redefined professionalism.
Who is a professional?
A professional is someone
who has a combination of competence,
confidence and belief.
A water diviner is a professional.
A traditional midwife
is a professional.
A traditional bone setter is a professional.
These are professionals all over the world.
You find them in any inaccessible village around the world.
And we thought that these people should come into the mainstream
and show that the knowledge and skills that they have
is universal.
It needs to be used, needs to be applied,
needs to be shown to the world outside --
that these knowledge and skills
are relevant even today.
So the college works
following the lifestyle and workstyle of Mahatma Gandhi.
You eat on the floor, you sleep on the floor, you work on the floor.
There are no contracts, no written contracts.
You can stay with me for 20 years, go tomorrow.
And no one can get more than $100 a month.
You come for the money, you don't come to Barefoot College.
You come for the work and the challenge,
you'll come to the Barefoot College.
That is where we want you to try crazy ideas.
Whatever idea you have, come and try it.
It doesn't matter if you fail.
Battered, bruised, you start again.
It's the only college where the teacher is the learner
and the learner is the teacher.
And it's the only college where we don't give a certificate.
You are certified by the community you serve.
You don't need a paper to hang on the wall
to show that you are an engineer.
So when I said that,
they said, "Well show us what is possible. What are you doing?
This is all mumbo-jumbo if you can't show it on the ground."
So we built the first Barefoot College
in 1986.
It was built by 12 Barefoot architects
who can't read and write,
built on $1.50 a sq. ft.
150 people lived there, worked there.
They got the Aga Khan Award for Architecture in 2002.
But then they suspected, they thought there was an architect behind it.
I said, "Yes, they made the blueprints,
but the Barefoot architects actually constructed the college."
We are the only ones who actually returned the award for $50,000,
because they didn't believe us,
and we thought that they were actually casting aspersions
on the Barefoot architects of Tilonia.
I asked a forester --
high-powered, paper-qualified expert --
I said, "What can you build in this place?"
He had one look at the soil and said, "Forget it. No way.
Not even worth it.
No water, rocky soil."
I was in a bit of a spot.
And I said, "Okay, I'll go to the old man in village
and say, 'What should I grow in this spot?'"
He looked quietly at me and said,
"You build this, you build this, you put this, and it'll work."
This is what it looks like today.
Went to the roof,
and all the women said, "Clear out.
The men should clear out because we don't want to share this technology with the men.
This is waterproofing the roof."
(Laughter)
It is a bit of jaggery, a bit of urens
and a bit of other things I don't know.
But it actually doesn't leak.
Since 1986, it hasn't leaked.
This technology, the women will not share with the men.
(Laughter)
It's the only college
which is fully solar-electrified.
All the power comes from the sun.
45 kilowatts of panels on the roof.
And everything works off the sun for the next 25 years.
So long as the sun shines,
we'll have no problem with power.
But the beauty is
that is was installed
by a priest, a Hindu priest,
who's only done eight years of primary schooling --
never been to school, never been to college.
He knows more about solar
than anyone I know anywhere in the world guaranteed.
Food, if you come to the Barefoot College,
is solar cooked.
But the people who fabricated that solar cooker
are women,
illiterate women,
who actually fabricate
the most sophisticated solar cooker.
It's a parabolic Scheffler solar cooker.
Unfortunately, they're almost half German,
they're so precise.
(Laughter)
You'll never find Indian women so precise.
Absolutely to the last inch,
they can make that cooker.
And we have 60 meals twice a day
of solar cooking.
We have a dentist --
she's a grandmother, illiterate, who's a dentist.
She actually looks after the teeth
of 7,000 children.
Barefoot technology:
this was 1986 -- no engineer, no architect thought of it --
but we are collecting rainwater from the roofs.
Very little water is wasted.
All the roofs are connected underground
to a 400,000 liter tank,
and no water is wasted.
If we have four years of drought, we still have water on the campus,
because we collect rainwater.
60 percent of children don't go to school,
because they have to look after animals --
sheep, goats --
domestic chores.
So we thought of starting a school
at night for the children.
Because the night schools of Tilonia,
over 75,000 children have gone through these night schools.
Because it's for the convenience of the child;
it's not for the convenience of the teacher.
And what do we teach in these schools?
Democracy, citizenship,
how you should measure your land,
what you should do if you're arrested,
what you should do if your animal is sick.
This is what we teach in the night schools.
But all the schools are solar-lit.
Every five years
we have an election.
Between six to 14 year-old children
participate in a democratic process,
and they elect a prime minister.
The prime minister is 12 years old.
She looks after 20 goats in the morning,
but she's prime minister in the evening.
She has a cabinet,
a minister of education, a minister for energy, a minister for health.
And they actually monitor and supervise
150 schools for 7,000 children.
She got the World's Children's Prize five years ago,
and she went to Sweden.
First time ever going out of her village.
Never seen Sweden.
Wasn't dazzled at all by what was happening.
And the Queen of Sweden, who's there,
turned to me and said, "Can you ask this child where she got her confidence from?
She's only 12 years old,
and she's not dazzled by anything."
And the girl, who's on her left,
turned to me and looked at the queen straight in the eye
and said, "Please tell her I'm the prime minister."
(Laughter)
(Applause)
Where the percentage of illiteracy is very high,
we use puppetry.
Puppets is the way we communicate.
You have Jokhim Chacha
who is 300 years old.
He is my psychoanalyst. He is my teacher.
He's my doctor. He's my lawyer.
He's my donor.
He actually raises money,
solves my disputes.
He solves my problems in the village.
If there's tension in the village,
if attendance at the schools goes down
and there's a friction between the teacher and the parent,
the puppet calls the teacher and the parent in front of the whole village
and says, "Shake hands.
The attendance must not drop."
These puppets
are made out of recycled World Bank reports.
(Laughter)
(Applause)
So this decentralized, demystified approach
of solar-electrifying villages,
we've covered all over India
from Ladakh up to Bhutan --
all solar-electrified villages
by people who have been trained.
And we went to Ladakh,
and we asked this woman --
this, at minus 40, you have to come out of the roof,
because there's no place, it was all snowed up on both sides --
and we asked this woman,
"What was the benefit you had
from solar electricity?"
And she thought for a minute and said,
"It's the first time I can see my husband's face in winter."
(Laughter)
Went to Afghanistan.
One lesson we learned in India
was men are untrainable.
(Laughter)
Men are restless,
men are ambitious,
men are compulsively mobile,
and they all want a certificate.
(Laughter)
All across the globe, you have this tendency
of men wanting a certificate.
Why? Because they want to leave the village
and go to a city, looking for a job.
So we came up with a great solution:
train grandmothers.
What's the best way of communicating
in the world today?
Television? No.
Telegraph? No.
Telephone? No.
Tell a woman.
(Laughter)
(Applause)
So we went to Afghanistan for the first time,
and we picked three women
and said, "We want to take them to India."
They said, "Impossible. They don't even go out of their rooms,
and you want to take them to India."
I said, "I'll make a concession. I'll take the husbands along as well."
So I took the husbands along.
Of course, the women were much more intelligent than the men.
In six months,
how do we train these women?
Sign language.
You don't choose the written word.
You don't choose the spoken word.
You use sign language.
And in six months
they can become solar engineers.
They go back and solar-electrify their own village.
This woman went back
and solar-electrified the first village,
set up a workshop --
the first village ever to be solar-electrified in Afghanistan
[was] by the three women.
This woman
is an extraordinary grandmother.
55 years old, and she's solar-electrified 200 houses for me in Afghanistan.
And they haven't collapsed.
She actually went and spoke to an engineering department in Afghanistan
and told the head of the department
the difference between AC and DC.
He didn't know.
Those three women have trained 27 more women
and solar-electrified 100 villages in Afghanistan.
We went to Africa,
and we did the same thing.
All these women sitting at one table from eight, nine countries,
all chatting to each other, not understanding a word,
because they're all speaking a different language.
But their body language is great.
They're speaking to each other
and actually becoming solar engineers.
I went to Sierra Leone,
and there was this minister driving down in the dead of night --
comes across this village.
Comes back, goes into the village, says, "Well what's the story?"
They said, "These two grandmothers ... "
"Grandmothers?" The minister couldn't believe what was happening.
"Where did they go?" "Went to India and back."
Went straight to the president.
He said, "Do you know there's a solar-electrified village in Sierra Leone?"
He said, "No." Half the cabinet went to see the grandmothers the next day.
"What's the story."
So he summoned me and said, "Can you train me 150 grandmothers?"
I said, "I can't, Mr. President.
But they will. The grandmothers will."
So he built me the first Barefoot training center in Sierra Leone.
And 150 grandmothers have been trained in Sierra Leone.
Gambia:
we went to select a grandmother in Gambia.
Went to this village.
I knew which woman I would like to take.
The community got together and said, "Take these two women."
I said, "No, I want to take this woman."
They said, "Why? She doesn't know the language. You don't know her."
I said, "I like the body language. I like the way she speaks."
"Difficult husband; not possible."
Called the husband, the husband came,
swaggering, politician, mobile in his hand. "Not possible."
"Why not?" "The woman, look how beautiful she is."
I said, "Yeah, she is very beautiful."
"What happens if she runs off with an Indian man?"
That was his biggest fear.
I said, "She'll be happy. She'll ring you up on the mobile."
She went like a grandmother
and came back like a tiger.
She walked out of the plane
and spoke to the whole press as if she was a veteran.
She handled the national press,
and she was a star.
And when I went back six months later, I said, "Where's your husband?"
"Oh, somewhere. It doesn't matter."
(Laughter)
Success story.
(Laughter)
(Applause)
I'll just wind up by saying
that I think you don't have to look for solutions outside.
Look for solutions within.
And listen to people. They have the solutions in front of you.
They're all over the world.
Don't even worry.
Don't listen to the World Bank, listen to the people on the ground.
They have all the solutions in the world.
I'll end with a quotation by Mahatma Gandhi.
"First they ignore you,
then they laugh at you,
then they fight you,
and then you win."
Thank you.
(Applause)

[Excerpts from "Myth and Infrastructure"]
Bruno Giussani: Come back.
Miwa Matreyek!
(Applause)
I'm Dr. David Hanson, and I build robots with character.
And by that, I mean
that I develop robots that are characters,
but also robots that will eventually
come to empathize with you.
So we're starting with a variety of technologies
that have converged into these conversational character robots
that can see faces, make eye contact with you,
make a full range of facial expressions, understand speech
and begin to model how you're feeling
and who you are, and build a relationship with you.
I developed a series of technologies
that allowed the robots to make more realistic facial expressions
than previously achieved, on lower power,
which enabled the walking biped robots, the first androids.
So, it's a full range of facial expressions
simulating all the major muscles in the human face,
running on very small batteries,
extremely lightweight.
The materials that allowed the battery-operated facial expressions
is a material that we call Frubber,
and it actually has three major innovations
in the material that allow this to happen.
One is hierarchical pores,
and the other is a macro-molecular nanoscale porosity in the material.
There he's starting to walk.
This is at the Korean Advanced Institute of Science and Technology.
I built the head. They built the body.
So the goal here is to achieve sentience in machines,
and not just sentience, but empathy.
We're working with the Machine Perception Laboratory
at the U.C. San Diego.
They have this really remarkable facial expression technology
that recognizes facial expressions,
what facial expressions you're making.
It also recognizes where you're looking, your head orientation.
We're emulating all the major facial expressions,
and then controlling it with the software
that we call the Character Engine.
And here is a little bit of the technology that's involved in that.
In fact, right now -- plug it from here, and then plug it in here,
and now let's see if it gets my facial expressions.
Okay. So I'm smiling.
(Laughter)
Now I'm frowning.
And this is really heavily backlit.
Okay, here we go.
Oh, it's so sad.
Okay, so you smile, frowning.
So his perception of your emotional states
is very important for machines to effectively become empathetic.
Machines are becoming devastatingly capable
of things like killing. Right?
Those machines have no place for empathy.
And there is billions of dollars being spent on that.
Character robotics could plant the seed
for robots that actually have empathy.
So, if they achieve human level intelligence
or, quite possibly, greater than human levels of intelligence,
this could be the seeds of hope for our future.
So, we've made 20 robots in the last eight years, during the course of getting my Ph.D.
And then I started Hanson Robotics,
which has been developing these things for mass manufacturing.
This is one of our robots
that we showed at Wired NextFest a couple of years ago.
And it sees multiple people in a scene,
remembers where individual people are,
and looks from person to person, remembering people.
So, we're involving two things.
One, the perception of people,
and two, the natural interface,
the natural form of the interface,
so that it's more intuitive for you to interact with the robot.
You start to believe that it's alive and aware.
So one of my favorite projects was bringing all this stuff together
in an artistic display of an android portrait
of science-fiction writer Philip K. Dick,
who wrote great works like, "Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?"
which was the basis of the movie "Bladerunner."
In these stories, robots often think
that they're human, and they sort of come to life.
So we put his writings, letters,
his interviews, correspondences,
into a huge database of thousands of pages,
and then used some natural language processing
to allow you to actually have a conversation with him.
And it was kind of spooky, because he would say these things
that just sounded like they really understood you.
And this is one of the most exciting projects that we're developing,
which is a little character that's a spokesbot
for friendly artificial intelligence, friendly machine intelligence.
And we're getting this mass-manufactured.
We specked it out to actually be doable
with a very, very low-cost bill of materials,
so that it can become a childhood companion for kids.
Interfacing with the Internet, it gets smarter over the years.
As artificial intelligence evolves, so does his intelligence.
Chris Anderson: Thank you so much. That's incredible.
(Applause)
I would like to tell you all
that you are all actually cyborgs,
but not the cyborgs that you think.
You're not RoboCop, and you're not Terminator,
but you're cyborgs every time you look at a computer screen
or use one of your cell phone devices.
So what's a good definition for cyborg?
Well, traditional definition is "an organism
to which exogenous components have been added
for the purpose of adapting to new environments."
That came from a 1960 paper on space travel,
because, if you think about it, space is pretty awkward.
People aren't supposed to be there.
But humans are curious, and they like to add things to their bodies
so they can go to the Alps one day
and then become a fish in the sea the next.
So let's look at the concept of traditional anthropology.
Somebody goes to another country,
says, "How fascinating these people are, how interesting their tools are,
how curious their culture is."
And then they write a paper, and maybe a few other anthropologists read it,
and we think it's very exotic.
Well, what's happening
is that we've suddenly found a new species.
I, as a cyborg anthropologist, have suddenly said,
"Oh, wow. Now suddenly we're a new form of Homo sapiens,
and look at these fascinating cultures,
and look at these curious rituals
that everybody's doing around this technology.
They're clicking on things and staring at screens."
Now there's a reason why I study this,
versus traditional anthropology.
And the reason is that tool use,
in the beginning -- for thousands and thousands of years,
everything has been a physical modification of self.
It has helped us to extend our physical selves,
go faster, hit things harder,
and there's been a limit on that.
But now what we're looking at is not an extension of the physical self,
but an extension of the mental self,
and because of that, we're able to travel faster,
communicate differently.
And the other thing that happens
is that we're all carrying around little Mary Poppins technology.
We can put anything we want into it, and it doesn't get heavier,
and then we can take anything out.
What does the inside of your computer actually look like?
Well, if you print it out, it looks like a thousand pounds of material
that you're carrying around all the time.
And if you actually lose that information,
it means that you suddenly have this loss in your mind,
that you suddenly feel like something's missing,
except you aren't able to see it, so it feels like a very strange emotion.
The other thing that happens is that you have a second self.
Whether you like it or not, you're starting to show up online,
and people are interacting with your second self
when you're not there.
And so you have to be careful
about leaving your front lawn open,
which is basically your Facebook wall,
so that people don't write on it in the middle of the night --
because it's very much the equivalent.
And suddenly we have to start to maintain our second self.
You have to present yourself in digital life
in a similar way that you would in your analog life.
So, in the same way that you wake up, take a shower and get dressed,
you have to learn to do that for your digital self.
And the problem is that a lot of people now,
especially adolescents,
have to go through two adolescences.
They have to go through their primary one, that's already awkward,
and then they go through their second self's adolescence,
and that's even more awkward
because there's an actual history
of what they've gone through online.
And anybody coming in new to technology
is an adolescent online right now,
and so it's very awkward,
and it's very difficult for them to do those things.
So when I was little, my dad would sit me down at night and he would say,
"I'm going to teach you about time and space in the future."
And I said, "Great."
And he said one day, "What's the shortest distance between two points?"
And I said, "Well, that's a straight line. You told me that yesterday."
I thought I was very clever.
He said, "No, no, no. Here's a better way."
He took a piece of paper,
drew A and B on one side and the other
and folded them together so where A and B touched.
And he said, "That is the shortest distance between two points."
And I said, "Dad, dad, dad, how do you do that?"
He said, "Well, you just bend time and space,
it takes an awful lot of energy,
and that's just how you do it."
And I said, "I want to do that."
And he said, "Well, okay."
And so, when I went to sleep for the next 10 or 20 years,
I was thinking at night,
"I want to be the first person to create a wormhole,
to make things accelerate faster.
And I want to make a time machine."
I was always sending messages to my future self
using tape recorders.
But then what I realized when I went to college
is that technology doesn't just get adopted
because it works.
It gets adopted because people use it
and it's made for humans.
So I started studying anthropology.
And when I was writing my thesis on cell phones,
I realized that everyone was carrying around wormholes in their pockets.
They weren't physically transporting themselves;
they were mentally transporting themselves.
They would click on a button,
and they would be connected as A to B immediately.
And I thought, "Oh, wow. I found it. This is great."
So over time, time and space
have compressed because of this.
You can stand on one side of the world,
whisper something and be heard on the other.
One of the other ideas that comes around
is that you have a different type of time on every single device that you use.
Every single browser tab gives you a different type of time.
And because of that, you start to dig around
for your external memories -- where did you leave them?
So now we're all these paleontologists
that are digging for things that we've lost
on our external brains that we're carrying around in our pockets.
And that incites a sort of panic architecture --
"Oh no, where's this thing?"
We're all "I Love Lucy" on a great assembly line of information,
and we can't keep up.
And so what happens is,
when we bring all that into the social space,
we end up checking our phones all the time.
So we have this thing called ambient intimacy.
It's not that we're always connected to everybody,
but at anytime we can connect to anyone we want.
And if you were able to print out everybody in your cell phone,
the room would be very crowded.
These are the people that you have access to right now, in general --
all of these people, all of your friends and family that you can connect to.
And so there are some psychological effects that happen with this.
One I'm really worried about
is that people aren't taking time for mental reflection anymore,
and that they aren't slowing down and stopping,
being around all those people in the room all the time
that are trying to compete for their attention
on the simultaneous time interfaces,
paleontology and panic architecture.
They're not just sitting there.
And really, when you have no external input,
that is a time when there is a creation of self,
when you can do long-term planning,
when you can try and figure out who you really are.
And then, once you do that, you can figure out
how to present your second self in a legitimate way,
instead of just dealing with everything as it comes in --
and oh, I have to do this, and I have to do this, and I have to do this.
And so this is very important.
I'm really worried that, especially kids today,
they're not going to be dealing with this down-time,
that they have an instantaneous button-clicking culture,
and that everything comes to them,
and that they become very excited about it and very addicted to it.
So if you think about it, the world hasn't stopped either.
It has its own external prosthetic devices,
and these devices are helping us all
to communicate and interact with each other.
But when you actually visualize it,
all the connections that we're doing right now --
this is an image of the mapping of the Internet --
it doesn't look technological.
It actually looks very organic.
This is the first time in the entire history of humanity
that we've connected in this way.
And it's not that machines are taking over.
It's that they're helping us to be more human,
helping us to connect with each other.
The most successful technology gets out of the way
and helps us live our lives.
And really,
it ends up being more human than technology,
because we're co-creating each other all the time.
And so this is the important point that I like to study:
that things are beautiful, that it's still a human connection --
it's just done in a different way.
We're just increasing our humanness
and our ability to connect with each other, regardless of geography.
So that's why I study cyborg anthropology.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Did you know that one
of the first fertility drugs
was made from the pee of Catholic nuns,
and that even the Pope got involved?
So, this is totally true.
Back in the 1950s, scientists knew
that when women enter menopause,
they start releasing high levels
of fertility hormones in their urine.
But there was this doctor
named Bruno Lunenfeld,
who wondered if he could actually
isolate those hormones from the urine
and use it to help women
who are having trouble getting pregnant.
Obviously, the problem with this
was that in order to test this idea,
he needed a lot of pee from older women.
And that is not an easy thing to find.
So he and his colleagues
got special permission from the Pope
to collect gallons and gallons of urine
from hundreds of older Catholic nuns.
And in doing so,
he actually isolated hormones
that are still used to help women
get pregnant today,
though now, they can be
synthesized in a lab,
and gallons of pee aren't necessary.
So why am I standing up here,
telling this wonderfully
intellectual audience about nun pee?
Well, I'm a science journalist
and multimedia producer,
who has always been
fascinated by gross stuff.
So fascinated, in fact,
that I started a weekly YouTube series
called "Gross Science,"
all about the slimy, smelly,
creepy underbelly
of nature, medicine and technology.
Now, I think most of us would agree
that there's something
a little gross about pee.
You know, it's something
that we don't really like to talk about,
and we keep the act
of doing it very private.
But when Lunenfeld
peered into the world of pee,
he discovered something
deeply helpful to humanity.
And after a year and a half
of making my show,
I can tell you that very often
when we explore the gross side of life,
we find insights that we never
would have thought we'd find,
and we even often reveal beauty
that we didn't think was there.
I think it's important for us to talk
about gross things for a few reasons.
So, first of all,
talking about gross stuff
is a great tool for education,
and it's an excellent way
to preserve curiosity.
To explain what I mean,
why don't I tell you a little bit
about what I was like as a child?
So, I was what you might call a gross kid.
In fact, my love of science itself
began when my parents bought me
a slime chemistry set
and was then only enhanced
by doing gross experiments
in my sixth-grade biology class.
We did things like, we swabbed
surfaces around our classroom
and cultured the bacteria we'd collected,
and we dissected owl pellets,
which are these balls of material
that are undigested that owls barf up,
and it's really kind of gross
and awesome and cool.
Now, the fact that I was obsessed
with gross stuff as a kid
is not so revolutionary.
You know, lots of kids
are really into gross things,
like playing in dirt or collecting beetles
or eating their boogers.
And why is that?
I think really little kids
are like little explorers.
They just want to experience
as much as they can
and don't have any idea
about the relative acceptability
of touching a ladybug versus a stinkbug.
They just want to understand
how everything works
and experience as much
of life as they can.
And that is pure curiosity.
But then adults step in,
and we tell kids not to pick their noses
and not to touch the slugs or toads
or whatever else they find
in the backyard,
because those things are gross.
And we do that in part
to keep kids safe, right?
Like, maybe picking
your nose spreads germs
and maybe touching that toad
will give you warts,
even though I don't
actually think that's true.
You should feel free to touch
as many toads as you want.
So at a certain point,
when kids get a little bit older,
there's this way
that engaging with gross stuff
isn't just about curiosity,
it's also about, sort of,
finding out where the limits are,
pushing the boundaries of what's OK.
So, lots of kids of a certain age
will have burping competitions
or competitions to see
who can make the grossest face.
And they do that in part because
it's a little bit transgressive, right?
But there's another layer
to why we define stuff as gross.
As humans, we've sort of extended
the concept of disgust to morality.
So, the psychologist Paul Rozin would say
that many of the things
we categorize as gross
are things that reminds us
that we're just animals.
These are things like
bodily fluids and sex
and physical abnormalities and death.
And the idea that we're just animals
can be really unsettling,
because it can be this reminder
of our own mortality.
And that can leave many of us
with this deep existential angst.
Rozin would say that there's this way
in which disgust
and the avoidance of gross things
becomes not just a way
to protect our bodies,
it becomes a way to protect our souls.
I think at a certain point,
kids really begin to internalize
this link between
disgusting things and immorality.
And while I don't have any concrete data
to back up this next idea,
I think that for a lot of us,
it happens around the time we hit puberty.
And you know -- yeah, I know.
So during puberty,
our bodies are changing,
and we're sweating more,
and girls get their periods,
and we're thinking about sex
in this way that we never did before.
And through the human capacity
for abstraction,
this shame can settle in.
So we don't necessarily just think,
"Oh, my goodness, something
really gross is happening to my body!"
We think, "Oh my God, maybe I'm gross.
And maybe that means that there's
something bad or wrong about me."
The thing is, that if you de facto
associate gross stuff with immorality,
you lose a huge part of your curiosity,
because there is so much
out there in the world
that is a little bit gross.
Like, think about going
for a walk in the woods.
You could just pay attention
to the birds and the trees and the flowers
and that would be fine,
but in my view, you'd be missing
a bigger and more awesome picture
of life on this planet.
There are cycles of decay
that are driving forest growth,
and there are networks of fungus
beneath your feet
that are connecting literally
all of the plants around you.
That's really amazing.
So I feel like we should be talking
about gross stuff early and often
with young people,
so they feel like they're actually
allowed to claim this bigger picture
of life on our planet.
The good news is that for many of us,
the fascination with gross stuff
doesn't exactly go away,
we just kind of pretend
like it's not there.
But truthfully, we all spend
sort of a big part of our lives
just trying not to be gross.
When you really think about it,
we're sort of just like bags of fluids
and some weird tissues
surrounded by a thin layer of skin.
And to a certain extent,
multiple times a day, whether
consciously or subconsciously,
I need to remind myself
not to fart publicly.
(Laughter)
You know, we're desperately trying
to avoid being gross all the time,
so I think many of us take
this kind of voyeuristic delight
in learning about gross things.
This is certainly true of kids;
the number of middle school teachers
who show my videos
in their science classes
is a testament to that.
But I think it's totally true
of adults, too.
You know, I think we all love
hearing about gross stories,
because it's a socially acceptable way
to explore the gross side of ourselves.
But there's this other reason
that I think talking about
gross stuff is so important.
A while back, I made a video
on tonsil stones -- sorry, everyone --
which are these balls of mucus
and bacteria and food
that get lodged in your tonsils
and they smell really terrible,
sometimes you cough them up
and it's like -- it's awful.
And many, many people
have experienced this.
But many of the people
who have experienced this
haven't really had a forum
to talk about it.
And today, this video that I made
is my most popular video.
It has millions of views.
(Laughter)
And the comment section for that video
became sort of like a self-help section,
where people could talk about
their tonsil stone experiences
and, like, tips and tricks
for getting rid of them.
And I think it became this great way
for people to talk about something
that they'd never felt comfortable
taking about publicly.
And that is wonderful when it's about
something as goofy as tonsil stones,
but it's a little sad when a video
can have an effect like that
when it's about something
as common as periods.
Last February, I released
a video on menstruation,
and to this day,
I am still getting messages
from people around the globe
who are asking me about their periods.
There are a lot of young people --
and some not-so-young people -- out there,
who are worried that
what's happening to their bodies
is somehow not normal.
And, of course, I always tell them
that I am not a medical professional,
and that, if possible,
they should talk to a doctor.
But the truth of the matter is
that everyone should feel comfortable
talking to a doctor
about their own bodies.
And that's why I think
it's really important for us
to start this dialogue about gross stuff
from a pretty early age,
so we can let our kids know
that it's alright to have agency
over your own body
and over your own health.
There's another reason
that talking to your doctor
about your health and gross stuff
is really, really important.
Doctors and the scientific community
can only address issues
when they know
there's something to address.
So one of the really
interesting things I learned
while making the video on periods,
is that I was talking to this
one scientist who told me
there's actually still a lot
we don't know about periods.
There's a lot of basic research
that still hasn't been done.
In part, that's just because there weren't
a lot of scientists in the field
who were women, to ask questions about it.
And it's also not a topic
that women talk about publicly.
So there's this gap in what we know,
just because no one was there
to ask a question.
There's one final reason that I think
talking about gross stuff is so important,
and that's because you just never know
what you're going to find
when you peel back all those layers
of disgustingness.
So, take the California brown sea hare.
This is a sea slug that squirts
this lovely, bright purple ink
at any creature that tries to eat it.
But it also happens to be
one of the kinkiest creatures
in the animal kingdom.
So these guys are hermaphrodites,
which means they have both
male and female genitalia.
And when it's time to mate,
up to 20 individuals will all get together
in this kind of, like, conga line
and they'll all mate together.
(Laughter)
A single sea hare will inseminate
the partner in front of it
and receive sperm from the one behind,
which is sort of like
an awesome time-saver,
when you think about it.
(Laughter)
But if scientists had only seen this
and they were like,
"OK, we're just not going to
touch that with a stick,"
they would have missed
the bigger thing about sea hares
that makes them really remarkable.
It turns out that these sea hares
have a small number of very large neurons,
which makes them excellent
to use in neuroscience research.
And, in fact, the scientist Eric Kandel
used them in his research
to understand how memories are stored.
And you know what?
He won a Nobel Prize for his work.
So go out there and pick up beetles
and play in dirt and ask questions.
And own your fascination with gross stuff
and don't be ashamed of it,
because you never know
what you're going to find.
And as I say at the end of all my videos,
"Ew."
Thank you.
(Applause)
You may never have heard
of Kenema, Sierra Leone
or Arua, Nigeria.
But I know them as two of the most
extraordinary places on earth.
In hospitals there, there's a community
of nurses, physicians and scientists
that have been quietly battling
one of the deadliest threats
to humanity for years:
Lassa virus.
Lassa virus is a lot like Ebola.
It can cause a severe fever
and can often be fatal.
But these individuals,
they risk their lives every day
to protect the individuals
in their communities,
and by doing so, protect us all.
But one of the most extraordinary things
I learned about them
on one of my first visits
out there many years ago
was that they start each morning --
these challenging, extraordinary days
on the front lines -- by singing.
They gather together,
and they show their joy.
They show their spirit.
And over the years,
from year after year as I've visited them
and they've visited me,
I get to gather with them and I sing
and we write and we love it,
because it reminds us that we're not
just there to pursue science together;
we're bonded through a shared humanity.
And that of course, as you can imagine,
becomes extremely important,
even essential, as things begin to change.
And that changed a great deal
in March of 2014,
when the Ebola outbreak
was declared in Guinea.
This is the first outbreak in West Africa,
near the border
of Sierra Leone and Liberia.
And it was frightening,
frightening for us all.
We had actually suspected for some time
that Lassa and Ebola were more
widespread than thought,
and we thought it could
one day come to Kenema.
And so members of my team
immediately went out
and joined Dr. Humarr Khan
and his team there,
and we set up diagnostics to be able
to have sensitive molecular tests
to pick up Ebola if it came
across the border
and into Sierra Leone.
We'd already set up this kind
of capacity for Lassa virus,
we knew how to do it,
the team is outstanding.
We just had to give them
the tools and place to survey for Ebola.
And unfortunately, that day came.
On May 23, 2014, a woman checked
into the maternity ward at the hospital,
and the team ran
those important molecular tests
and they identified the first
confirmed case of Ebola in Sierra Leone.
This was an exceptional
work that was done.
They were able to diagnose
the case immediately,
to safely treat the patient
and to begin to do contact tracing
to follow what was going on.
It could've stopped something.
But by the time that day came,
the outbreak had already
been breeding for months.
With hundreds of cases, it had already
eclipsed all previous outbreaks.
And it came into Sierra Leone
not as that singular case,
but as a tidal wave.
We had to work
with the international community,
with the Ministry of Health, with Kenema,
to begin to deal with the cases,
as the next week brought 31,
then 92, then 147 cases --
all coming to Kenema,
one of the only places in Sierra Leone
that could deal with this.
And we worked around the clock
trying to do everything we could,
trying to help the individuals,
trying to get attention,
but we also did one other simple thing.
From that specimen that we take
from a patient's blood to detect Ebola,
we can discard it, obviously.
The other thing we can do is, actually,
put in a chemical and deactivate it,
so just place it into a box
and ship it across the ocean,
and that's what we did.
We sent it to Boston, where my team works.
And we also worked around the clock
doing shift work, day after day,
and we quickly generated 99 genomes
of the Ebola virus.
This is the blueprint -- the genome
of a virus is the blueprint.
We all have one.
It says everything that makes up us,
and it tells us so much information.
The results of this kind of work
are simple and they're powerful.
We could actually take
these 99 different viruses,
look at them and compare them,
and we could see, actually,
compared to three genomes
that had been previously
published from Guinea,
we could show that the outbreak
emerged in Guinea months before,
once into the human population,
and from there had been transmitting
from human to human.
Now, that's incredibly important
when you're trying to figure out
how to intervene,
but the important thing
is contact tracing.
We also could see that as the virus
was moving between humans,
it was mutating.
And each of those mutations
are so important,
because the diagnostics, the vaccines,
the therapies that we're using,
are all based on that genome
sequence, fundamentally --
that's what drives it.
And so global health experts
would need to respond,
would have to develop,
to recalibrate everything
that they were doing.
But the way that science works,
the position I was in at that point
is, I had the data,
and I could have worked
in a silo for many, many months,
analyzed the data carefully, slowly,
submitted the paper for publication,
gone through a few back-and-forths,
and then finally when the paper came out,
might release that data.
That's the way the status quo works.
Well, that was not going to work
at this point, right?
We had friends on the front lines
and to us it was just obvious
that what we needed is help,
lots of help.
So the first thing we did is,
as soon as the sequences
came off the machines,
we published it to the web.
We just released it to the whole world
and said, "Help us."
And help came.
Before we knew it,
we were being contacted
from people all over,
surprised to see the data
out there and released.
Some of the greatest
viral trackers in the world
were suddenly part of our community.
We were working together
in this virtual way,
sharing, regular calls, communications,
trying to follow the virus
minute by minute,
to see ways that we could stop it.
And there are so many ways
that we can form communities like that.
Everybody, particularly when the outbreak
started to expand globally,
was reaching out to learn,
to participate, to engage.
Everybody wants to play a part.
The amount of human capacity
out there is just amazing,
and the Internet connects us all.
And could you imagine that instead
of being frightened of each other,
that we all just said, "Let's do this.
Let's work together,
and let's make this happen."
But the problem is that the data
that all of us are using,
Googling on the web, is just too limited
to do what we need to do.
And so many opportunities
get missed when that happens.
So in the early part
of the epidemic from Kenema,
we'd had 106 clinical records
from patients,
and we once again made that
publicly available to the world.
And in our own lab, we could show
that you could take those 106 records,
we could train computers to predict
the prognosis for Ebola patients
to near 100 percent accuracy.
And we made an app
that could release that,
to make that available
to health-care workers in the field.
But 106 is just not enough
to make it powerful,
to validate it.
So we were waiting for more data
to release that.
and the data has still not come.
We are still waiting, tweaking away,
in silos rather than working together.
And this just -- we can't accept that.
Right? You, all of you,
cannot accept that.
It's our lives on the line.
And in fact, actually,
many lives were lost,
many health-care workers,
including beloved colleagues of mine,
five colleagues:
Mbalu Fonnie, Alex Moigboi,
Dr. Humarr Khan, Alice Kovoma
and Mohamed Fullah.
These are just five
of many health-care workers
at Kenema and beyond
that died while the world waited
and while we all worked,
quietly and separately.
See, Ebola, like all threats to humanity,
it's fueled by mistrust
and distraction and division.
When we build barriers amongst ourselves
and we fight amongst ourselves,
the virus thrives.
But unlike all threats to humanity,
Ebola is one where
we're actually all the same.
We're all in this fight together.
Ebola on one person's doorstep
could soon be on ours.
And so in this place
with the same vulnerabilities,
the same strengths,
the same fears, the same hopes,
I hope that we work together with joy.
A graduate student of mine
was reading a book about Sierra Leone,
and she discovered that the word "Kenema,"
the hospital that we work at and the city
where we work in Sierra Leone,
is named after the Mende word
for "clear like a river, translucent
and open to the public gaze."
That was really profound for us,
because without knowing it,
we'd always felt
that in order to honor the individuals
in Kenema where we worked,
we had to work openly, we had to share
and we had to work together.
And we have to do that.
We all have to demand that
of ourselves and others --
to be open to each other
when an outbreak happens,
to fight in this fight together.
Because this is not the first
outbreak of Ebola,
it will not be the last,
and there are many other microbes
out there that are lying in wait,
like Lassa virus and others.
And the next time this happens,
it could happen in a city of millions,
it could start there.
It could be something
that's transmitted through the air.
It could even be
disseminated intentionally.
And I know that that is frightening,
I understand that,
but I know also,
and this experience shows us,
that we have the technology
and we have the capacity
to win this thing,
to win this and have
the upper hand over viruses.
But we can only do it if we do it together
and we do it with joy.
So for Dr. Khan
and for all of those who sacrificed
their lives on the front lines
in this fight with us always,
let us be in this fight with them always.
And let us not let the world be defined
by the destruction wrought by one virus,
but illuminated by billions
of hearts and minds
working in unity.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Marco Tempest: What I'd like to show you today
is something in the way of an experiment.
Today's its debut.
It's a demonstration of augmented reality.
And the visuals you're about to see are not prerecorded.
They are live
and reacting to me in real time.
I like to think of it as a kind of technological magic.
So fingers crossed.
And keep your eyes on the big screen.
Augmented reality
is the melding of the real world
with computer-generated imagery.
It seems the perfect medium
to investigate magic
and ask, why, in a technological age,
we continue to have
this magical sense of wonder.
Magic is deception,
but it is a deception we enjoy.
To enjoy being deceived,
an audience must first
suspend its disbelief.
It was the poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge
who first suggested this receptive state of mind.
Samuel Taylor Coleridge: I try to convey a semblance of truth in my writing
to produce for these shadows of the imagination
a willing suspension of disbelief
that, for a moment,
constitutes poetic faith.
MT: This faith in the fictional is essential
for any kind of theatrical experience.
Without it,
a script is just words.
Augmented reality
is just the latest technology.
And sleight of hand
is just an artful demonstration
of dexterity.
We are all very good at suspending our disbelief.
We do it every day,
while reading novels,
watching television
or going to the movies.
We willingly enter fictional worlds
where we cheer our heroes
and cry for friends we never had.
Without this ability
there is no magic.
It was Jean Robert-Houdin,
France's greatest illusionist,
who first recognized the role of the magician
as a storyteller.
He said something that I've posted on the wall of my studio.
Jean Robert-Houdin: A conjurer is not a juggler.
He is an actor playing the part of a magician.
MT: Which means magic is theater
and every trick
is a story.
The tricks of magic
follow the archetypes of narrative fiction.
There are tales of creation and loss,
death and resurrection,
and obstacles that must be overcome.
Now many of them are intensely dramatic.
Magicians play with fire and steel,
defy the fury of the buzzsaw,
dare to catch a bullet
or attempt a deadly escape.
But audiences don't come to see the magician die,
they come to see him live.
Because the best stories
always have a happy ending.
The tricks of magic have one special element.
They are stories with a twist.
Now Edward de Bono argued
that our brains are pattern matching machines.
He said that magicians deliberately exploit
the way their audiences think.
Edward de Bono: Stage magic relies almost wholly
on the momentum error.
The audience is led to make assumptions or elaborations
that are perfectly reasonable,
but do not, in fact, match
what is being done in front of them.
MT: In that respect,
magic tricks are like jokes.
Jokes lead us down a path
to an expected destination.
But when the scenario we have imagined suddenly flips
into something entirely unexpected,
we laugh.
The same thing happens
when people watch magic tricks.
The finale
defies logic,
gives new insight into the problem,
and audiences express their amazement
with laughter.
It's fun to be fooled.
One of the key qualities of all stories
is that they're made to be shared.
We feel compelled to tell them.
When I do a trick at a party --
(Laughter)
that person will immediately pull their friend over
and ask me to do it again.
They want to share the experience.
That makes my job more difficult,
because, if I want to surprise them,
I need to tell a story that starts the same,
but ends differently --
a trick with a twist
on a twist.
It keeps me busy.
Now experts believe
that stories go beyond our capacity for keeping us entertained.
We think in narrative structures.
We connect events and emotions
and instinctively transform them
into a sequence that can be easily understood.
It's a uniquely human achievement.
We all want to share our stories,
whether it is the trick we saw at the party,
the bad day at the office
or the beautiful sunset we saw on vacation.
Today, thanks to technology,
we can share those stories as never before,
by email, Facebook,
blogs, tweets,
on TED.com.
The tools of social networking,
these are the digital campfires
around which the audience gathers
to hear our story.
We turn facts into similes and metaphors,
and even fantasies.
We polish the rough edges of our lives
so that they feel whole.
Our stories make us the people we are
and, sometimes, the people we want to be.
They give us our identity
and a sense of community.
And if the story is a good one,
it might even make us smile.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Thank you.

So, I teach college students
about inequality and race in education,
and I like to leave my office open
to any of my students
who might just want to see me to chat.
And a few semesters ago,
one of my more cheerful
students, Mahari,
actually came to see me
and mentioned that he was feeling
a bit like an outcast because he's black.
He had just transferred to NYU
from a community college
on a merit scholarship,
and turns out,
only about five percent
of students at NYU are black.
And so I started to remember
that I know that feeling
of being an outsider
in your own community.
It's partially what drew me to my work.
At my university,
I'm one of the few
faculty members of color,
and growing up, I experienced
my family's social mobility,
moving out of apartments
into a nice house,
but in an overwhelmingly
white neighborhood.
I was 12,
and kids would say that were surprised
that I didn't smell like curry.
(Laughter)
That's because school is in the morning,
and I had Eggo waffles for breakfast.
(Laughter)
Curry is for dinner.
(Laughter)
So when Mahari was leaving,
I asked him how he was coping
with feeling isolated.
And he said that despite feeling lonely,
he just threw himself at his work,
that he built strategies around his grit
and his desire to be successful.
A mentor of mine is actually
Dr. Angela Duckworth,
the psychologist at UPenn who has defined
this stick-to-itiveness of grit
as being "the perseverance
and passion for long-term goals."
Angela's book has become a bestseller,
and schools across the country,
particularly charter schools,
have become interested in citing
"grit" as a core value.
But sometimes grit isn't enough,
especially in education.
So when Mahari was leaving my office,
I worried that he might need
something more specific
to combat the challenges
that he mentioned to me.
As a sociologist,
I also study achievement,
but from a slightly different perspective.
I research students who have overcome
immense obstacles
related to their background.
Students from low-income,
often single-parent households,
students who have been homeless,
incarcerated or perhaps undocumented,
or some who have struggled
with substance abuse
or lived through violent or sexual trauma.
So let me tell you about two
of the grittiest people I've met.
Tyrique was raised by a single mother,
and then after high school,
he fell in with the wrong crowd.
He got arrested for armed robbery.
But in prison, he started to work hard.
He took college credit courses,
so when he got out,
he was able to get a master's,
and today he's a manager at a nonprofit.
Vanessa had to move around a lot as a kid,
from the Lower East Side
to Staten Island to the Bronx.
She was raised primarily
by her extended family,
because her own mother
had a heroin addiction.
Yet at 15,
Vanessa had to drop out of school,
and she had a son of her own.
But eventually, she was able
to go to community college,
get her associate's,
then go to an elite college
to finish her bachelor's.
So some people might
hear these stories and say,
"Yes, those two definitely have grit.
They basically pulled themselves up
by the bootstraps."
But that's an incomplete picture,
because what's more important
is that they had factors in their lives
that helped to influence their agency,
or their specific capacity
to actually overcome
the obstacles that they were facing
and navigate the system
given their circumstances.
So, allow me to elaborate.
In prison, Tyrique
was actually aimless at first,
as a 22-year-old on Rikers Island.
This is until an older detainee
took him aside
and asked him to help
with the youth program.
And in mentoring youth,
he started to see his own mistakes
and possibilities in the teens.
This is what got him interested
in taking college-credit courses.
And when he got out,
he got a job with Fortune Society,
where many executives are people
who have been formerly incarcerated.
So then he was able to get
a master's in social work,
and today, he even lectures
at Columbia about prison reform.
And Vanessa ...
well, after the birth of her son,
she happened to find a program
called Vocational Foundation
that gave her 20 dollars biweekly,
a MetroCard
and her first experiences with a computer.
These simple resources
are what helped her get her GED,
but then she suffered
from a very serious kidney failure,
which was particularly problematic
because she was only born with one kidney.
She spent 10 years on dialysis
waiting for a successful transplant.
After that,
her mentors at community college
had kept in touch with her,
and so she was able to go,
and they put her in an honors program.
And that's the pathway
that allowed her to become accepted
to one of the most elite colleges
for women in the country,
and she received her bachelor's at 36,
setting an incredible example
for her young son.
What these stories primarily indicate
is that teaching is social
and benefits from social scaffolding.
There were factors
pushing these two in one direction,
but through tailored
mentorship and opportunities,
they were able to reflect
on their circumstances
and resist negative influences.
They also learned simple skills
like developing a network,
or asking for help --
things many of us in this room can forget
that we have needed from time to time,
or can take for granted.
And when we think of people like this,
we should only think of them
as exceptional, but not as exceptions.
Thinking of them as exceptions absolves us
of the collective responsibility
to help students in similar situations.
When Presidents Bush, Obama
and now even Trump,
have called education
"the civil rights issue of our time,"
perhaps we should treat it that way.
If schools were able to think
about the agency that their students have
and bring to the table
when they push them,
what students learn can become
more relevant to their lives,
and then they can tap into those internal
reservoirs of grit and character.
So this here --
My student Mahari
got accepted to law school
with scholarships,
and not to brag,
but I did write one of his letters
of recommendation.
(Laughter)
And even though I know hard work
is what got him this achievement,
I've seen him find
his voice along the way,
which as someone who's grown up
a little bit shy and awkward,
I know it takes time and support.
So even though
he will rely a lot on his grit
to get him through
that first-year law school grind,
I'll be there as a mentor for him,
check in with him from time to time,
maybe take him out to get some curry ...
(Laughter)
so that he can keep growing his agency
to succeed even more.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Here's an intriguing fact.
In the developed world,
everywhere, women live an average
of six to eight years longer than men do.
Six to eight years longer.
That's, like, a huge gap.
In 2015, the "Lancet" published an article
showing that men in rich countries
are twice as likely to die as women are
at any age.
But there is one place in the world
where men live as long as women.
It's a remote, mountainous zone,
a blue zone,
where super longevity
is common to both sexes.
This is the blue zone in Sardinia,
an Italian island in the Mediterranean,
between Corsica and Tunisia,
where there are six times
as many centenarians
as on the Italian mainland,
less than 200 miles away.
There are 10 times as many centenarians
as there are in North America.
It's the only place
where men live as long as women.
But why?
My curiosity was piqued.
I decided to research the science
and the habits of the place,
and I started with the genetic profile.
I discovered soon enough
that genes account for just
25 percent of their longevity.
The other 75 percent is lifestyle.
So what does it take
to live to 100 or beyond?
What are they doing right?
What you're looking at
is an aerial view of Villagrande.
It's a village at the epicenter
of the blue zone
where I went to investigate this,
and as you can see, architectural beauty
is not its main virtue,
density is:
tightly spaced houses,
interwoven alleys and streets.
It means that the villagers' lives
constantly intersect.
And as I walked through the village,
I could feel hundreds
of pairs of eyes watching me
from behind doorways and curtains,
from behind shutters.
Because like all ancient villages,
Villagrande couldn't have survived
without this structure,
without its walls, without its cathedral,
without its village square,
because defense and social cohesion
defined its design.
Urban priorities changed as we moved
towards the industrial revolution
because infectious disease
became the risk of the day.
But what about now?
Now, social isolation
is the public health risk of our time.
Now, a third of the population says
they have two or fewer people to lean on.
But let's go to Villagrande
now as a contrast
to meet some centenarians.
Meet Giuseppe Murinu.
He's 102, a supercentenarian
and a lifelong resident
of the village of Villagrande.
He was a gregarious man.
He loved to recount stories
such as how he lived like a bird
from what he could find
on the forest floor
during not one but two world wars,
how he and his wife,
who also lived past 100,
raised six children
in a small, homey kitchen
where I interviewed him.
Here he is with his sons
Angelo and Domenico,
both in their 70s
and looking after their father,
and who were quite frankly
very suspicious of me and my daughter
who came along with me
on this research trip,
because the flip side of social cohesion
is a wariness of strangers and outsiders.
But Giuseppe, he wasn't suspicious at all.
He was a happy-go-lucky guy,
very outgoing with a positive outlook.
And I wondered: so is that what it takes
to live to be 100 or beyond,
thinking positively?
Actually, no.
(Laughter)
Meet Giovanni Corrias. He's 101,
the grumpiest person I have ever met.
(Laughter)
And he put a lie to the notion
that you have to be positive
to live a long life.
And there is evidence for this.
When I asked him why he lived so long,
he kind of looked at me
under hooded eyelids and he growled,
"Nobody has to know my secrets."
(Laughter)
But despite being a sourpuss,
the niece who lived with him
and looked after him
called him "Il Tesoro," "my treasure."
And she respected him and loved him,
and she told me, when I questioned
this obvious loss of her freedom,
"You just don't understand, do you?
Looking after this man is a pleasure.
It's a huge privilege for me.
This is my heritage."
And indeed, wherever I went
to interview these centenarians,
I found a kitchen party.
Here's Giovanni with his two nieces,
Maria above him
and beside him his great-niece Sara,
who came when I was there
to bring fresh fruits and vegetables.
And I quickly discovered by being there
that in the blue zone, as people age,
and indeed across their lifespans,
they're always surrounded
by extended family, by friends,
by neighbors, the priest,
the barkeeper, the grocer.
People are always there or dropping by.
They are never left
to live solitary lives.
This is unlike the rest
of the developed world,
where as George Burns quipped,
"Happiness is having a large,
loving, caring family in another city."
(Laughter)
Now, so far we've only met men,
long-living men, but I met women too,
and here you see Zia Teresa.
She, at over 100, taught me
how to make the local specialty,
which is called culurgiones,
which are these large pasta pockets
like ravioli about this size,
this size,
and they're filled
with high-fat ricotta and mint
and drenched in tomato sauce.
And she showed me
how to make just the right crimp
so they wouldn't open,
and she makes them
with her daughters every Sunday
and distributes them
by the dozens to neighbors and friends.
And that's when I discovered
a low-fat, gluten-free diet
is not what it takes
to live to 100 in the blue zone.
(Applause)
Now, these centenarians' stories
along with the science that underpins them
prompted me to ask myself
some questions too,
such as, when am I going to die
and how can I put that day off?
And as you will see,
the answer is not what we expect.
Julianne Holt-Lunstad is a researcher
at Brigham Young University
and she addressed this very question
in a series of studies
of tens of thousands of middle aged people
much like this audience here.
And she looked at every
aspect of their lifestyle:
their diet, their exercise,
their marital status,
how often they went to the doctor,
whether they smoked or drank, etc.
She recorded all of this
and then she and her colleagues
sat tight and waited for seven years
to see who would still be breathing.
And of the people left standing,
what reduced their chances
of dying the most?
That was her question.
So let's now look at her data in summary,
going from the least powerful
predictor to the strongest.
OK?
So clean air, which is great,
it doesn't predict how long you will live.
Whether you have your hypertension treated
is good.
Still not a strong predictor.
Whether you're lean or overweight,
you can stop feeling guilty about this,
because it's only in third place.
How much exercise you get is next,
still only a moderate predictor.
Whether you've had a cardiac event
and you're in rehab and exercising,
getting higher now.
Whether you've had a flu vaccine.
Did anybody here know
that having a flu vaccine
protects you more than doing exercise?
Whether you were drinking and quit,
or whether you're a moderate drinker,
whether you don't smoke,
or if you did, whether you quit,
and getting towards the top predictors
are two features of your social life.
First, your close relationships.
These are the people
that you can call on for a loan
if you need money suddenly,
who will call the doctor
if you're not feeling well
or who will take you to the hospital,
or who will sit with you
if you're having an existential crisis,
if you're in despair.
Those people, that little clutch of people
are a strong predictor, if you have them,
of how long you'll live.
And then something that surprised me,
something that's called
social integration.
This means how much
you interact with people
as you move through your day.
How many people do you talk to?
And these mean both
your weak and your strong bonds,
so not just the people
you're really close to,
who mean a lot to you,
but, like, do you talk to the guy
who every day makes you your coffee?
Do you talk to the postman?
Do you talk to the woman who walks
by your house every day with her dog?
Do you play bridge or poker,
have a book club?
Those interactions
are one of the strongest predictors
of how long you'll live.
Now, this leads me to the next question:
if we now spend more time online
than on any other activity,
including sleeping,
we're now up to 11 hours a day,
one hour more than last year, by the way,
does it make a difference?
Why distinguish
between interacting in person
and interacting via social media?
Is it the same thing as being there
if you're in contact constantly
with your kids through text, for example?
Well, the short answer
to the question is no,
it's not the same thing.
Face-to-face contact releases
a whole cascade of neurotransmitters,
and like a vaccine,
they protect you now in the present
and well into the future.
So simply making
eye contact with somebody,
shaking hands, giving somebody a high-five
is enough to release oxytocin,
which increases your level of trust
and it lowers your cortisol levels.
So it lowers your stress.
And dopamine is generated,
which gives us a little high
and it kills pain.
It's like a naturally produced morphine.
Now, all of this passes
under our conscious radar,
which is why we conflate
online activity with the real thing.
But we do have evidence now,
fresh evidence,
that there is a difference.
So let's look at some of the neuroscience.
Elizabeth Redcay, a neuroscientist
at the University of Maryland,
tried to map the difference
between what goes on in our brains
when we interact in person
versus when we're watching
something that's static.
And what she did was
she compared the brain function
of two groups of people,
those interacting live with her
or with one of her research associates
in a dynamic conversation,
and she compared that
to the brain activity of people
who were watching her talk
about the same subject
but in a canned video, like on YouTube.
And by the way, if you want to know
how she fit two people
in an MRI scanner at the same time,
talk to me later.
So what's the difference?
This is your brain
on real social interaction.
What you're seeing
is the difference in brain activity
between interacting in person
and taking in static content.
In orange, you see the brain areas
that are associated with attention,
social intelligence --
that means anticipating
what somebody else is thinking
and feeling and planning --
and emotional reward.
And these areas become much more engaged
when we're interacting
with a live partner.
Now, these richer brain signatures
might be why recruiters
from Fortune 500 companies
evaluating candidates
thought that the candidates were smarter
when they heard their voices
compared to when they just
read their pitches in a text, for example,
or an email or a letter.
Now, our voices and body language
convey a rich signal.
It shows that we're thinking, feeling,
sentient human beings
who are much more than an algorithm.
Now, this research by Nicholas Epley
at the University of Chicago
Business School
is quite amazing because
it tells us a simple thing.
If somebody hears your voice,
they think you're smarter.
I mean, that's quite a simple thing.
Now, to return to the beginning,
why do women live longer than men?
And one major reason
is that women are more likely
to prioritize and groom
their face-to-face relationships
over their lifespans.
Fresh evidence shows
that these in-person friendships
create a biological force field
against disease and decline.
And it's not just true of humans
but their primate relations,
our primate relations as well.
Anthropologist Joan Silk's work
shows that female baboons
who have a core of female friends
show lower levels of stress
via their cortisol levels,
they live longer and they have
more surviving offspring.
At least three stable relationships.
That was the magic number.
Think about it.
I hope you guys have three.
The power of such face-to-face contact
is really why there are
the lowest rates of dementia
among people who are socially engaged.
It's why women who have breast cancer
are four times more likely
to survive their disease than loners are.
Why men who've had a stroke
who meet regularly to play poker
or to have coffee
or to play old-timer's hockey --
I'm Canadian, after all --
(Laughter)
are better protected
by that social contact
than they are by medication.
Why men who've had a stroke
who meet regularly --
this is something very
powerful they can do.
This face-to-face contact
provides stunning benefits,
yet now almost a quarter of the population
says they have no one to talk to.
We can do something about this.
Like Sardinian villagers,
it's a biological imperative
to know we belong,
and not just the women among us.
Building in-person interaction
into our cities, into our workplaces,
into our agendas
bolsters the immune system,
sends feel-good hormones
surging through the bloodstream and brain
and helps us live longer.
I call this building your village,
and building it and sustaining it
is a matter of life and death.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Helen Walters: Susan, come back.
I have a question for you.
I'm wondering if there's a middle path.
So you talk about the neurotransmitters
connecting when in face-to-face,
but what about digital technology?
We've seen enormous improvements
in digital technology
like FaceTime, things like that.
Does that work too?
I mean, I see my nephew.
He plays Minecraft
and he's yelling at his friends.
It seems like he's connecting pretty well.
Is that useful? Is that helpful?
Susan Pinker: Some of the data
are just emerging.
The data are so fresh
that the digital revolution happened
and the health data trailed behind.
So we're just learning,
but I would say
there are some improvements
that we could make in the technology.
For example, the camera on your laptop
is at the top of the screen,
so for example, when you're
looking into the screen,
you're not actually making eye contact.
So something as simple
as even just looking into the camera
can increase those neurotransmitters,
or maybe changing
the position of the camera.
So it's not identical, but I think
we are getting closer with the technology.
HW: Great. Thank you so much.
SP: Thank you.
(Applause)
I want to start by doing an experiment.
I'm going to play three videos
of a rainy day.
But I've replaced the audio
of one of the videos,
and instead of the sound of rain,
I've added the sound of bacon frying.
So I want you think carefully
which one the clip with the bacon is.
(Rain falls)
(Rain falls)
(Rain falls)
All right.
Actually, I lied.
They're all bacon.
(Bacon sizzles)
(Applause)
My point here isn't really
to make you hungry
every time you see a rainy scene,
but it's to show that our brains
are conditioned to embrace the lies.
We're not looking for accuracy.
So on the subject of deception,
I wanted to quote one
of my favorite authors.
In "The Decay of Lying,"
Oscar Wilde establishes the idea
that all bad art comes from copying
nature and being realistic;
and all great art comes
from lying and deceiving,
and telling beautiful, untrue things.
So when you're watching a movie
and a phone rings,
it's not actually ringing.
It's been added later
in postproduction in a studio.
All of the sounds you hear are fake.
Everything, apart from the dialogue,
is fake.
When you watch a movie and you see
a bird flapping its wings --
(Wings flap)
They haven't really recorded the bird.
It sounds a lot more realistic
if you record a sheet
or shaking kitchen gloves.
(Flaps)
The burning of a cigarette up close --
(Cigarette burns)
It actually sounds a lot more authentic
if you take a small Saran Wrap ball
and release it.
(A Saran Warp ball being released)
Punches?
(Punch)
Oops, let me play that again.
(Punch)
That's often done by sticking
a knife in vegetables,
usually cabbage.
(Cabbage stabbed with a knife)
The next one -- it's breaking bones.
(Bones break)
Well, no one was really harmed.
It's actually ...
breaking celery or frozen lettuce.
(Breaking frozen lettuce or celery)
(Laughter)
Making the right sounds
is not always as easy
as a trip to the supermarket
and going to the vegetable section.
But it's often a lot more
complicated than that.
So let's reverse-engineer together
the creation of a sound effect.
One of my favorite stories
comes from Frank Serafine.
He's a contributor to our library,
and a great sound designer for "Tron"
and "Star Trek" and others.
He was part of the Paramount team
that won the Oscar for best sound
for "The Hunt for Red October."
In this Cold War classic, in the '90s,
they were asked to produce the sound
of the propeller of the submarine.
So they had a small problem:
they couldn't really find
a submarine in West Hollywood.
So basically, what they did is,
they went to a friend's swimming pool,
and Frank performed
a cannonball, or bomba.
They placed an underwater mic
and an overhead mic
outside the swimming pool.
So here's what the underwater
mic sounds like.
(Underwater plunge)
Adding the overhead mic,
it sounded a bit like this:
(Water splashes)
So now they took the sound
and pitched it one octave down,
sort of like slowing down a record.
(Water splashes at lower octave)
And then they removed
a lot of the high frequencies.
(Water splashes)
And pitched it down another octave.
(Water splashes at lower octave)
And then they added
a little bit of the splash
from the overhead microphone.
(Water splashes)
And by looping and repeating that sound,
they got this:
(Propeller churns)
So, creativity and technology put together
in order to create the illusion
that we're inside the submarine.
But once you've created your sounds
and you've synced them to the image,
you want those sounds to live
in the world of the story.
And one the best ways to do
that is to add reverb.
So this is the first audio tool
I want to talk about.
Reverberation, or reverb,
is the persistence of the sound
after the original sound has ended.
So it's sort of like the --
all the reflections from the materials,
the objects and the walls
around the sound.
Take, for example, the sound of a gunshot.
The original sound is less
than half a second long.
(Gunshot)
By adding reverb,
we can make it sound like
it was recorded inside a bathroom.
(Gunshot reverbs in bathroom)
Or like it was recorded
inside a chapel or a church.
(Gunshot reverbs church)
Or in a canyon.
(Gunshot reverbs in canyon)
So reverb gives us a lot of information
about the space between the listener
and the original sound source.
If the sound is the taste,
then reverb is sort of like
the smell of the sound.
But reverb can do a lot more.
Listening to a sound
with a lot less reverberation
than the on-screen action
is going to immediately signify to us
that we're listening to a commentator,
to an objective narrator that's not
participating in the on-screen action.
Also, emotionally intimate
moments in cinema
are often heard with zero reverb,
because that's how it would sound
if someone was speaking inside our ear.
On the completely other side,
adding a lot of reverb to a voice
is going to make us think
that we're listening to a flashback,
or perhaps that we're inside
the head of a character
or that we're listening
to the voice of God.
Or, even more powerful in film,
Morgan Freeman.
(Laughter)
So --
(Applause)
But what are some other tools or hacks
that sound designers use?
Well, here's a really big one.
It's silence.
A few moments of silence
is going to make us pay attention.
And in the Western world,
we're not really used to verbal silences.
They're considered awkward or rude.
So silence preceding verbal communication
can create a lot of tension.
But imagine a really big Hollywood movie,
where it's full of explosions
and automatic guns.
Loud stops being loud
anymore, after a while.
So in a yin-yang way,
silence needs loudness
and loudness needs silence
for either of them to have any effect.
But what does silence mean?
Well, it depends how
it's used in each film.
Silence can place us inside
the head of a character
or provoke thought.
We often relate silences with ...
contemplation,
meditation,
being deep in thought.
But apart from having one meaning,
silence becomes a blank canvas
upon which the viewer is invited
to the paint their own thoughts.
But I want to make it clear:
there is no such thing as silence.
And I know this sounds like the most
pretentious TED Talk statement ever.
But even if you were to enter
a room with zero reverberation
and zero external sounds,
you would still be able to hear
the pumping of your own blood.
And in cinema, traditionally,
there was never a silent moment
because of the sound of the projector.
And even in today's Dolby world,
there's not really any moment of silence
if you listen around you.
There's always some sort of noise.
Now, since there's no such
thing as silence,
what do filmmakers
and sound designers use?
Well, as a synonym,
they often use ambiences.
Ambiences are the unique background sounds
that are specific to each location.
Each location has a unique sound,
and each room has a unique sound,
which is called room tone.
So here's a recording
of a market in Morocco.
(Voices, music)
And here's a recording
of Times Square in New York.
(Traffic sounds, car horns, voices)
Room tone is the addition of all
the noises inside the room:
the ventilation, the heating, the fridge.
Here's a recording
of my apartment in Brooklyn.
(You can hear the ventilation, the boiler,
the fridge and street traffic)
Ambiences work in a most primal way.
They can speak directly
to our brain subconsciously.
So, birds chirping outside your window
may indicate normality,
perhaps because, as a species,
we've been used to that sound
every morning for millions of years.
(Birds chirp)
On the other hand, industrial sounds
have been introduced to us
a little more recently.
Even though I really like
them personally --
they've been used by one
of my heroes, David Lynch,
and his sound designer, Alan Splet --
industrial sounds often carry
negative connotations.
(Machine noises)
Now, sound effects can tap
into our emotional memory.
Occasionally, they can be so significant
that they become a character in a movie.
The sound of thunder may indicate
divine intervention or anger.
(Thunder)
Church bells can remind us
of the passing of time,
or perhaps our own mortality.
(Bells ring)
And breaking of glass can
indicate the end of a relationship
or a friendship.
(Glass breaks)
Scientists believe that dissonant sounds,
for example, brass or wind
instruments played very loud,
may remind us of animal howls in nature
and therefore create a sense
of irritation or fear.
(Brass and wind instruments play)
So now we've spoken
about on-screen sounds.
But occasionally, the source
of a sound cannot be seen.
That's what we call offscreen sounds,
or "acousmatic."
Acousmatic sounds --
well, the term "acousmatic" comes
from Pythagoras in ancient Greece,
who used to teach behind
a veil or curtain for years,
not revealing himself to his disciples.
I think the mathematician
and philosopher thought that,
in that way,
his students might focus
more on the voice,
and his words and its meaning,
rather than the visual of him speaking.
So sort of like the Wizard of Oz,
or "1984's" Big Brother,
separating the voice from its source,
separating cause and effect
sort of creates a sense
of ubiquity or panopticism,
and therefore, authority.
There's a strong tradition
of acousmatic sound.
Nuns in monasteries in Rome and Venice
used to sing in rooms
up in galleries close to the ceiling,
creating the illusion that we're listening
to angels up in the sky.
Richard Wagner famously
created the hidden orchestra
that was placed in a pit
between the stage and the audience.
And one of my heroes, Aphex Twin,
famously hid in dark corners of clubs.
I think what all these masters knew
is that by hiding the source,
you create a sense of mystery.
This has been seen
in cinema over and over,
with Hitchcock,
and Ridley Scott in "Alien."
Hearing a sound without knowing its source
is going to create some sort of tension.
Also, it can minimize certain visual
restrictions that directors have
and can show something
that wasn't there during filming.
And if all this sounds
a little theoretical,
I wanted to play a little video.
(Toy squeaks)
(Typewriter)
(Drums)
(Ping-pong)
(Knives being sharpened)
(Record scratches)
(Saw cuts)
(Woman screams)
What I'm sort of trying
to demonstrate with these tools
is that sound is a language.
It can trick us by transporting
us geographically;
it can change the mood;
it can set the pace;
it can make us laugh
or it can make us scared.
On a personal level, I fell
in love with that language
a few years ago,
and somehow managed to make it
into some sort of profession.
And I think with our work
through the sound library,
we're trying to kind of expand
the vocabulary of that language.
And in that way, we want
to offer the right tools
to sound designers,
filmmakers,
and video game and app designers,
to keep telling even better stories
and creating even more beautiful lies.
So thanks for listening.
(Applause)
I'm a storyteller.
And I would like to tell you
a few personal stories
about what I like to call
"the danger of the single story."
I grew up on a university campus
in eastern Nigeria.
My mother says that I started
reading at the age of two,
although I think four
is probably close to the truth.
So I was an early reader,
and what I read were British
and American children's books.
I was also an early writer,
and when I began to write,
at about the age of seven,
stories in pencil
with crayon illustrations
that my poor mother was obligated to read,
I wrote exactly the kinds
of stories I was reading:
All my characters were
white and blue-eyed,
they played in the snow,
they ate apples,
(Laughter)
and they talked a lot about the weather,
how lovely it was
that the sun had come out.
(Laughter)
Now, this despite the fact
that I lived in Nigeria.
I had never been outside Nigeria.
We didn't have snow, we ate mangoes,
and we never talked about the weather,
because there was no need to.
My characters also drank
a lot of ginger beer,
because the characters
in the British books I read
drank ginger beer.
Never mind that I had no idea
what ginger beer was.
(Laughter)
And for many years afterwards,
I would have a desperate desire
to taste ginger beer.
But that is another story.
What this demonstrates, I think,
is how impressionable
and vulnerable we are
in the face of a story,
particularly as children.
Because all I had read were books
in which characters were foreign,
I had become convinced that books
by their very nature
had to have foreigners in them
and had to be about things with which
I could not personally identify.
Now, things changed
when I discovered African books.
There weren't many of them available,
and they weren't quite as easy to find
as the foreign books.
But because of writers like
Chinua Achebe and Camara Laye,
I went through a mental shift
in my perception of literature.
I realized that people like me,
girls with skin the color of chocolate,
whose kinky hair could not form ponytails,
could also exist in literature.
I started to write
about things I recognized.
Now, I loved those
American and British books I read.
They stirred my imagination.
They opened up new worlds for me.
But the unintended consequence
was that I did not know
that people like me
could exist in literature.
So what the discovery of African writers
did for me was this:
It saved me from having a single story
of what books are.
I come from a conventional,
middle-class Nigerian family.
My father was a professor.
My mother was an administrator.
And so we had, as was the norm,
live-in domestic help, who would often
come from nearby rural villages.
So, the year I turned eight,
we got a new house boy.
His name was Fide.
The only thing my mother told us about him
was that his family was very poor.
My mother sent yams and rice,
and our old clothes, to his family.
And when I didn't finish my dinner,
my mother would say,
"Finish your food! Don't you know?
People like Fide's family have nothing."
So I felt enormous pity for Fide's family.
Then one Saturday,
we went to his village to visit,
and his mother showed us
a beautifully patterned basket
made of dyed raffia
that his brother had made.
I was startled.
It had not occurred to me
that anybody in his family
could actually make something.
All I had heard about them
was how poor they were,
so that it had become impossible for me
to see them as anything else but poor.
Their poverty was my single story of them.
Years later, I thought about this
when I left Nigeria
to go to university in the United States.
I was 19.
My American roommate was shocked by me.
She asked where I had learned
to speak English so well,
and was confused when I said that Nigeria
happened to have English
as its official language.
She asked if she could listen
to what she called my "tribal music,"
and was consequently very disappointed
when I produced my tape of Mariah Carey.
(Laughter)
She assumed that I did not know
how to use a stove.
What struck me was this:
She had felt sorry for me
even before she saw me.
Her default position
toward me, as an African,
was a kind of patronizing,
well-meaning pity.
My roommate had a single story of Africa:
a single story of catastrophe.
In this single story,
there was no possibility of Africans
being similar to her in any way,
no possibility of feelings
more complex than pity,
no possibility of a connection
as human equals.
I must say that before I went to the U.S.,
I didn't consciously identify as African.
But in the U.S., whenever Africa came up,
people turned to me.
Never mind that I knew nothing
about places like Namibia.
But I did come to embrace
this new identity,
and in many ways I think
of myself now as African.
Although I still get quite irritable
when Africa is referred to as a country,
the most recent example being
my otherwise wonderful flight
from Lagos two days ago,
in which there was an announcement
on the Virgin flight
about the charity work in "India,
Africa and other countries."
(Laughter)
So, after I had spent some years
in the U.S. as an African,
I began to understand
my roommate's response to me.
If I had not grown up in Nigeria,
and if all I knew about Africa
were from popular images,
I too would think that Africa
was a place of beautiful landscapes,
beautiful animals,
and incomprehensible people,
fighting senseless wars,
dying of poverty and AIDS,
unable to speak for themselves
and waiting to be saved
by a kind, white foreigner.
I would see Africans
in the same way that I,
as a child, had seen Fide's family.
This single story of Africa ultimately
comes, I think, from Western literature.
Now, here is a quote from the writing
of a London merchant called John Lok,
who sailed to west Africa in 1561
and kept a fascinating
account of his voyage.
After referring to the black Africans
as "beasts who have no houses,"
he writes, "They are also
people without heads,
having their mouth and eyes
in their breasts."
Now, I've laughed
every time I've read this.
And one must admire
the imagination of John Lok.
But what is important about his writing
is that it represents the beginning
of a tradition of telling
African stories in the West:
A tradition of Sub-Saharan Africa
as a place of negatives,
of difference, of darkness,
of people who, in the words
of the wonderful poet Rudyard Kipling,
are "half devil, half child."
And so, I began to realize
that my American roommate
must have throughout her life
seen and heard different versions
of this single story,
as had a professor,
who once told me that my novel
was not "authentically African."
Now, I was quite willing to contend
that there were a number of things
wrong with the novel,
that it had failed in a number of places,
but I had not quite imagined
that it had failed
at achieving something
called African authenticity.
In fact, I did not know
what African authenticity was.
The professor told me that my characters
were too much like him,
an educated and middle-class man.
My characters drove cars.
They were not starving.
Therefore they were not
authentically African.
But I must quickly add
that I too am just as guilty
in the question of the single story.
A few years ago,
I visited Mexico from the U.S.
The political climate in the U.S.
at the time was tense,
and there were debates going on
about immigration.
And, as often happens in America,
immigration became
synonymous with Mexicans.
There were endless stories of Mexicans
as people who were
fleecing the healthcare system,
sneaking across the border,
being arrested at the border,
that sort of thing.
I remember walking around
on my first day in Guadalajara,
watching the people going to work,
rolling up tortillas in the marketplace,
smoking, laughing.
I remember first feeling slight surprise.
And then, I was overwhelmed with shame.
I realized that I had been so immersed
in the media coverage of Mexicans
that they had become one thing in my mind,
the abject immigrant.
I had bought into
the single story of Mexicans
and I could not have
been more ashamed of myself.
So that is how to create a single story,
show a people as one thing,
as only one thing,
over and over again,
and that is what they become.
It is impossible to talk
about the single story
without talking about power.
There is a word, an Igbo word,
that I think about whenever I think about
the power structures of the world,
and it is "nkali."
It's a noun that loosely translates
to "to be greater than another."
Like our economic and political worlds,
stories too are defined
by the principle of nkali:
How they are told, who tells them,
when they're told,
how many stories are told,
are really dependent on power.
Power is the ability not just to tell
the story of another person,
but to make it the definitive
story of that person.
The Palestinian poet
Mourid Barghouti writes
that if you want to dispossess a people,
the simplest way to do it
is to tell their story
and to start with, "secondly."
Start the story with the arrows
of the Native Americans,
and not with the arrival of the British,
and you have an entirely different story.
Start the story with
the failure of the African state,
and not with the colonial
creation of the African state,
and you have an entirely different story.
I recently spoke at a university
where a student told me
that it was such a shame
that Nigerian men were physical abusers
like the father character in my novel.
I told him that I had just read a novel
called "American Psycho" --
(Laughter)
-- and that it was such a shame
that young Americans
were serial murderers.
(Laughter)
(Applause)
Now, obviously I said this
in a fit of mild irritation.
(Laughter)
But it would never have
occurred to me to think
that just because I had read a novel
in which a character was a serial killer
that he was somehow
representative of all Americans.
This is not because I am
a better person than that student,
but because of America's cultural
and economic power,
I had many stories of America.
I had read Tyler and Updike
and Steinbeck and Gaitskill.
I did not have a single story of America.
When I learned, some years ago,
that writers were expected
to have had really unhappy childhoods
to be successful,
I began to think about how I could invent
horrible things my parents had done to me.
(Laughter)
But the truth is that I had
a very happy childhood,
full of laughter and love,
in a very close-knit family.
But I also had grandfathers
who died in refugee camps.
My cousin Polle died because
he could not get adequate healthcare.
One of my closest friends,
Okoloma, died in a plane crash
because our fire trucks
did not have water.
I grew up under repressive
military governments
that devalued education,
so that sometimes, my parents
were not paid their salaries.
And so, as a child, I saw jam
disappear from the breakfast table,
then margarine disappeared,
then bread became too expensive,
then milk became rationed.
And most of all, a kind
of normalized political fear
invaded our lives.
All of these stories make me who I am.
But to insist on only
these negative stories
is to flatten my experience
and to overlook the many other
stories that formed me.
The single story creates stereotypes,
and the problem with stereotypes
is not that they are untrue,
but that they are incomplete.
They make one story become the only story.
Of course, Africa is a continent
full of catastrophes:
There are immense ones,
such as the horrific rapes in Congo
and depressing ones,
such as the fact that 5,000 people apply
for one job vacancy in Nigeria.
But there are other stories
that are not about catastrophe,
and it is very important, it is just
as important, to talk about them.
I've always felt that it is impossible
to engage properly
with a place or a person
without engaging with all of the stories
of that place and that person.
The consequence
of the single story is this:
It robs people of dignity.
It makes our recognition
of our equal humanity difficult.
It emphasizes how we are different
rather than how we are similar.
So what if before my Mexican trip,
I had followed the immigration
debate from both sides,
the U.S. and the Mexican?
What if my mother had told us
that Fide's family was poor
and hardworking?
What if we had an African
television network
that broadcast diverse
African stories all over the world?
What the Nigerian writer Chinua Achebe
calls "a balance of stories."
What if my roommate knew
about my Nigerian publisher,
Muhtar Bakare,
a remarkable man who left
his job in a bank
to follow his dream
and start a publishing house?
Now, the conventional wisdom
was that Nigerians don't read literature.
He disagreed.
He felt that people
who could read, would read,
if you made literature affordable
and available to them.
Shortly after he published my first novel,
I went to a TV station
in Lagos to do an interview,
and a woman who worked there
as a messenger came up to me and said,
"I really liked your novel.
I didn't like the ending.
Now, you must write a sequel,
and this is what will happen ..."
(Laughter)
And she went on to tell me
what to write in the sequel.
I was not only charmed, I was very moved.
Here was a woman, part of the ordinary
masses of Nigerians,
who were not supposed to be readers.
She had not only read the book,
but she had taken ownership of it
and felt justified in telling me
what to write in the sequel.
Now, what if my roommate knew
about my friend Funmi Iyanda,
a fearless woman who hosts
a TV show in Lagos,
and is determined to tell the stories
that we prefer to forget?
What if my roommate knew
about the heart procedure
that was performed in the Lagos
hospital last week?
What if my roommate knew
about contemporary Nigerian music,
talented people singing
in English and Pidgin,
and Igbo and Yoruba and Ijo,
mixing influences from Jay-Z to Fela
to Bob Marley to their grandfathers.
What if my roommate knew
about the female lawyer
who recently went to court in Nigeria
to challenge a ridiculous law
that required women to get
their husband's consent
before renewing their passports?
What if my roommate knew about Nollywood,
full of innovative people making
films despite great technical odds,
films so popular
that they really are the best example
of Nigerians consuming what they produce?
What if my roommate knew about
my wonderfully ambitious hair braider,
who has just started her own business
selling hair extensions?
Or about the millions of other Nigerians
who start businesses and sometimes fail,
but continue to nurse ambition?
Every time I am home I am confronted
with the usual sources of irritation
for most Nigerians:
our failed infrastructure,
our failed government,
but also by the incredible resilience
of people who thrive
despite the government,
rather than because of it.
I teach writing workshops
in Lagos every summer,
and it is amazing to me
how many people apply,
how many people are eager to write,
to tell stories.
My Nigerian publisher and I
have just started a non-profit
called Farafina Trust,
and we have big dreams
of building libraries
and refurbishing libraries
that already exist
and providing books for state schools
that don't have anything
in their libraries,
and also of organizing lots
and lots of workshops,
in reading and writing,
for all the people who are eager
to tell our many stories.
Stories matter.
Many stories matter.
Stories have been used
to dispossess and to malign,
but stories can also be used
to empower and to humanize.
Stories can break the dignity of a people,
but stories can also repair
that broken dignity.
The American writer
Alice Walker wrote this
about her Southern relatives
who had moved to the North.
She introduced them to a book about
the Southern life
that they had left behind.
"They sat around,
reading the book themselves,
listening to me read the book,
and a kind of paradise was regained."
I would like to end with this thought:
That when we reject the single story,
when we realize that
there is never a single story
about any place,
we regain a kind of paradise.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Nine years ago, I worked
for the U.S. government in Iraq,
helping rebuild the electricity infrastructure.
And I was there, and I worked in that job
because I believe that technology
can improve people's lives.
One afternoon, I had tea with a storekeeper
at the Al Rasheed Hotel in Baghdad,
and he said to me, "You Americans,
you can put a man on the moon,
but when I get home tonight,
I won't be able to turn on my lights."
At the time, the U.S. government had spent
more than two billion dollars
on electricity reconstruction.
How do you ensure technology reaches users?
How do you put it in their hands
so that it is useful?
So those are the questions that my colleagues and I
at D-Rev ask ourselves.
And D-Rev is short for Design Revolution.
And I took over the organization four years ago
and really focused it on developing products
that actually reach users,
and not just any users,
but customers who live on
less than four dollars a day.
One of the key areas we've been working on recently
is medical devices, and while it may not be obvious
that medical devices have something in common
with Iraq's electricity grid then,
there are some commonalities.
Despite the advanced technology,
it's not reaching the people who need it most.
So I'm going to tell you about one of
the projects we've been working on,
the ReMotion Knee, and it's a prosthetic knee
for above-knee amputees.
And this project started when
the Jaipur Foot Organization,
the largest fitter of prosthetic limbs in the world,
came to the Bay Area and they said,
"We need a better knee."
Chances are, if you're living on
less than four dollars a day,
and you're an amputee,
you've lost your limb in a vehicle accident.
Most people think it's land mines,
but it's a vehicle accident.
You're walking by the side of the road
and you're hit by a truck,
or you're trying to to jump on a moving train,
you're late for work, and your pant leg gets caught.
And the reality is that if
you don't have much money,
like this young named Kamal right here,
the option you really have
is a bamboo staff to get around.
And how big a problem is this?
There's over three million amputees every year
who need a new or replacement knee.
And what are their options?
This is a high-end. This is
what we'd call a "smart knee."
It's got a microprocessor inside.
It can pretty much do anything,
but it's 20,000 dollars,
and to give you a sense of who wears this,
veterans, American veterans coming
back from Afghanistan or Iraq
would be fit with something like this.
This is a low-end titanium knee.
It's a polycentric knee, and all that that means
is the mechanism, is a four-bar mechanism,
that mimics a natural human knee.
But at 1,400 dollars, it's still too expensive
for people like Kamal.
And lastly, here you see a low-end knee.
This is a knee that's been designed specifically
for poor people.
And while you have affordability,
you've lost on functionality.
The mechanism here is a single axis,
and a single axis is like a door hinge.
So you can think about how unstable that would be.
And this is the type of mechanism
that the Jaipur Foot Organization was using
when they were looking for a better knee,
and I just wanted to give you a sense
of what a leg system looks like,
because I'm showing you all these knees
and I imagine it's hard to think 
how it all fits together.
So at the top you have a socket,
and this fits over someone's residual limb,
and everyone's residual limb is a little bit different.
And then you have the knee,
and here I've got a single axis on the knee
so you can see how it rotates,
and then a pylon, and then a foot.
And we've been able to develop a knee,
a polycentric knee, so that type of knee
that acts like a human knee, mimics human gait,
for 80 dollars retail.
(Applause)
But the key is, you can have this great invention,
you can have this great design, but how do you get it
to the people who most need it?
How do you ensure it gets to them
and it improves their lives?
So at D-Rev, we've done some other projects,
and we looked at three things that we really believe
gets technologies to customers, to users,
to people who need it.
And the first thing is that the product 
needs to be world class.
It needs to perform on par
or better than the best products on the market.
Regardless of your income level,
you want the most beautiful,
the best product that there is.
I'm going to show you a video now
of a man named Ash. You can see him walking.
He's wearing the same knee system here
with a single axis knee.
And he's doing a 10-meter walk test.
And you'll notice that he's struggling 
with stability as he's walking.
And something that's not obvious, that you can't see,
is that it's psychologically draining
to walk and to be preventing yourself from falling.
Now this is a video of Kamal.
You remember Kamal earlier,
holding the bamboo staff.
He's wearing one of the earlier versions of our knee,
and he's doing that same 10-meter walk test.
And you can see his stability is much better.
So world class isn't just about
technical performance.
It's also about human performance.
And most medical devices, we've learned,
as we've dug in, are really designed for Westerners,
for wealthier economies.
But the reality is our users, our customers,
they do different things. They sit cross-legged more.
We see that they squat. They kneel in prayer.
And we designed our knee to have
the greatest range of motion
of almost any other knee on the market.
So the second thing we learned, and this leads
into my second point, which is that we believe
that products need to be
designed to be user-centric.
And at D-Rev, we go one step further and we say
you need to be user-obsessed.
So it's not just the end user
that you're thinking about,
but everyone who interacts with the product,
so, for example, the prosthetist who fits the knee,
but also the context in which the knee is being fit.
What is the local market like?
How do all these components get to the clinic?
Do they all get there on time? The supply chain.
Everything that goes into ensuring
that this product gets to the end user,
and it goes in as part of the system, and it's used.
So I wanted to show you some of the iterations
we did between the first version, the Jaipur Knee,
so this is it right here.
(Clicking)
Notice anything about it?
It clicks.
We'd seen that users had actually modified it.
So do you see that black strip right there?
That's a homemade noise dampener.
We also saw that our users had modified it
in other ways.
You can see there that that particular amputee,
he had wrapped bandages around the knee.
He'd made a cosmesis.
And if you look at the knee,
it's got those pointy edges, right?
So if you're wearing it under pants or a skirt
or a sari, it's really obvious
that you're wearing a prosthetic limb,
and in societies where there's social
stigma around being disabled,
people are particularly acute about this.
So I'm going to show you some
of the modifications we did.
We did a lot of iterations, not just 
around this, but some other things.
But here we have the version three, 
the ReMotion Knee,
but if you look in here, you can see
the noise dampener. It's quieter.
The other thing we did is that
we smoothed the profile.
We made it thinner.
And something that's not obvious is that we
designed it for mass production.
And this goes into my last point.
We really, truly believe that if a product
is going to reach users at the scale that it's needed,
it needs to be market-driven,
and market-driven means that products are sold.
They're not donated. They're not heavily subsidized.
Our product needs to be designed to offer value
to the end user.
It also has to be designed to be very affordable.
But a product that is valued by a customer
is used by a customer,
and use is what creates impact.
And we believe that as designers,
it holds us accountable to our customers.
And with centralized manufacturing,
you can control the quality control,
and you can hit that $80 price point
with profit margins built in.
And now, those profit margins are critical,
because if you want to scale, if you want to reach
all the people in the world who possibly need a knee,
it needs to be economically sustainable.
So I want to give you a sense of where we are at.
We have fit over 5,000 amputees,
and one of the big indicators
we're looking at, of course,
is, does it improve lives?
Well, the standard is, is someone
still wearing their knee six months later?
The industry average is about 65 percent.
Ours is 79 percent,
and we're hoping to get that higher.
Right now, our knees are worn in 12 countries.
This is where we want to get, though,
in the next three years.
We'll double the impact in 2015,
and we'll double it each of
the following years after that.
But then we hit a new challenge,
and that's the number of skilled prosthetists
who are able to fit knees.
So I want to end with a story of Pournima.
Pournima was 18 years old
when she was in a car accident
where she lost her leg,
and she traveled 12 hours by train
to come to the clinic to be fit with a knee,
and while all of the amputees who wear our knees
affect us as the designers,
she's particularly meaningful to me 
as an engineer and as a woman,
because she was in school,
she had just started school to study engineering.
And she said, "Well, now that I can walk again,
I can go back and complete my studies."
And to me she represents the next generation
of engineers solving problems
and ensuring meaningful technologies
reach their users.
So thank you.

I'm going to start here.
This is a hand-lettered sign
that appeared in a mom and pop bakery
in my old neighborhood in Brooklyn a few years ago.
The store owned one of those machines
that can print on plates of sugar.
And kids could bring in drawings
and have the store print a sugar plate
for the top of their birthday cake.
But unfortunately, one of the things kids liked to draw
was cartoon characters.
They liked to draw the Little Mermaid,
they'd like to draw a smurf, they'd like to draw Micky Mouse.
But it turns out to be illegal
to print a child's drawing of Micky Mouse
onto a plate of sugar.
And it's a copyright violation.
And policing copyright violations
for children's birthday cakes
was such a hassle
that the College Bakery said,
"You know what, we're getting out of that business.
If you're an amateur,
you don't have access to our machine anymore.
If you want a printed sugar birthday cake,
you have to use one of our prefab images --
only for professionals."
So there's two bills in Congress right now.
One is called SOPA, the other is called PIPA.
SOPA stands for the Stop Online Piracy Act.
It's from the Senate.
PIPA is short for PROTECTIP,
which is itself short for
Preventing Real Online Threats
to Economic Creativity
and Theft of Intellectual Property --
because the congressional aides who name these things
have a lot of time on their hands.
And what SOPA and PIPA want to do
is they want to do this.
They want to raise the cost
of copyright compliance
to the point where people simply get out of the business
of offering it as a capability to amateurs.
Now the way they propose to do this
is to identify sites
that are substantially infringing on copyright --
although how those sites are identified
is never fully specified in the bills --
and then they want to remove them from the domain name system.
They want to take them out of the domain name system.
Now the domain name system
is the thing that turns human-readable names, like Google.com,
into the kinds of addresses
machines expect --
74.125.226.212.
Now the problem with this model of censorship,
of identifying a site
and then trying to remove it from the domain name system,
is that it won't work.
And you'd think that would be a pretty big problem for a law,
but Congress seems not to have let that bother them too much.
Now the reason it won't work
is that you can still type 74.125.226.212 into the browser
or you can make it a clickable link
and you'll still go to Google.
So the policing layer
around the problem
becomes the real threat of the act.
Now to understand how Congress came to write a bill
that won't accomplish its stated goals,
but will produce a lot of pernicious side effects,
you have to understand a little bit about the back story.
And the back story is this:
SOPA and PIPA, as legislation,
were drafted largely by media companies
that were founded in the 20th century.
The 20th century was a great time to be a media company,
because the thing you really had on your side was scarcity.
If you were making a TV show,
it didn't have to be better than all other TV shows ever made;
it only had to be better
than the two other shows
that were on at the same time --
which is a very low threshold
of competitive difficulty.
Which meant
that if you fielded average content,
you got a third of the U.S. public for free --
tens of millions of users
for simply doing something
that wasn't too terrible.
This is like having a license to print money
and a barrel of free ink.
But technology moved on, as technology is wont to do.
And slowly, slowly, at the end of the 20th century,
that scarcity started to get eroded --
and I don't mean by digital technology;
I mean by analog technology.
Cassette tapes, video cassette recorders,
even the humble Xerox machine
created new opportunities
for us to behave in ways
that astonished the media business.
Because it turned out
we're not really couch potatoes.
We don't really like to only consume.
We do like to consume,
but every time one of these new tools came along,
it turned out we also like to produce
and we like to share.
And this freaked the media businesses out --
it freaked them out every time.
Jack Valenti, who was the head lobbyist
for the Motion Picture Association of America,
once likened the ferocious video cassette recorder
to Jack the Ripper
and poor, helpless Hollywood
to a woman at home alone.
That was the level of rhetoric.
And so the media industries
begged, insisted, demanded
that Congress do something.
And Congress did something.
By the early 90s, Congress passed the law
that changed everything.
And that law was called the Audio Home Recording Act
of 1992.
What the Audio Home Recording Act of 1992 said was,
look, if people are taping stuff off the radio
and then making mixtapes for their friends,
that is not a crime. That's okay.
Taping and remixing
and sharing with your friends is okay.
If you make lots and lots of high quality copies and you sell them,
that's not okay.
But this taping business,
fine, let it go.
And they thought that they clarified the issue,
because they'd set out a clear distinction
between legal and illegal copying.
But that wasn't what the media businesses wanted.
They had wanted Congress
to outlaw copying full-stop.
So when the Audio Home Recording Act of 1992 was passed,
the media businesses gave up on the idea
of legal versus illegal distinctions for copying
because it was clear
that if Congress was acting in their framework,
they might actually increase the rights of citizens
to participate in our own media environment.
So they went for plan B.
It took them a while to formulate plan B.
Plan B appeared in its first full-blown form
in 1998 --
something called the Digital Millennium Copyright Act.
It was a complicated piece of legislation, a lot of moving parts.
But the main thrust of the DMCA
was that it was legal to sell you
uncopyable digital material --
except that there's no such things as uncopyable digital material.
It would be, as Ed Felton once famously said,
"Like handing out water
that wasn't wet."
Bits are copyable. That's what computers do.
That is a side effect of their ordinary operation.
So in order to fake the ability
to sell uncopyable bits,
the DMCA also made it legal
to force you to use systems
that broke the copying function of your devices.
Every DVD player and game player
and television and computer you brought home --
no matter what you thought you were getting when you bought it --
could be broken by the content industries,
if they wanted to set that as a condition of selling you the content.
And to make sure you didn't realize,
or didn't enact their capabilities
as general purpose computing devices,
they also made it illegal
for you to try to reset
the copyability of that content.
The DMCA marks the moment
when the media industries
gave up on the legal system
of distinguishing between legal and illegal copying
and simply tried to prevent copying
through technical means.
Now the DMCA had, and is continuing to have, a lot of complicated effects,
but in this one domain, limiting sharing,
it has mostly not worked.
And the main reason it hasn't worked
is the Internet has turned out to be far more popular and far more powerful
than anyone imagined.
The mixtape, the fanzine,
that was nothing compared to what we're seeing now
with the Internet.
We are in a world
where most American citizens
over the age of 12
share things with each other online.
We share written things, we share images,
we share audio, we share video.
Some of the stuff we share is stuff we've made.
Some of the stuff we share is stuff we've found.
Some of the stuff we share
is stuff we've made out of what we've found,
and all of it horrifies those industries.
So PIPA and SOPA
are round two.
But where the DMCA was surgical --
we want to go down into your computer,
we want to go down into your television set, down into your game machine,
and prevent it from doing
what they said it would do at the store --
PIPA and SOPA are nuclear
and they're saying, we want to go anywhere in the world
and censor content.
Now the mechanism, as I said, for doing this,
is you need to take out anybody
pointing to those IP addresses.
You need to take them out of search engines,
you need to take them out of online directories,
you need to take them out of user lists.
And because the biggest producers of content on the Internet
are not Google and Yahoo,
they're us,
we're the people getting policed.
Because in the end,
the real threat
to the enactment of PIPA and SOPA
is our ability to share things with one another.
So what PIPA and SOPA risk doing
is taking a centuries-old legal concept,
innocent until proven guilty,
and reversing it --
guilty until proven innocent.
You can't share
until you show us
that you're not sharing something
we don't like.
Suddenly, the burden of proof for legal versus illegal
falls affirmatively on us
and on the services
that might be offering us any new capabilities.
And if it costs even a dime
to police a user,
that will crush a service
with a hundred million users.
So this is the Internet they have in mind.
Imagine this sign everywhere --
except imagine it doesn't say College Bakery,
imagine it says YouTube
and Facebook and Twitter.
Imagine it says TED,
because the comments can't be policed
at any acceptable cost.
The real effects of SOPA and PIPA
are going to be different than the proposed effects.
The threat, in fact,
is this inversion of the burden of proof,
where we suddenly
are all treated like thieves
at every moment we're given the freedom to create,
to produce or to share.
And the people who provide those capabilities to us --
the YouTubes, the Facebooks, the Twitters and TEDs --
are in the business
of having to police us,
or being on the hook for contributory infringement.
There's two things you can do
to help stop this --
a simple thing and a complicated thing,
an easy thing and a hard thing.
The simple thing, the easy thing, is this:
if you're an American citizen,
call your representative, call your senator.
When you look at
the people who co-signed on the SOPA bill,
people who've co-signed on PIPA,
what you see is that they have cumulatively received
millions and millions of dollars
from the traditional media industries.
You don't have millions and millions of dollars,
but you can call your representatives,
and you can remind them that you vote,
and you can ask not to be treated like a thief,
and you can suggest that you would prefer
that the Internet not be broken.
And if you're not an American citizen,
you can contact American citizens that you know
and encourage them to do the same.
Because this seems like a national issue,
but it is not.
These industries will not be content
with breaking our Internet.
If they break it, they will break it for everybody.
That's the easy thing.
That's the simple thing.
The hard thing is this:
get ready, because more is coming.
SOPA is simply a reversion of COICA,
which was purposed last year, which did not pass.
And all of this goes back
to the failure of the DMCA
to disallow sharing as a technical means.
And the DMCA goes back to the Audio Home Recording Act,
which horrified those industries.
Because the whole business
of actually suggesting that someone is breaking the law
and then gathering evidence and proving that,
that turns out to be really inconvenient.
"We'd prefer not to do that,"
says the content industries.
And what they want is not to have to do that.
They don't want legal distinctions
between legal and illegal sharing.
They just want the sharing to go away.
PIPA and SOPA are not oddities, they're not anomalies,
they're not events.
They're the next turn of this particular screw,
which has been going on 20 years now.
And if we defeat these, as I hope we do,
more is coming.
Because until we convince Congress
that the way to deal with copyright violation
is the way copyright violation was dealt with with Napster, with YouTube,
which is to have a trial with all the presentation of evidence
and the hashing out of facts and the assessment of remedies
that goes on in democratic societies.
That's the way to handle this.
In the meantime,
the hard thing to do is to be ready.
Because that's the real message of PIPA and SOPA.
Time Warner has called
and they want us all back on the couch,
just consuming --
not producing, not sharing --
and we should say, "No."
Thank you.
